21742,Ракка – последний шанс Вашингтона затянуть сирийский конфликт | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Сирия Как отмечает в своей новой статье пакистанский исследователь Салман Рафи, Вашингтон объявил о начале операции «Сирийских демократических сил» (СДС) по взятию сирийского города Эр-Ракка, которая считается «столицей» ДАИШ. По признанию представителей Вашингтона, СДС состоят из местных боевиков, которых Вашингтон готовил собственноручно. Автор отмечает, что можно с уверенностью сказать, что Запад пытается одержать пропагандистскую победу, раньше, чем сирийские войска при поддержке российских ВКС возьмут город Алеппо. В то же время из Ирака поступают сообщения, что боевики ДАИШ в массовом порядке покидают Моссул, который Вашингтон «штурмует», и движутся в направлении Эр-Ракки. Автор отмечает, что когда подчиняющиеся Вашингтону «Сирийские демократических силы» начнут штурм Эр-Ракки, едва ли что-то помешает боевикам ДАИШ, которые также подчиняются Вашингтону, влиться в их ряды. Нужна столь сложная схема для того, чтобы оттянуть как возвращение Алеппо под правительственный контроль, так и самой Ракки. Ведь в случае, если эти два города будут освобождены, ничто не сможет помешать правительственным войскам одержать решающую победу в Сирии, и Вашингтон об этом знает.

21745,"New York Times Co. Reports a Loss, and a Fall in Digital Ad Revenue - The New York Times","The New York Times Company posted a net loss for the second consecutive quarter, in part because of severance costs related to the closing of the company’s editing and prepress operations in Paris. The company had strong growth in digital subscriptions, it said on Thursday, but digital advertising revenue, which has been a bright spot in the past, declined. In its earnings release, the company said that it had added 51, 000 net   subscriptions in the quarter for its news products and 16, 000 net crossword product subscriptions. The Times now has about 1. 2 million   subscriptions for its news products and more than 1. 4 million total   subscriptions, an increase of more than 25 percent compared with the same time a year ago. During an earnings call with investors, Mark Thompson, the company’s chief executive, struck an optimistic tone. “It was an excellent quarter for audience growth, engagement and our digital subscription business,” he said, adding that The Times drew 126 million unique users in June, and that engagement for nonsubscribers increased 20 percent   . In the next quarter, The Times expects to add 55, 000 to 60, 000 net   subscriptions for its news products and roughly 15, 000 net subscriptions to its crossword product. The company reported a slight net loss of about $500, 000 for the quarter, compared with net income of $16 million in the second quarter of 2015. The company took a charge of roughly $12 million, largely in severance costs related to the Paris closings. Total revenue fell 3 percent, to $373 million from $383 million, in the same quarter a year earlier, as The Times continued to struggle with declining advertising revenue. Total advertising revenue fell about 12 percent, to $131 million. Print advertising revenue slid 14 percent in the quarter, and digital advertising revenue dropped 7 percent, to $45 million. Digital advertising revenue now accounts for more than a third of the company’s total ad revenue. “Digital advertising was somewhat lower than we expected for the quarter,” Mr. Thompson said. Increases in mobile, branded content and programmatic advertising, he added, were “not enough to offset declines in web home page and other traditional display advertising. ” The company expects total advertising revenue to continue to decrease in the   digits next quarter, though it anticipates   growth in digital advertising. Circulation revenue increased about 3 percent, to $219 million, as growth from the company’s digital subscription revenue and an increase in   prices offset a decline in print copies sold. Total daily print circulation declined 6 percent in the quarter, and Sunday circulation fell 4 percent. Circulation revenue from   subscriptions increased 15 percent, to $56 million. Adjusted operating profit, the company’s preferred method of assessing performance, decreased to $55 million in the quarter, from $64 million in the   period. Like many newspapers faced with declining print circulation and falling advertising revenue, The Times has looked for new revenue opportunities. It has focused on virtual reality, video and branded content, for example, and pushed aggressively into Facebook Live. The company produced more than 400 Facebook Live videos in the quarter, Mr. Thompson said. In February, The Times announced a sweeping strategy review of the newsroom that will include reshaping the newsroom for the digital age and identifying areas for  . The company also aims to double its total digital revenue to $800 million by 2020. “We’re taking a good, hard strategic look at costs,” Mr. Thompson said. “You can expect to hear more about that on future earnings calls. ” Charges related to the company’s recent buyout offerings were not reflected in this quarter’s earnings. About 80 Times employees took buyouts. The Times expects to take a severance charge next quarter of about $11 million resulting from the buyouts.",0

Об этом сегодня на брифинге в Москве заявила официальный представитель МИД РФ Мария Захарова, отметив, что постоянно звучат заявления о том, что РФ не выполняет свои обязательства в контексте мирного плана по Сирии. 
""Чтобы прекратить всяческие инсинуации на это тему Российская Федерация приняла решение распространить документ, в котором собраны и приводятся все факты по исполнению российской стороны своих обязательств и невыполнения обязательств американской стороной своих - представлены все факты и цифры"", - рассказала Захарова. 
По ее словам, этот документ будет представлен на площадке ООН не только в Нью-Йорке, но и в Женеве. 
«Приведены факты, даты, цифры. Этот объемный документ уже распространён в Женеве нашим постпредством и будет распространён сегодня российским постпредством при ООН в Нью-Йорке», - подытожила она. 
В ходе брифинга Захарова также обратила внимание на то, что Вашингтон на словах рассуждает о вариантах мирного урегулирования, но не подкрепляет это делом. 
""На деле не исключается вариант пособничества боевика, мы видели, что в 2013 году рассматривались варианты прямой агрессии, а сейчас мы видим, что реально обсуждаются варианты поставки вооружения боевикам"", - заявила официальный представитель МИД РФ. 
Вместе с тем Захарова выразила надежду, что США не станут поставлять тяжелое вооружение умеренной оппозиции в Сирии: ""Мы надеемся, что в американском руководстве разумный и трезвый расчет действительно возобладает над авантюрными подходами, которые могут привести к непредсказуемым военным и политическим последствиям. Будем продолжать следить за реальными действиями Вашингтона"". 
Чем ближе взятие Алеппо, тем яростнее будут обвинения в адрес России , считает сотрудник Центра анализа стратегий и технологий Максим Шеповаленко. Информационные вбросы, подобные истории об российском ударе по школе в провинции Идлиб , будут продолжаться до конца войны. ""Все пошло враздрай: никаких мирных переговоров, вступил в силу План Б - по вооружению боевиков. Значит, информационная война в самом разгаре"" - сказал аналитик в беседе с Pravda.Ru

21752,Jared Kushner Visits Iraq on Invitation From Joint Chiefs Chairman - The New York Times,"Jared Kushner, President Trump’s    landed in Iraq on Monday, military officials said, visiting the country as the American military is aiding Iraqi forces in their brutal fight to retake Mosul from the Islamic State. It was unclear what Mr. Kushner, who has been expanding his reach in his   ’s administration, planned to gain from the trip. Mr. Kushner, 36, who serves as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, was invited by Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Navy Capt. Greg Hicks, a spokesman for the chairman, said early Monday that the general had arrived in Iraq for meetings, including with coalition officials, accompanied by Mr. Kushner and Thomas P. Bossert, the president’s homeland security adviser. The general invited Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bossert to accompany him “to receive an update on the status of the   campaign in Iraq and Syria,” Captain Hicks said. Mr. Kushner is “traveling on behalf of the president to express the president’s support and commitment to the government of Iraq and U. S. personnel currently engaged in the campaign” against the Islamic State, Captain Hicks added. Mr. Trump has repeatedly turned to Mr. Kushner as an envoy to foreign leaders, at times creating a parallel structure to the one led by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. Kushner has had a role in discussions with Mexico, whose government officials have expressed concern over Mr. Trump’s incendiary remarks on trade policy and his vow to build a wall at the border. The president has also charged Mr. Kushner, who has no previous government or diplomatic experience, with a vague edict to establish peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Kushner is also taking the lead in preparing the West Wing for Mr. Trump’s meeting this week with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at    the president’s club in Palm Beach, Fla. In addition, Mr. Kushner has created an Office of American Innovation, which is intended to use ideas from the business world to improve the government.",0
21753,Iran to resume gas exports to Turkey soon,"Iran to resume gas exports to Turkey soon Fri Oct 28, 2016 12:10PM Energy Iran says it will resume exports of natural gas to Turkey by Monday after an explosion in the Turkish territory halted the supplies on Thursday night. 
Iran says its exports of natural gas to Turkey that have been halted reportedly as a result of an explosion inside the Turkish territory will resume within the next few days. 
Sadeq Akbarpour, the head of Gas Exports Measurement Facilities at Iran-Turkey Border, told the domestic media that the required coordination is being carried out with the Turkish Botas company to resume Iran’s exports by next Monday. 
Akbarpour emphasized that Iran is ready to supply Turkey with its required gas whenever it voices its readiness. 
Majid Bojarzadeh, the spokesman of the National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC), also told Iran’s Shana news agency that Ankara had informed Tehran of a problem in the pipeline that carried Iranian gas into Turkey on Thursday night. 
Furthermore, Majid Aqababaei, the director general for border affairs of Iran’s Interior Ministry, acknowledged, as reported by Shana, that an explosion near Iran’s border had caused the problem. 
Iran is Turkey’s second supplier of gas after Russia, providing one-fifth of the country’s consumption. The current volume of natural gas that Iran is piping to its northwestern neighbor is 30 million cubic meters per day (mcm/d). Officials in Tehran had already emphasized that the Islamic Republic is ready to increase its gas exports to Turkey by 6 mcm/d. 
Iran has also for long been working on a plan to export its natural gas to Europe through Turkey. The plan – that was to be carried out though the Nabucco scheme – was eventually put on hold due to a series of technicalities. Nevertheless, officials in Tehran announced last month that the possibility that gas exports to Europe would return to the agenda exist “if the requited agreements with Europeans countries over the plan are reached”.

21754,"Vanity Fair: No, Gal Gadot Isn’t Making 46 Times Less Than Henry Cavill","Vanity Fair has   the recent viral outrage over Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot supposedly being paid 46 times less than Man of Steel star Henry Cavill for their work on similar films. [From Vanity Fair:  “It was a   stat that swiftly went viral Tuesday morning: Gal Gadot, the magnetic star of the summer hit Wonder Woman, was paid just $300, 000 for a film that had already made $573 million worldwide. Meanwhile, Henry’s Cavill had been paid $14 million —  46 times as much! —  for his own first outing as Superman in Man of Steel. It would be perfectly indicative of the gender pay gap that lingers in Hollywood. . . if it were at all true. As the Elle article that sent the stat viral said itself, Cavill’s $14 million earning include bonuses for box office performance, while Gadot’s $300, 000, per a 2014 Variety report, is just the base salary for each film she’s made thus far in the DC Universe,” they continued. “Though the details of Cavill’s reported $14 million could not be verified, a source with knowledge of studio negotiations on franchise films told Vanity Fair, ‘It certainly isn’t for one picture. That’s insane.’ For superhero franchises just getting started, though, the process is usually simple: find a star on the rise, pay them relatively little, and then offer more if the franchise takes off. Marvel pioneered the effort with Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth, all of whom were reportedly paid less than $500, 000 for their first solo superhero outings, but eventually landed much bigger paydays for subsequent entries. (Downey Jr. famously made $50 million for The Avengers, and helped his   negotiate higher salaries themselves.) Cavill, like Hemsworth and Evans and Gadot when their franchises started, was more of an unknown, and likely to have signed the same lowball salary contract with a promise of future returns. Despite Vanity Fair’s explanation, the exaggerated facts, which were pushed by Elle Magazine, have since gone viral, with Teen Vogue‘s Lauren Duca receiving over 10, 000 retweets and 20, 000 likes on an outraged Twitter post, which was also shared by Piers Morgan, who responded, “Now THIS is sexism. ” Gal Gadot made $300, 000 for Wonder Woman as compared to Henry Cavill’s $14M for Man of Steel. The most compelling DC villain is the pay gap.  —   Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) June 20, 2017,  Now THIS is sexism. https:  .   —   Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) June 20, 2017,  You can read the full report at Vanity Fair.

21758,San Francisco: Lowest Percentage of Kids in America - Breitbart,"A new report indicates that San Francisco has the lowest percentage of children of any major city in America. [The report by the New York Times indicates that only 13 percent of San Francisco’s population is under 18 years old.  “Sometimes I’ll be walking through the city and I’ll see a child and think, ‘Hey, wait a second. What are you doing here? ’” Courtney Nam, who works downtown at a tech   told the New York Times. “You don’t really see that many kids. ” The combination of   and distance of public schools has resulted in what can be regarded as a mass exodus of families with   kids to cities that are more affordable. The Times notes that the San Francisco has invested millions in upgrading parks, according to Phil Ginsburg, the general manager of the city’s Recreation and Parks Department. San Francisco Chronicle writer and San Francisco resident Amy Graff  —   who is also a mother to three kids  —   relates her own experience in the city: I was elated when one of my dearest friends finally had a baby, but crestfallen when she decided to move to Lafayette before her son started preschool. I’d assumed her son would grow up with my kids. Same thing happened with another best friend who fled for Mill Valley. My heart eventually numbed to the the mass exodus and I now approach new friendships in the way an army brat might at her third high school. I’m eager to meet new people but hesitant to get too close to protect myself from future partings.",0
21763,Bank of Canada Commentary Whipsaws Loonie,"Bank of Canada Commentary Whipsaws Loonie   
by: otterwood 
Over the last two weeks we’ve seen more evidence of declining confidence in central banks (see my video on eroding confidence in the establishment here ). The Canadian dollar experienced wild swings on the back of comments from the Bank of Canada and Governor Poloz. 
Last Wednesday the Canadian dollar rallied after the Bank of Canada referenced downside risks to inflation and then barely an hour later the Loonie plummeted when Governor Poloz said the committee “actively” considered cutting rates. 
Then on Monday we saw a similar dynamic play out when Poloz said “the best plan right now, we think, is to wait for the next 18 months or so,” in a testimony to the House of Commons. The Loonie strengthened significantly on the comment only to completely reverse when Poloz said the comment referred to the output gap and note monetary policy. 
The lack of consistency in the Bank of Canada’s communication is creating volatility in asset markets and it can be seen in the USDCAD, see below.",0
21765,CodeSOD: Coldly Fused,"Remy Porter Remy escaped the enterprise world and now works as a consultant. Editor-in-Chief for TDWTF. 
In 1989, a pair of physicists claimed to have achieved the fusion of hydrogen at room temperatures. This came as quite a shock to other physicists, since fusion was only known to happen inside of stars. Within a few months, their claims were roundly rejected. Cold fusion became synonymous with junk science. 
Fast forward to 1995. when a small company wanted to make its own set of generous claims about its web application framework. Allaire, Inc (eventually bought out by Macromedia, which itself was eaten by Adobe), claimed that its Cold Fusion could solve all your web development problems. All of your web development challenges could be solved through the judicious application of CFML. 
Fast forward to today, where I’m surprised to learn that ColdFusion is still in active development. Brian recently had the pleasure of attempting to install it. First, he was annoyed at just the install size- 1.2GB for a web runtime and its assorted libraries. Then… the install failed. Brian poked around in the installer and found the following shell script: DISTRO_NAME= GUEST_OS_NAME= if [ -f /etc/issue ] ; then DISTRO_NAME=`cat /etc/issue` fi if [ ! -z ""$DISTRO_NAME"" ] ; then if [ ! -z ""$(echo $DISTRO_NAME | awk '/Ubuntu/')"" ] ; then jre_success=`exec ""$actvm"" 2>&1` case ""$jre_success"" in *No*such*file*or*directory*|*install*bin*|*cannot*execute*binary*file* ) echo ""JRE libraries are missing or not compatible...."" echo ""Exiting...."" ;; *) exec ""$actvm"" $options $lax_nl_java_launcher_main_class ""$propfname""""$envPropertiesFile"" $cmdLineArgs ;; esac elif [ ! -z ""$(echo $DISTRO_NAME | awk '/CentOS/')"" ] ; then jre_success=`exec ""$actvm"" 2>&1` case ""$jre_success"" in *No*such*file*or*directory*|*install*bin*|*cannot*execute*binary*file* ) echo ""JRE libraries are missing or not compatible...."" echo ""Exiting...."" ;; *) exec ""$actvm"" $options $lax_nl_java_launcher_main_class ""$propfname""""$envPropertiesFile"" $cmdLineArgs ;; esac elif [ ! -z ""$(echo $DISTRO_NAME | awk '/SUSE/')"" ] ; then jre_success=`exec ""$actvm"" 2>&1` case ""$jre_success"" in *No*such*file*or*directory*|*install*bin*|*cannot*execute*binary*file* ) echo ""JRE libraries are missing or not compatible...."" echo ""Exiting...."" ;; *) exec ""$actvm"" $options $lax_nl_java_launcher_main_class ""$propfname""""$envPropertiesFile"" $cmdLineArgs ;; esac 
There are a few issues here. First, while /etc/issue is a file that you can reasonably expect a modern Linux system to have, there is no guarantee that it is there, or that its contents will include the identifier of the system distribution. If there isn’t one, the installer makes no attempt to fail over to a different file (like /etc/system-release , which while also not guaranteed, is probably more accurate), or even uname . But that’s all minor details. 
Regardless of what it finds in the /etc/issue file, it executes the exact same command anyway, raising the question of why it even checked in the first place.

21767,Jeff Sessions Senate Intel Committee Testimony Will Be Public,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee will be made in an open hearing. [The announcement came last week that Sessions would follow up   Director James Comey’s testimony before the same committee with his own appearance, but it was speculated that appearance would be in a closed session. The Intelligence Committee’s chairman, Sen. Richard Burr ( ) announced Monday that the attorney general’s testimony will be before the public as Comey’s was last Thursday.  The subject of the hearing, which will take place Tuesday at 2:30 p. m. Eastern Time in the Hart Senate Office Building, will be the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential campaign and the   controversy about Comey’s firing from the FBI and subsequently leaks to the press of potentially privileged memos about his conversations with President Donald Trump. Sessions, who recused himself from all involvement in the Department of Justice’s own Russia investigation, was thrust back into the fracas by Comey’s testimony. The fired FBI head strongly implied that the attorney general refused to protect him from or offer advice on how to deal with an overbearing President Trump. He also posited that he was not made aware of the scope and parameters of Sessions’ recusal. Sessions’ spokesman categorically denied these claims in a statement Friday, offering an email sent to Comey in March laying out the attorney general’s reasons for recusing himself and the extent to which he did so. Among the more striking revelations of Comey’s testimony was his admission that he had himself used   friend and Columbia University law professor, Daniel Richman, to leak the now infamous “let this go” memo on an alleged conversation between himself and the president. Comey further admitted that he did so specifically to force the appointment of a special counsel, a purpose fulfilled when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had been heading the investigation, appointed Comey’s predecessor and mentor Robert Mueller to that position last month. Also likely on the docket will be Sessions’ own interactions with members of the Russian government. The attorney general’s political opponents have made much of his failure to disclose, during his confirmation hearings and on his security clearance application, certain meetings he had, primarily with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, during the 2016 campaign. Despite Sessions’ insistence that all these meetings were made in the scope of his official duties as a United States senator, voices from the left, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) have gone so far as to demand Sessions resign over the matter. Sessions will likely seek to dispel whatever taint Senate Democrats attempt to create over these meetings and clarify the exact chain of events that led to Comey’s dismissal, an action he publicly endorsed at the time. Sessions and Comey’s testimony in rapid succession before the Senate Intelligence Committee is not the first time the two men will lock political horns. As far back as October, Sessions was expressing his misgivings about Comey. The pair’s latest spar will play out before the American public Tuesday afternoon.",0
21773,"Non-Stop Gun Battles Spark Fear, Uncertainty in Mexican Border City","REYNOSA, Tamaulipas  —   The ongoing hunt for the leader of the Gulf Cartel in this border city has led to more than nine days of continuous gun battles. The clashes resulted in the deaths of at least 14 individuals  —  including most of the gunmen. Anecdotal accounts by residents place the death toll much higher.   As Breitbart Texas reported, Mexican authorities have been targeting the leadership of the Gulf Cartel in this city. Officials focused their efforts on capturing or killing Gulf Cartel leader Julian “Comandante Toro” Loisa Salinas, also known as Juan Manuel Loisa Salinas.  Law enforcement officials consulted by Breitbart Texas point to El Toro possibly being forced out of Reynosa and turning control of the plaza to another Gulf Cartel commander. The ongoing violence has sparked rumors about a   curfew placed in the city where residents were asked to not be out on the city streets after a certain hour. Those rumors spread through social media as well as messaging applications raising the level of concern among citizens. Breitbart Texas reached out to Tamaulipas law enforcement officials who stated that government agencies at the local, state nor federal level implemented no such measure. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

[While honoring Tony   actor Billy Porter with the evening’s Vitto Russo Award on behalf of his LGBT advocacy, O’Donnell, who was not previously announced as a presenter at the event, pulled out a cell phone and  “texted” Trump, according to Variety.  “F*ck you. Donald. From, the gays,” O’Donnell said. “Sent. ” The 28th annual GLAAD Media Awards at the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan honored individuals and media properties that best represented acceptance and inclusivity of the LGBT community over the past year. The night’s big honorees included Porter, Daily Show host Trevor Noah, and actress Debra Messing, who was honored with the organization’s Excellence in Media award. O’Donnell also pledged $100, 000 to fight   legislation at the event, according to a GLAAD press release. The actress and comedian has feuded with Trump for years. The award show’s host, television personality Ross Matthews, also took aim at Trump during the event. “We have big stars here tonight. We have more stars than a Trump inauguration,” Mathews said, according to Variety. “To be fair, my Yelp review of the Burger King in Times Square has more stars than Trump’s inauguration. ” Matthews also reportedly noted that the ballroom in which the awards show was being held was the same one used by Trump to deliver his victory speech after winning the presidential election in November. “Since this is the room where Trump won, we’re going to sage the room,” he joked, pulling a stick of incense and a lighter from his pocket. But Matthews and O’Donnell weren’t the only two stars to slam the president during the show. Will and Grace star Messing criticized Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, while accepting the Excellence in Media award. “It’s not enough to simply say that women’s issues are important to you. It’s time to do something. You can change the lives of millions of women and children just by telling your dad stories about real people who are suffering,” Messing addressed Trump’s eldest daughter.  “Please stop blindly defending your father and start defending what you say you believe in,” the actress added.

21782,Hillary Clinton Campaign Manager: We Should Put Out Credible Leaks as Decoys to Detract from the Truth,"Go to Article 
The wickedness of the Hillary Clinton campaign knows no limits. When emails were leaked, Clinton’s campaign manager sent an email to John Podesta suggest not that they admit the truth and repent, but attempt to deceive the American people further by putting out their own leaks as a decoy. 
The Daily Caller reports: 
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign manager wanted to leak an announcement — presumably officially announcing her presidential candidacy — as a “decoy” after the New York Times first reported her email scandal in March 2015. 
“I think we should get a credible leak out that we’re announcing on the 20th. As a decoy,” campaign manager Robby Mook told Clinton adviser John Podesta in a March 12, 2015, email 10 days after the New York Times story broke. The email was made public Monday by Wikileaks. 
Completing this poll entitles you to Daily Caller news updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.Podesta didn’t respond to the email thread and Clinton’s campaign didn’t officially announce her candidacy until April 12, 2015. 
Clinton’s use of private email addresses and a homebrew server located in her New York mansion to conduct official Department of State business and communicate classified information continues to plague her candidacy, with less than one week before the presidential election. 
What are some of these decoys? Several have shown up at the Baltimore Gazette . Then there is this from Reuters. 
Isn’t this just the way Communists operate in putting out their propaganda? I mean we expect it in Communist countries, but this is just outright deception by the Clinton campaign. If you want to know what you would see in a Clinton White House, just recall the lies of Bill Clinton . Then, combine those with the lies of Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah and you might get close to the amount of lies you will be told daily from Hillary Clinton and her administration.  ",0
21783,EMERGENCY: Congress Considers Historic Action Over Comey’s Re-Opening of EmailGate,"1 comment 
James Comey went from being the darling of the left, to their arch nemesis in an instant. When the four devices, including a laptop, were seized in the Anthony Weiner sexting case, over 10,000 of Huma Abedin’s State Department emails were discovered. First off, Comey had a duty to disclose those emails. Second, as far as redemptive opportunities go, this one is golden. Comey gets a chance to do the right thing and remove some of that tarnish from his name and from the FBI. 
Now, Congress is considering holding an emergency hearing this next Friday… just four days before the general election. It’s unprecedented and you can bet the Democrats will try to stall. Comey will star at the hearing and the fact that the Department of Justice is either stalling or just refusing to issue a warrant for those emails is telling. That won’t hold up forever… eventually, a federal judge will step in if the DOJ insists on flaunting more corruption. But timing is everything here. Almost assuredly those laptops that the FBI supposedly destroyed, but didn’t, will come up as well. 
From Western Journalism : 
Both parties in Congress jockeyed for position Saturday in the wake of the dramatic bombshell delivered by the FBI on Friday regarding new evidence that has led the FBI to breathe new life into its investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâs use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. 
Republicans sought to move the issue to the front burner in the week before Election Day, while Democrats castigated the FBI for announcing its probe. 
One report claimed House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, was considering holding a hearing Friday to grill Comey about the most current evidence and investigation. 
Congress is currently on its usual pre-election recess. 
The possibility of a pre-election hearing or briefing was also raised by Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. 
If the hearing happens (and I pray it does), there will be fireworks all the way into election day and beyond. There’s a really good chance now that Trump may win because of all this. If Clinton wins, this scandal will follow her into the White House as will impeachment proceedings and an indictment. We could wind up with her resigning almost immediately and Tim Kaine becoming president. Shudder. 
I doubt that House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz is going to let this slide. He’ll be a bull dog on it and he’ll get his hearing this next Friday probably. Both Clinton and Abedin are going to go down over this. I don’t think Congress has ever faced an emergency quite like this one in our lifetime. Related Items Terresa Monroe-Hamilton

Okay, So I’m just gonna go on ahead and say that the Trumps are an incredible family. Donald is a strong figurehead, his sons are composed, and Ivanka will be the first woman president. Melania just shook the nation with a new, incredible speech (that Michelle Obama cannot claim!) ***Now a new Trump has risen. Earlier today, Melania shook the nation with a new, incredible speech (that Michelle Obama cannot claim!) 
She took the stage in Berwyn, PA and began with a simple smile. Then, Melania opened up and told a story. A story of a little girl growing up in the Soviet Union and dreaming of someday being an American. 
She told how that little girl made it here. She worked hard and got LEGAL citizenship. And now, that same little girl is about to become our next 1st lady. She is that little girl. “When I was 10-years-old we learned that a man named Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States of America. President Reagan’s “morning in America” was not just something in the United States, it began to feel like morning around the world, even in my small country. It was a true inspiration to me.” I think Melania Trump is a true inspiration to American immigrants. She is proof that hard work and dedication can pave the way to success in this country. If you agree and wanna help share this amazing speech out, all you gotta do is send it to all your best Facebook friends who love Trump. We can do this together! ",0
21786,Lyft Is Said to Seek New Funding as Its Rival Uber Stumbles - The New York Times,"Lyft, the   ride hailing company in the United States, is trying to raise more money just as Uber, its bigger rival, grapples with questions about its culture and leadership. Lyft is talking with investors about new   that would put the company’s value around $6 billion, according to three people briefed on the financing who asked to remain anonymous because the proceedings are confidential. One of the people said the valuation could be as high as $7 billion. The company was  valued at $5. 5 billion early last year after investors, including General Motors, poured about $1 billion into it. It is unclear how far along Lyft is with the new   and whether the round will be completed. Lyft, which is based in San Francisco, declined to comment. The funding effort was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. The   may bolster Lyft competitively, given that Uber has been caught up in an escalating series of internal problems. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, has been under scrutiny this year for his participation in an economic advisory council for President Trump amid a social media campaign for people to delete their Uber app. Mr. Kalanick eventually stepped down from the council. Uber has also wrestled with concerns about its workplace culture over the past few weeks, after a former employee published an account of her year at the company, which included allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. In addition, Uber was caught misleading journalists about an accident caused by one of its   cars. And Waymo, the   car business spun out of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, sued Uber last week, claiming it had used technology stolen by one of its employees. This week, Mr. Kalanick apologized for his behavior toward an Uber driver after a video of him losing his temper with the driver surfaced. Lyft has long been the underdog to Uber. Lyft operates only in the United States while Uber is a global company. The two have previously engaged in pricing wars and have   each other. In August, Lyft held discussions with General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing about selling itself. The company could not agree with potential buyers on a price. Yet Lyft’s brand has recently looked comparatively attractive. As Uber struggled with its ties to President Trump’s administration in January, Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union. Lyft’s app subsequently soared to the top of the Apple app store’s download list. Neither Lyft nor Uber has emerged as a financially sound business. Their battle has led them to lower prices and offer deals to lure new customers and maintain their market share. It has been hard for either company to raise prices enough to cover costs. Both Lyft and Uber are still unprofitable and depend on private investment capital to fund their operations.",0
21787,2 Brussels Police Officers Are Stabbed in ‘Potential Terrorist Attack’ - The New York Times,"BRUSSELS  —   A man wounded two police officers with a knife in Brussels around noon on Wednesday in what the authorities called “a potential terrorist attack. ” The two officers were attacked on the Boulevard Lambermont in the Schaerbeek district, just north of the city center. A third police officer, who came to their aid, was also injured. None of the three had   injuries. The man suspected of carrying out the assault was shot in the leg. He was identified only as Hicham D. 43, a Belgian citizen. “The provisional results of the investigation indicate that it would be a potential terrorist attack,” Eric Van der Sijpt, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor’s office, said in a statement. “The investigating judge specializing in terrorism cases will decide later” about the suspect’s “further detention. ” Mr. Van der Sijpt said that Hicham D. was a former soldier and member of the Belgian Armed Forces, but did not say whether he had been cited before in terrorism investigations. Earlier on Wednesday, bomb scares led to the evacuations of the Gare du Nord, one of the city’s three main train stations, and of the building housing the federal prosecutor’s office, which leads terrorism investigations. The police headquarters for western Brussels was also evacuated, although it was not clear whether this was because of a bomb threat. The threats did not appear to be connected to the knife attack, and no bombs were found, the authorities said. The knife attack occurred as international leaders, including Secretary of State John Kerry, gathered a few miles away for a summit meeting hosted by the European Union on aid for Afghanistan. Security was tight for the meeting, which went on as scheduled. Brussels, the Belgian capital and the headquarters for most of the European Union’s core institutions, has been on high alert since March 22, when suicide bombers killed 32 people and injured hundreds of others in coordinated attacks at the city’s airport and at a subway station. There have been several attacks on police officers in the city’s Molenbeek and Schaerbeek districts in recent months. Schaerbeek had several connections to the attacks in March. Bombs used then, and in the November terrorist attacks in Paris, were assembled at an apartment in Schaerbeek. The neighborhood was also home to Najim Laachraoui, one of the bombers at the Brussels airport, and it was the location of a   used by the suicide bombers. The stabbings in Belgium followed several knife attacks in France by French extremists who became radicalized at home and never went to Syria, but who had ties to the Islamic State.",0

21792,Trump’s Budget to Increase Spending for School Choice by $1.4 Billion,"President Donald Trump’s newly released 2018 budget calls for an increase in federal spending on school choice programs by $1. 4 billion, ultimately reaching an annual total of $20 billion. [According to the budget, state and local matching funds for public and private school choice could mean $100 billion total would be spent on such programs.  Additional spending in 2018 on school choice would include: A $168 million increase for charter schools, $250 million for a new private school choice program, and a $1 billion increase for Title I, dedicated to encouraging districts to adopt a system of   based budgeting and open enrollment that enables Federal, State, and local funding to follow the student to the public school of his or her choice. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): A public charter school is a publicly funded school that is typically governed by a group or organization under a legislative contract (or charter) with the state or jurisdiction. The charter exempts the school from certain state or local rules and regulations. In return for flexibility and autonomy, the charter school must meet the accountability standards outlined in its charter. A school’s charter is reviewed periodically (typically every 3 to 5 years) by the group or jurisdiction that granted it and can be revoked if guidelines on curriculum and management are not followed or if the accountability standards are not met. The plan calls for continuing $13 billion in funding for students with disabilities under the IDEA program and $492 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and   Institutions. However, Trump’s proposed budget would eliminate $3. 6 billion in support for programs for instruction support, before and   and summer programs  —   all of which the plan observes, “lack evidence” of meeting the goals of improving student achievement. Trump’s budget plan also calls for either eliminating or reducing “over 20 categorical programs that do not address national needs, duplicate other programs, or are more appropriately supported with State, local, or private funds. ” Among those programs mentioned are: Striving Readers, Teacher Quality Partnership, Impact Aid Support Payments for Federal Property, and International Education programs. Overall, Trump’s budget for next year offers $59 billion in discretionary funding for the federal Department of Education, an amount the plan says represents “a $9 billion or 13 percent reduction below the 2017 annualized CR level. ”",0

21796,Energy Update: Stargates Are Active And We Have Quickening Occurring,"By Lisa Brown
Good morning beautiful light family!
Stargates are active and we have Quickening occurring too. These “shake” the density realms and align all to the light realms.
These align Galactic/Heaven and Earth…. synchronizing realities to higher consciousness ones.
So many experiencing the physicalness of their own separation/unconsciousness, without realizing what is truly occurring now. All when it’s time…. when the heart opens, as one takes their power back, truly opens up fully…..
Those unconscious programs run on a loop cycle, where the human aspect has much to “learn” about SOUL EXISTENCE and living as an ASCENDED BEING here.
The entire external reality teaches us…. IT is our teacher, along with our higher self aspect until we integrate this inside.
There is a process…. first you realize you have a higher self, then you open up to listening to it, then you let it tell you what to do/Guide you…. in every moment… then you become them (They) and THEY dissappear because you ARE THEM…. No more channeling, no more anyone to ask…. You work together, inside, with/AS the entire Universe…. no more separation….
YOU must achieve UNITY CONSCIOUSNESS within you. You don’t need the Universe to push you to step up, YOU STEP UP….. you observe your own humanness, you dissolve/resolve all within you, back into the PURITY of Love……
YOU observe, you see your own patterns and themes. Where you slack, come from lack, where you are holding back, where you judge, don’t support, share, give back, procrastinate and have fear. You see every time you don’t, when you had/have the capability, you see… what you couldn’t before….. you see the ENERGY that you hold that created/creates that…. and that this is all on you to shift/change/transform/do……
WE don’t need lessons anymore, because we are always observing, realizing, shifting, changing, transforming, tuning our own energy intentionally to SOURCE CONSCIOUSNESS and holding this inside at ALL TIMES…. We don’t allow ourselves to separate off anymore to go human…….
You are the one that births NEW EARTH from inside of you and holds all in place. You hold the programming for every reality by what you believe, allow, transmit, do/don’t do… not from your head, but from your fully conscious higher-heart-mind. You don’t get to blame others or be a victim anymore. That scary (fear) for humans. Stepping up and taking responsibility for everything …
Your true power is within you. It’s when you STOP allowing/continuing the old programs yourself. You have to see them first. You break the patterns….
You are here to inspire, support, honor, REMEMBER…… Open up fully. Step up fully. Into your SOUL’s roles….. Your human will always shortchange you……
I love you!

This simple yet phenomenally functional greenhouse quickly and easily folds down to protect your plants during early frosts and cold snaps. When it’s a bit warmer out you can raise it in a brief moment to provide full sun and rain. To get started you need some PVC pipe and plastic, both of which can be found for cheap at most hardware stores. This design is much sturdier than you might think and is perfect for a variety of climates. Make sure to choose a spot that gets at least 6 hours of sun per day, then build it in a single afternoon to protect your plants all season long! If you pick a partially shady spot you will want to check out this article about 40 edible plants that grow in the shade. 
(An important note about plant placement: When you arrange your plants inside the greenhouse, make sure they do not touch the sides or top of the lowered structure. Plastic will actually conduct cold to anything it’s directly touching.)

21799,Left-Wing American ’Constitution’ Society Urges Deep State to Undermine Trump - Breitbart,"The Washington Examiner has published an account of a meeting of the American Constitution Society  —   the left’s version of the conservative Federalist Society of lawyers  —   at which participants discussed how to encourage the “deep state” to undermine President Donald Trump. [Ryan Lovelace of the Examiner reported Saturday:  Forlorn liberals took refuge at the American Constitution Society’s national convention in Washington this week, discussing whether to encourage the growth of the “deep state” resistance inside the government or fight President Trump from outside.   …     UCLA law professor Jon Michaels said he favors filling the Trump administration with liberals opposed to Trump’s agenda. “We hear a lot of language about draining the swamp and this idea about a deep state that somehow was going to thwart the intentions or the political mandate of the president,” Michaels said. “I kind of embrace this notion of the ‘deep state. ’” Michaels listed his ideas for how to ensure the success of the “deep state. ” Act as a group  —   a department, across agency lines, as a community  —   rather than as an individual when pushing back against Trump from the inside, he said. Once such a coalition is formed, he suggested “rogue tweeting” or “leaking to the media” as options for fighting the president. Some present also discussed the possibility of using federalism to oppose Trump. For more than a century, liberals have opposed federalism, preferring rule by the federal government over allowing states to govern their own affairs. However,   states like California have newfound enthusiasm for federalism  —   although their version has more to do with ignoring federal law altogether, rather than exercising state powers and prerogatives.

21802,Hannity Offers to PAY 1-Way Ticket for Obama to Kenya After Leaving White House,"BREAKING: Obama ATF Accused of Covering Up Political Element in Firebombing of GOP HQ 
“I will charter it to the country of your choice. You want to go to Canada? I’ll pay for you to go to Canada. You want to go to Kenya? I’ll pay for you to go to Kenya. Jakarta (in Indonesia), where you went to school back in the day, you can go back there,” the talk show host offered. 
He even said he would supply caviar and champagne on the flight. He added that he only had one stipulation, and that was that Obama could never return to America. 
Hannity made his offer the day after White House press secretary Josh Earnest dodged a question about whether Obama would leave the country if Trump won the presidency.   
“He’s working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn’t support,” Earnest told reporters on Monday. 
What Earnest chooses not to realize is that there are some Democrats we’d love to see leave the country should GOP nominee Donald Trump be elected president. Not to mention there are literally thousands of conservatives who would be more than happy to pitch in on this one-way ticket to get Obama and a few others — looking at you, Rosie O’Donnell — out of this country forever. 
That would make a couple fewer destructive liberals for conservatives to have to deal with. Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is enough of a problem , and it would be nice to know that her predecessor couldn’t do any more damage to our country, except maybe by telecommuting. 
Obama did not immediately respond to Hannity’s offer — at least not that we know of.  ",0
21803,The Hard to Swallow Truth About Turkey Day,"Waking Times 
“Does anyone even know why we eat turkey every Thanksgiving? Does anyone even know why we have Thanksgiving? Is it just to eat turkey?” ~ Erin Janus 
Another Thanksgiving holiday is upon us, and the tradition of coming together with family to celebrate a vague connection to our heritage as conquerors of North America will be celebrated by millions of people. This year, however, Thanksgiving is all the more ironic given the circumstances unfolding at the Standing Rock Indian Revolution over the Dakota Access Pipeline where Native Americans are being brutalized by militarized police who are protecting a corporate project. 
So what is the true story of Thanksgiving? A brief history lesson: 
“The first actual proclaimed “Day of Thanksgiving” came in 1637 in a meeting between the Pequot Indians and English religious mercenaries. The Pequot were celebrating their annual Green Harvest Festival, which resembles modern-day Thanksgiving. On the eve of the festival, the English demanded that everyone comes out of their homes, puts their weapons on the ground, and surrenders by converting to Christianity. 
Those who obliged with these terroristic demands were either shot dead or clubbed to death. Those who stayed inside their longhouses – including women and children – were burnt to death. In all, more than 700 Pequot men, women, and children were slaughtered that day. 
The “victory” was celebrated by the Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony holding a feast and trumpeted this as a “Day of Thanksgiving.” During the celebration, they cut off heads of Natives and put them on display publicly; including beheading the Wampanoag Chief and impaling his head on a pole in Plymouth which stayed on display for the next 24 years.” ~ Irwin Ozborne 
Beyond the historical context of Turkey Day, there is a modern aspect of this story that needs to be outed and understood. 
Modern meat farming has become the most horrifying and inhumane practice on planet earth. While some activists work to expose the shocking abuses that routinely take place in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO’s), the meat industry and the National Grocers Association is constantly working to avoid the public relations nightmare that publicity would certainly bring. 
Ag-gag laws criminalize activism with the aim of keeping consumers in the dark, and the largest meat companies have engineered a top-down system of farm control where individual farmers are under severe contracts, having no say whatsoever on how animals are housed and treated. 
Never the less, the issue of animal cruelty as an embedded part of our food supply is something which needs to be brought into the light of day and exposed, for there truly are much more healthier and humane ways of feeding ourselves. 
To this end, and to bring awareness to the ritual insanity of Thanksgiving turkey dinners, filmmaker and activist Erin Janus presents ‘Turkey Day,’ a short film about the week’s festivities. A word of warning, though, for some of the content in this video, while 100% real, is genuinely disturbing.

21806,ITALY: African Muslim illegal alien freeloaders are demanding to have designer clothes and better food,"ITALY: African Muslim illegal alien freeloaders are demanding to have designer clothes and better food African MUSLIM illegal migrants who took the streets in protest and blocked traffic in Venice this week are now demanding real designer clothes (Armani and Hugo Boss), no knockoffs, and say they don’t like having to eat so much pasta in their meals. Breitbart (h/t Emma) Lorenzo Chinalleto, whose cooperative hosts migrants at the Hotel Byron in the Venice province, said migrants respond with displeasure when receiving clothes from Catholic charity Caritas and other charitable bodies, because the goods are unbranded. He explained: “Unfortunately they come to Italy with the asylum reception systems of northern Europe as a model. When they arrived we gave them clothes, standard clothes. “But they want brand-name clothes like Armani and Boss, and they asked for Pirelli shoes. These are their models. When they came to us, they didn’t have clothes, but they all had smartphones,” the Italian added . Forty of the migrants hosted at the Hotel Byron took to the streets to express their dissatisfaction, blocking the traffic. In a video (below) taken outside the hotel on Monday protesters can be seen shouting, in English, that they don’t want to eat pasta. The migrants originate mostly from Senegal, Nigeria, Somalia, Mali and Ghana, Il Gazzettino reported . Migrants frequently hit the headlines in Italy protesting their living conditions in the country, which has recently been hit hard by several earthquakes. In May a group of “unaccompanied minors” launched a violent protest in order to be transferred from Fondachelli Fantina, complaining that there were “too few entertainment possibilities” in the town. After they had completely destroyed the reception centre to the point where it cannot be used again, the Interior Ministry transferred the migrants to a luxury hotel. In June migrants staying in a small town in Sardinia protested for several days demanding better meals, a television set in every room, and a daily coach to take them to the island’s capital, Cagliari. Tensions in the town ran high as the migrants brandished sticks and smashed property. Regional director of the populist Sardinian Action Party, Marcello Orrù, commented on the controversy. He said: “It is intolerable for us to continue to accept these people who don’t like the welcome offered, the meals and their lodgings at the hotel for free. And who then protest to have a television in the room and a daily bus take them to Cagliari for free. “It’s too easy to accuse us of racism and xenophobia, but we refuse to accept this total and grave injustice to the Sardinian people. These boys are muscular and equipped with the latest model iPhones. “I say if they want a TV in the room and maybe even a masseuse, they must be loaded on a ship and sent back to Africa immediately. With a one-way ticket”.",0

À la fin de l’été, deux personnages identiques sont apparus sur Instagram : de grands hommes grisonnants, riches, dépensiers, passant tous deux leur temps à voyager et à faire la fête en charmante compagnie. L’un est l’italien Gianluca Vacchi, l’autre le russe Boris Bork. L’un d’entre eux vit vraiment une vie de rêve, l’autre est un imposteur. Par Daria Donina 
Cette semaine, le réseau social russe a été le théâtre de débats acharnés au sujet du faux compte du « riche » retraité russe Boris Bork, lorsque le spécialiste en relations publiques moscovite Roman Zaripov a annoncéêtre derrière l’ Instagram de Boris Bork. 
En mars 2016, Roman Zaripov et ses amis ont décidé de faire une expérience : combien de temps et d’argent faut-il pour devenir une superstar d’Instagram ? La réponse : 50.000 roubles (moins de mille euros) et un peu de chance. 
Roman et Mikhaïl ont trouvé leur héros sur les réseaux sociaux : Boris Bork (le nom est imaginaire), un retraité moscovite de 65 ans. Il était « loin de l’image d’un riche » , ne vivait que de sa retraite et louait un une-pièce dans la banlieue de Moscou, mais il avait l’air « cool » , selon Zaripov. 
Quelques heures après le premier post sponsorisé sur le réseau social russe vk.com , Boris avait 2000 abonnés. Lorsque le nombre d’abonnés atteignit 8000, Boris fut invité par la chaîne de télévision Russie 1 à un talk-show sur « la vieillesse heureuse », et les marques de mode ont commencéà lui proposer de participer à leurs campagnes publicitaires. Bork recevait des messages privés d’hommes d’affaires lui proposant de coopérer, et même de jeunes femmes. 
Désormais, l’expérience est terminée, Roman a décidé qu’il était trop difficile d’investir de l’argent dans l’entourage et les accessoires de ces photos truquées. Mis à jour pour la dernière fois il y a 17 semaines, l’Instagram de Boris Bork continue d’attirer les abonnés. Il en a maintenant plus de 18.000.",0

On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” Representative Ted Lieu ( ) commented on the New York Times’ report that President Trump called FBI Director James Comey a “nutjob” and told Russian officials that firing Comey relieved “great pressure” by stating Trump committed “a classic case of obstruction of justice, a federal crime. ”  Lieu said, “Let me say that, we no longer just have smoke. We have a raging,   fire at the White House. As a former prosecutor, what the president did, in firing James Comey, and then saying he did it to relieve pressure on himself because of the FBI investigation is a classic case of obstruction of justice, a federal crime.

21814,US-Supported Terrorists Shell Russian Embassy In Damascus,"in: War Propaganda , World News (© Omar Sanadiki / Reuters) They’ve done it before without causing casualties or damage. According the Russian Foreign Ministry, terrorists fired two mortar rounds at the embassy’s compound. One shell exploded near the diplomatic mission’s entrance, damaging the building and four vehicles. The attack came from terrorist-controlled Jobar district. On Friday, the Security Council addressed the incident, saying its “members…condemned in the strongest terms another mortar shelling of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Damascus (Syrian Arab Republic), which caused significant material damage.” They stressed the “fundamental principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises.” Host governments are obligated “to take all appropriate steps to protect diplomatic and consular premises against any intrusion or damage, and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of these missions or impairment of their dignity, and to prevent any attack on diplomatic premises, agents and consular officers.” Not easily done when countries are attacked by foreign-supported death squads, supplied with heavy weapons to wage war. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed concern over no “international reaction…but we will try to get it,” she said, including on the platform of international organizations, because we are talking about a diplomatic mission, about systematic terrorist attacks.” Russian upper house Federation Council Security and Defense Committee first deputy chairman Frants Klintesevich believes the latest shelling was conducted to disrupt Moscow’s humanitarian pause, saying it failed – nor can there be an “option of making any concessions to terrorists.” Separately, heavily US-led Western pressure got General Assembly members to vote Russia off the UN Human Rights Council – a body infested with major human rights abusers, including reelected member Saudi Arabia with over a three-fourths majority vote. Ignored was its genocidal war on Yemen, ruthless despotic rule tolerating no dissent, arbitrary arrests and imprisonments, torture and physical abuse, public beheadings and whippings, violence against women, along with other major violations of civil and human rights. Russia, Hungary and Croatia vied for two Eastern European seats. Moscow’s UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said “(i)t was a very close vote and very good countries competing, Croatia, Hungary. They are fortunate because of their size, they are not exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. Russia is very exposed. We’ve been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in.” Not easily as long as Washington maintains pressure to prevent it.

[Last Man Standing ran for six seasons on ABC before being cancelled on Wednesday. The sitcom centered on Allen’s Mike Baxter, a   marketing director for a sporting goods store and his relationship with his wife Vanessa (Nancy Travis) and his three teenage daughters (Molly Ephraim, Kaitlyn Dever, and Amanda Fuller).  The show was one of the few (if not the only) on broadcast television to appeal to conservative,   audiences taken together with Allen’s own political conservatism, some Last Man Standing fans have accused   ABC of cancelling the show for political reasons, particularly because the series drew relatively strong ratings in its Friday night time slot. Over the weekend, fans of the show took to social media to call for a boycott of the network, while some urged other platforms like Netflix and CMT to pick it up. @starcrosswolf @ABC @AnitaWhiteee @RobertsRooms @gotspeed2burn @1Talking_Stick @mary_p7mary3 @mollyday15 @LibertyNews1776 @CB618444 . @ABCNetwork Is your goal to make money?

But a Deadline report this month suggested that the network, now responsible for the cost of producing the show at this point in its run, balked at the price tag. Whatever the reason, fans were not yet ready to see it go. At least a   petitions have been launched on Change. org to attempt to persuade either ABC or another network to give Last Man Standing new life. The most popular petition had already gathered more than 10, 000 signatures as of Monday morning. “Last Man Standing is one of the only shows on broadcast television, and the only sitcom, that is not constantly shoving liberal ideals down the throats of the viewers. And sadly, that is likely the real reason the show has been cancelled,” wrote the petition’s creator. “The intent of this   is to attempt to get ABC to renew the show. With that in mind, I will no longer be watching any ABC shows. I have cancelled the DVR settings for the other ABC shows that I regularly watch. If you want to help try to save Last Man Standing, I encourage you to do the same. ” Fans do have some precedent to be hopeful for a   renewal.

21819,College Professors Organize National ‘Teach-In’ to Challenge ‘Trumpism’ - Breitbart,"Some 25 colleges and universities  —   many of them public  —   have answered a call by professors at UCLA to use their regular class time to “teach, organize, and resist” what they view as the discriminatory political agenda of   Donald Trump. [Slated for Wednesday, January 18, the   dubbed #J18, is taking place between the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday and Trump’s inauguration. The event’s planners say:  Let it be known that on #J18 and beyond, universities, colleges, and high schools refused to bear silent witness to the politics of hate and fear that in these times, these places of teaching and learning not only served as a sanctuary for its students and workers but also stood up to proclaim the power of knowledge on the frontlines of social justice. On January 18, the professors are calling upon their colleagues to “Teach, Organize, Resist,” and “affirm the role of critical thinking and academic knowledge in challenging Trumpism. ” They continue: On that day, we intend to teach about the agendas and policies of the new administration, be it the proposed dismantling of economic and environmental regulations or the threatened rollback of the   rights that form the fragile scaffolding of American democracy. On that day, we intend to organize against the proposed expansion of state violence targeting people of color, undocumented people, queer communities, women, Muslims, and many others. On that day, we intend to resist the institutionalization of ideologies of separation and subordination, including white supremacy, misogyny, homophobia, Islamophobia, and virulent nationalism. In addition to UCLA, universities participating in the event to date include: American University, Washington, D. C. University of California, Berkeley University of Cincinnati University of Dayton University of Minnesota New York University Princeton University Texas State University University of Kentucky Vanderbilt University and University of Washington. An editable flyer for the event states: “January 18, 2017, is a day to Teach, Organize, Resist.

21822,BET: Katy Perry Latest ‘White Pop Act’ to Appropriate ‘Black Urban Culture’,"Pop superstar Katy Perry has again been accused of cultural appropriation, with critics now saying the singer is stealing elements of black culture for use in her latest music. [In a searing article published on BET. com Wednesday, Keith Murphy says the    singer has “become the latest white pop act looking to reinvent themselves on the back of Black urban culture. ”  Murphy  —   pointing to what he called the “Firework” singer’s “cringeworthy” May 20 Saturday Night Live performances, one which featured Atlanta rap trio Migos —   says Perry is no longer the “bubbly, witty and at times   brunette who had began her professional career in 2001 as a virginal contemporary Christian music vocalist before hitting peak pop superstar levels. ” “In her place stood a static individual who was hardly recognizable,” Murphy wrote. Perry’s performance of her   single “Bon Appétit” on SNL last week was heavily panned by critics online and on social media (and in the comments section on YouTube). Perry’s            act was called “odd” by Spin and became the subject of several memes  —   many of them accusing the singer of exploiting black culture.

A post shared by snoopdogg (@snoopdogg) on May 23, 2017 at 11:22am PDT,  Murphy writes: “By the end of the entire   ordeal, you were left to wonder: What the hell happened to Katy Perry? And why did the      pop protagonist, who first arrived on the pop music scene in 2008 feel the need to Blacken things up?” Perry’s past collaborations with black musicians, including “Snoop Dogg (“California Gurls”) Kanye West (“E. T. ”) and Juicy J (“Dark Horse”) Murphy writes, were “all done on equal, seamless footing like David Bowie’s mid ‘70s exploration of Philly soul. ” However, Murphy notes, Perry’s most recent reinvention and “the stumbling drum up to Perry’s upcoming fifth album Witness has so far been craven in its attempts to create a spark by injecting some Black girl magic. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson",0
21824,Miracle Birth in Poland: A Baby Born in 55 Days After Its Mother’s Death,"posted by Eddie A child was born in 55 days after the death of its mother. Doctors declared the woman brain-dead, but she was kept alive in this hospital in Poland till the birth of her child. The 41-year-old woman had a brain tumor. Doctors say she didn’t want to be operated on. She was afraid of the risks. She was brought to the clinic in Wroclaw in November unconscious with no brain activity. Doctors found out that the she was 17 weeks pregnant when they heard the baby’s heartbeat. The medics decided to save the child. So they had to extend the woman’s life for at least two months. Anesthesiologists, neonatologists, gynecologists and neurosurgeons were working as one team to save the baby’s life. Every day they had to fight the infections and disorders in the mother’s body. Neonatologists said that we have to support the mother until 30 weeks of pregnancy. But it’s too long for the brain-dead body, because the organism can have a lot of disorders. Gynecologists set the goal to prolong the mother’s life to at least 25 weeks of pregnancy. This is a minimum for the fetus to grow until it can be born and get a chance to live. After Cesarean section Wojtek was born. The boy weighed only 1 kilogram. His dad patiently waited for the birth for 55 days reading him fairy tales. A little boy was put in intensive care and spent three months in an incubator. A few days ago a boy and his dad were discharged from the hospital and they are finally at home. Now Wojtek weighs 3 kilograms and he is doing well. Each of the 145 days that his father spent in the hospital was very hard for him. He doesn’t want to share this unique story with strangers.

21825,"Donald Trump Probably Stanched His Losses, but Didn’t Seem to Gain - The New York Times","The bar was low for Donald J. Trump after the worst two weeks for a presidential campaign in recent memory, and he seemed to clear it at Sunday’s debate. Another decisive loss in a   with Hillary Clinton could have led to a mass revolt from Republican officials and raised the possibility of a landslide defeat in November. It’s too soon to be sure that Mr. Trump staved off further defections from the Republican leadership. But if they abandon him, it will probably not be because of this performance. He did not do more damage beyond what was already done by a videotape that emerged on Friday, when Mr. Trump was heard bragging about groping women and getting away with it because he was a celebrity. Many commentators argued that Mr. Trump held his own Sunday night some argued he won the debate outright. And his tactics  —   intentionally or not  —   probably made it harder for the Republican establishment to abandon him. He gave a lot of red meat to the G. O. P. base, calling Mrs. Clinton a liar and calling for her imprisonment. By energizing his supporters, he made it more challenging for Republicans to rescind their support. But Mr. Trump’s performance did not seem strong enough to change the dynamics of a race that has moved sharply against him over the last few weeks. Mrs. Clinton had a considerable lead even before Friday. The Upshot’s model gives him just a 17 percent chance of winning the election, based on   and   polls. Mr. Trump’s challenge got considerably worse over the weekend, after the release of the videotape led dozens of Republican officials to drop their endorsements. And he didn’t seem to go out of his way Sunday to try to broaden his support. The   polls suggest as much: According to the CNN poll, Mrs. Clinton won the debate, 57 to 34 percent. But 63 percent of voters said that Mr. Trump did better than expected. A YouGov poll found that Mrs. Clinton won the debate by five percentage points, but that she was more presidential by a margin of 57 to 31. Instant polls are not always especially representative of the electorate, but both findings tell two sides of the same story: Mr. Trump may have averted total calamity, but he did not do so well as to fundamentally alter the race. Mr. Trump needs something big to break his way, and soon. It is quite possible that the next set of polls will show him trailing by a large margin  —   by more than the   or   deficit he faced before the release of the videotape. It’s hard to imagine that the polls will show Mr. Trump faring any better than he was ahead of that news. Needless to say, even if his deficit remained at five or six points, he would not be well positioned to win. If the polls show him slipping farther, he will need to make a bigger turnaround over the last month than any modern presidential candidate has been able to accomplish.",0

The Watergate Burglars “Plumbers” were CIA assets, Operation 40 counterparts… 
Ironic that the author Timm Amundson, doesn’t mention HRC’s inclusion on the House Judiciary Committee Impeachment Inquiry staff in 1974 . 
At the time of Watergate I had overall supervisory authority over the House Judiciary Committee’s Impeachment Inquiry staff that included Hillary Rodham—who was later to become First Lady in the Clinton White House. 
During that period I kept a private diary of the behind the scenes congressional activities. My original tape recordings of the diary and other materials related to the Nixon impeachment provided the basis for my prior book, Without Honor, and are now available for inspection in the George Washington University Library. 
After President Nixon’s resignation, a young lawyer, who shared an office with Hillary, confided in me that he was dismayed by her erroneous legal opinions and efforts to deny Nixon representation by counsel—as well as an unwillingness to investigate Nixon. In my diary of August 12, 1974 I noted the following: 
John Labovitz apologized to me for the fact that months ago he and Hillary had lied to me [to conceal rules changes and dilatory tactics]. Labovitz said, ‘That came from Yale.’ I said, ‘You mean Burke Marshall’ [Senator Ted Kennedy’s chief political strategist, with whom Hillary regularly consulted in violation of House rules.] Labovitz said, ‘Yes.’ His apology was significant to me, not because it was a revelation but because of his contrition. 
At that time Hillary Rodham was 27 years old. She had obtained a position on our committee staff through the political patronage of her former Yale law school professor Burke Marshall and Senator Ted Kennedy. Eventually, because of a number of her unethical practices I decided that I could not recommend her for any subsequent position of public or private trust.",0

Early signs that they were all out today came this morning, as remarked upon by local man Harold Fennihan as he made the school run with his two kids. 
“You allow for one or two of them when you’re out and about, but they were all out this morning,” said Fennihan, speaking exclusively to WWN, “Every junction, every turn, everywhere I went, there was another of them. I said it to the kids, I said look; they’re fuckin’ all out today. Turns out it wasn’t just Waterford, it was countrywide. God help us all”. 
No explanation is currently available as to why they’re all out today, but theories range from the changing of the seasons to a comet passing closer to Earth than expected, with others suggesting that the phenomenon is a sign that God is angry with humanity. 
Regardless, it is important to remain calm, and hope that they won’t be all out tomorrow.",0

К слову сказать, сама актерская игра Херд в этом фильме сразу же отошла на второй план: роль у стройной блондинки со стандартной внешностью тоже была вполне традиционная, и ничего особого при ее исполнении Эмбер не показала. 
Возможно, никто бы не запомнил эту девушку, и ей суждено было затеряться в стройных рядах многочисленных голливудских красавиц, если бы не умение актрисы обрастать скандалами на ровном месте. В последнее время тридцатилетняя Эмбер Херд настолько часто появлялась в новостных заголовках, что ей могли бы позавидовать многие матерые западные звезды. Сначала все мировые СМИ на разные лады расписывали роман молодой актрисы с Джонни Деппом. А когда парочка подтвердила свои отношения, журналисты получили новую почву для обмусоливания: кто же такая эта малоизвестная девушка, если сумела разбить одну из самых крепких и романтичных пар Голливуда? Вскоре после этого все вспомнили и об истории пятилетней давности, когда Эмбер открыто заявила о своей бисексуальности. 
Когда церемония бракосочетания Херд и Деппа наконец состоялась, можно было предположить, что девушка наконец перестанет быть одним из основных ньюсмейкеров актерской среды. Но вскоре последовал не менее громкий развод: то сама Эмбер, которая до этого встречалась с Джонни на протяжении трех лет, обвиняла актера в психологическом и физическом насилии, то ее бывший супруг заявлял, что Херд хочет на нем нажиться. В общем, примерно так оно и произошло: деньги, которые выплатил ей бывший муж, Эмбер пустила на благотворительность, но вот звездной славы поднабралась на несколько лет вперед. 
Эта буря тоже улеглась, но ничего не изменилось: вот она, Эмбер Херд, снова в новостных заголовках. На этот раз из-за того, что актриса отказалась раздеться во время съемок фильма «Лондонские поля». И это притом, что девушка прочитала книгу, сценарий, а после этого подписала все документы об участии в картине, ни разу не заикнувшись о необходимости пересмотреть постельные сцены. Теперь продюсеры фильма решили подать на Херд в суд, дабы взыскать с нее 10 миллионов долларов за нарушение контракта. 
К слову сказать, сама картина на международном кинофестивале в Торонто провалилась. То ли отсутствие постельных сцен подвело, то ли игра актрисы в целом, то ли фильм изначально не подавал особых надежд. Ну а Эмбер Херд при своей скромной фильмографии в очередной раз получила от ситуации все. Вероятно, мы еще не раз о ней услышим, а вот увидим ли когда-нибудь ее пронзительно талантливую игру – большой вопрос.",0

21836,Trump Administration Moves to Embrace Tax Cuts and Growth-Even if Deficits Grow - Breitbart,"The Trump administration is swiftly moving to an embrace of a tax plan that emphasizes rate cuts and economic growth over concerns about the budget deficit. [Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reflected this in answer Monday to a question from the White House press corps. Mnuchin said the administration’s tax plan would focus on a   tax cut, tax simplification, and making U. S. businesses more competitive.  Asked if the plan would be revenue neutral, meaning any reductions in expected revenue from tax cuts would be offset from increases in revenue or spending cuts elesewhere, Mnuchin instead said the plan would “pay for itself” through economic growth. This is a signal that the administration may be planning to put forth a tax proposal that the Congressional Budget Office would forecast as increasing the deficit. While some Capitol Hill budget hawks reflexively oppose deficit spending, Trump has long been perceived as being more open to debt financed government spending. Many   believe that tax cuts that produce economic growth can “pay for themselves,” even if official government forecasts don’t reflect that view. Budget deficits arise when the federal government issues bonds to investors instead of balancing all of its spending with taxes and fees on households and businesses. They can be increased when tax cuts reduce revenue and aren’t offset with spending cuts. They fall when the government increases the amount of money taxed relative to spending, which reduces the share of the budget funded by  . Since Treasuries are dollar denominated, there is no risk that the United States government will not be able to repay its debt, as the government can always pay debt issued in the currency it controls. The only risk to the economy that deficits create is higher inflation. Despite several years of historically high deficits, all indicators say that inflation will remain quite low for decades to come. During a meeting inside the Oval Office last week, President Donald Trump said that he wants massive tax cuts, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. He ordered them to prepare a plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 15% prioritizing tax cuts over attempts not to increase the deficit, according to “a person familiar with the directive” who spoke with WSJ. Top lawmakers are scheduled to meet with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn on Tuesday to discuss the administration’s tax proposals. Trump plans to make a major announcement on tax policy on Wednesday.",0

21838,"Police: Concealed Carry Permit Holder Shoots, Kills ’Active Shooter’ - Breitbart","On Wednesday night a concealed carry permit holder shot and killed an alleged “active shooter” at Zona Caliente Sports Bar in Arlington, Texas. [The incident occurred around 6:15 pm. WFAA reported, “A man opened fire at the Zona Caliente Sports Bar  …     but police say a customer with a gun of his own put a stop to it. ”  The man reported to police as an “active shooter” was    James Jones. He allegedly walked into Zona Caliente, began arguing with the manager  —      Cesar Perez  —   and then pulled out a gun and killed Perez. At that moment a concealed carry permit holder responded by pulling his own gun and killing Jones. The unidentified permit holder had to come down from “the other end of the bar” to intervene and stop Jones. Arlington Police Department Lt. Christopher Cook said, “[The concealed permit holder] made the decision to engage the shooter, fearing there would be other loss of life. ” Police do not yet have a motive in the shooting of Perez, but they have made clear that the concealed permit holder will face no charges for the actions he took to be sure no other innocents were harmed.

21843,Boy George Defends Melania Trump from ’Mean-Spirited’ Attacks,"English pop singer and fashion icon Boy George defended Melania Trump against “ ” attacks from women who he says have harshly judged the First Lady’s former modeling career. [“I was criticizing people this morning for attacking Melania and saying horrible things,” Boy George told the Hollywood Reporter at the Dior Homme show on Saturday.  “You know what? As somebody who has a past, I think it’s really wrong and   of women to be so abusive,” he added, further noting that the First Lady’s Herve   inauguration gown “looked amazing. ” But the   artist also sounded a note of apprehension about Donald Trump’s presidency. “A leader is supposed to be compassionate and inclusive that’s a real leader,” George told THR. “Being strong isn’t necessarily the answer. It takes strength to be compassionate and to think about people you maybe don’t understand. ” George’s defense of Melania Trump comes on the heels of reports that several renowned fashion designers are lining up to dress the First Lady, after other designers had said they would not. Designer Stefano Gabbana,   of fashion house Dolce  Gabbana, has spent months posting photos on his Instagram of Mrs. Trump wearing clothes he designed. The photos caused controversy on social media, and Gabbana fired back at his critics who were threatening to boycott his designs. “How many stupid and ignorant people r on Instagram! !!” Gabbana wrote back in one of several comments taking aim at the negative posters. “Please if you don’t like my post unfollow me  …     thank you. ” In October, designer Calvin Klein said “of course” he would dress Melania Trump. “She’s beautiful,” Klein told TMZ.

21845,Report: Jared Kushner Hires Top Hollywood Publicist for White House Post,"President Donald Trump’s    and senior advisor Jared Kushner has reportedly hired top Hollywood public relations executive Josh Raffel to take a key role at the White House. [Raffel  —   the    communications chief for horror production company Blumhouse Productions (The Purge, Insidious) and a veteran of New York   PR firm Hiltzik Strategies  —   will reportedly join the White House Office of American Innovation, according to Variety.  The outlet notes that Raffel is   among entertainment industry journalists for his “sane, sensible style, and his wit. ” The Washington Post reported in March that Kushner had been tasked with overseeing the Office of American Innovation, a new White House office that will reportedly be focused on overhauling the federal bureaucracy by taking ideas from the business world and applying them to government. The office will reportedly be staffed by former business leaders and will report directly to President Trump. Among the notable names in the business world who have already participated in meetings are Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. “We should have excellence in government,” Kushner told the Post last month. “The government should be run like a great American company. Our hope is that we can achieve successes and efficiencies for our customers, who are the citizens. ” Raffel will reportedly move to Washington, D. C. to begin his new job in the coming weeks. He will be replaced at Blumhouse by former Universal Filmed Entertainment Group spokeswoman Teri Everett. Kushner has quietly become a major force in the Trump administration, as the president has entrusted the young advisor with duties ranging from negotiating a potential   peace deal to maintaining a healthy diplomatic relationship with Mexico.

21846,"Trump Won the Election, but 3 Manhattan Buildings Will Lose His Name - The New York Times","  Donald J. Trump will not be sworn in for two more months, but as of next week, the big gold letters spelling out his name will be removed from three large apartment buildings on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, tenants were told on Tuesday. Hundreds of tenants at the buildings at 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard, which contain a total of 1, 325 apartments, signed a petition to “Dump the TRUMP name,” last month after Mr. Trump’s provocative campaign statements had offended women, immigrants and liberals on the Upper West Side. The buildings, between 66th and 69th Streets, along Riverside Boulevard, are owned not by Mr. Trump but by Equity Residential, a publicly traded company based in Chicago, which bought them in 2005 for $809 million. Mr. Trump, a Republican, had been involved in the development known at various times as Riverside South and Trump Place. Equity Residential kept the name Trump Place on the exterior of the buildings and on their letterhead, signage and uniforms. Tenants got a hint that change was afoot in late October when doormen told residents that they were being measured for new uniforms that would no longer bear the Trump name. Then, on Tuesday, they received an email from Mary Pawlisa, a senior regional manager for Equity. It read: “This week, the Trump Place building names will change to the street addresses  —   140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard. The purpose of this change is to assume a neutral building identity that appeals to all current and future residents. ” Asked whether the      letters on the buildings had hurt the company’s ability to lease vacant apartments, Martin McKenna, Equity Residential’s vice president for investor and public relations, said: “I don’t have a comment on that. A more neutral identity going forward is the path we’re taking. ” Equity Residential’s portfolio consists of about 80, 000 apartments in New York, Boston, Seattle, Southern California and Washington  —   coincidentally all areas where Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, won a majority. Mr. McKenna preferred to describe those markets as “  gateway cities. ” Linda Gottlieb, a resident who started the petition, was elated. “We won,” Ms. Gottlieb, a film and television producer, said. “We used the power of protest to say that we don’t have to accept the spread of the man’s influence into our very homes. To me, it feels like a cleansing of the place where I live. ” But in an interview on Tuesday, Sam Zell, the chairman of Equity Residential, said, “The tenants had no role in this. ” Mr. Zell said he and “Don”  —   as he called Mr. Trump  —   had talked about it a year ago. “We didn’t want anything to happen while the election was going on,” he said. According to Mr. McKenna, Equity entered a “use of name contract” with the Trump Organization, which did not require it to pay Mr. Trump to use his name. That contract has now expired. Amanda Miller, vice president of marketing for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying the change “was mutually agreed upon. ”",0

The FBI will re-open its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, bureau director James Comey said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday.
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation … I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,” he wrote.

The language in the FBI letter to Congress makes it clear that new evidence has been discovered and will be reviewed — meaning FBI agents will read these emails.

21851,Swedish prosecutor sends Valerie Thighborg to London to summarize the Assange case,"Wednesday, 16 November 2016 Ms. Thighborg's presentation was interrupted due to problems with her accent 
A new update on the Assange case is again rising to the surface. Ms. Valerie Thighborg, who has visited Mr. Assange twice previously (reported in these pages) has returned to Ecuador's London embassy to review Mr. Assange's current interrogation. 
Accompanied by an additional special prosecutor in a black suit (known as Mr. Black), Miss Thighborg sat down with Mr. Assange and the Ecuadorian prosecutor to continue the current interviews. 
Ms. Thighborg apparently began ""Darleeng . . ."" but immediately changed that to ""Mr. Assange."" 
Witnesses indicated some problems with Ms. Thighborg's accent. 
Mr. Assange, however, seemed totally clear, slight smile on his pale features, pale hair somewhat disorderly. 
Ms. Thighborg's mistake in addressing Mr. Assange brought some murmuring in the room so that Mr. Black momentarily stood (hunched over) before resuming his seat at the table next to Ms. Thighborg. 
Ms. Thighborg then proceeded to address Mr. Assange with what sounded like: 
""Would you prefer I return this evening in my short white skirt which you love so much . . ."" bringing several witnesses at the hearing to their feet. 
Ms. Thighborg then clarified with: ""I meant to say would you prefer I return this evening with a short excursion clarifying why we insist you be held in this embassy under these conditions . . ."" (the last word sounding like ""condeeshuns""). 
Mr. Assange apparently mumbled for her to go ahead right then, somewhat lingering on the word ""ahead. "" (Analysts not sure of his meaning.) 
Ms. Thighborg immediately followed with a list of Mr. Assange's problems: 
*enemy of the ""Cleentun"" political party in the US due to Wikileaks exposures of the ""Cleentun FrownDation."" 
*enemy of Mr. Obama who ""please darleeng don't be ridiculous"" is so intent on ""being the how you say lame duck magneef-ee-sense, of course he won't pardon you . . ."" 
(At this point the hearing room at the embassy was even noisier, Mr. Black rising and sitting again, Mr. Assange still quietly pale.) 
*although no charges have been filed, and the case was dropped by the previous prosecutor to the current one, Ms. Ingrid Isren, ""Sweeden most co-op-er-ate weeth the politically correct Amurkian and Europeen community . . . "" 
*because most of the world wants to see you ""in jail cell, darleeng, or the dangle from Breetish lamp post . . ."" 
(Mr. Black had Ms. Thighborg by the elbow, urging her to rise, in order to remove her from the hearing, now in uproar.) 
A highly placed (but anonymous) spokesperson at the Embassy indicates Ms. Thighborg has not yet been escorted back to Sweden to face charges and imprisonment. 
She seeks Ecuador's protection at the London embassy to avoid extradition. 
Mr. Assange reports he has room in his small quarters to accommodate her, and ""Some company would be welcome."" Make joseph k winter's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0

[Officials say that an off duty Prince George’s County officer became suspicious of a vehicle and called the plates in over his radio, only to discover the vehicle was reported stolen in Vermont earlier in the day. The officer alerted authorities and a Charles County police officer spotted the   truck.  Police stopped the vehicle in a Walmart parking lot on January 25. Officers discovered    Malikah Saban Shabazz and    Bettih Bahiyah Shabazz inside the vehicle. Both were arrested, Fox 5 D. C. reported. What was inside the truck was unexpected. Investigators discovered seven pit bull terriers, some with injuries, stuffed into small cages inside the truck. As a result of the discovery, police charged the older of the two women with animal cruelty for the inhumane conditions inside the truck. Animal control officers removed the dogs and report they are in stable condition. Malikah Shabazz was charged with seven counts of animal cruelty and car theft. Bettih Bahiyah Shabazz was charged only with theft. The   old Malikah Shabazz is the daughter of assassinated Muslim activist Malcolm X, whose real name was Malcolm Little but later changed to Malik   when he converted to Islam. Bettih Bahiyah Shabazz, Malcolm X’s granddaughter, seems to have no fixed address. Malikah Shabazz has been in trouble with the law before. In 2011 she pleaded guilty to identity theft after amassing $55, 000 in debts under the name of the widow of one of Malcolm X’s past bodyguards. She was sentenced to probation in that case, the Associated Press reported. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0

21857,Get Over It,"Ready Nutrition October 27, 2016 
At our house, back to school means back to kids bringing home germs. When the leaves start turning, I start reaching for my cough drops, feeling that all too familiar tickle in my throat. If I can, I try to drink tons of water, wash my hands like crazy, and keep the bug from taking hold. But once I know I’m past the point of no return, the following things can help cut the duration of my cold and get me back to my busy life. 
Do you know how to tell the difference between a cold and a flu virus? 
Sleep Helps You Heal 
You probably know this already: one of you body’s first ways of signaling that all is not right internally is to make you very tired and sluggish. Don’t fight this feeling! Take a day or two off of work , if need be. Sleeping early and often during a cold can significantly cut the duration and intensity of a common cold. Sleeping allows your body to rest and recuperate—taking 10 hours of rest now could save you days down the line. Chances are you’ll pass out right away, but if you have trouble getting good sleep (particularly if your cold symptoms include coughing and congestion) put yourself in a dark, cool room with a white noise machine and a high-quality humidifier. 
Avoid catchall cold medications that are high in alcohol. Even though these drugs might seem like they’re helping you pass out, what you need is good quality, REM sleep. Alcohol can disrupt your natural, restorative sleep patterns and leave you feeling groggy. If you’re certain you need some assistance with sleeping, some people swear by melatonin as a natural sleep aid. 
Exercise (Even If You Don’t Feel Like It) 
So, you’ve succumbed to a cold, you’ve slept a solid 8 hours and you’re still feeling under the weather. You should definitely skip your workout today, right? Wrong! Even though the LAST thing you probably feel like doing is slogging through your exercise routine, you don’t want to flake out altogether. Movement and respiration actually speed up the healing process (doctors believe working out causes immune cells to respond to and attack viruses at a faster rate). But instead of doing your normal intensity workout, try doing light cardio such as walking or even speed walking. Listen to your body—if it feels like you can do more, push yourself a little. If you fell like you want to die, dial it back. And of course, it’s not polite to spread germs at the gym, so taking a walk outdoors or at least avoiding a community treadmill is much appreciated.",0

21862,"Posthoorn Interview no. 4: Tom 'Brexit prepper', the SAD truth","Topics: Scotland , Beer , Winter , The Netherlands , experiment , Brexit prepper Thursday, 27 October 2016 
Tom, from Scotland, has lived in The Netherlands since 1972 and has a Dutch wife. The reporter of the world famous weekly newspaper The Posthoorn (chosen by 75% of their readers as their favorite alternative cat litter) heard on the grapevine that Tom, the Netherlands' first Brexit prepper, was very sad. It was time to find out how bad sad Tom was. 
The reporter approaches the local pub of Tom. Ten flat beers are standing outside in the autumn sun, but Tom is nowhere to be seen. His wife is there with friends, waving her sixth Calvados: ""Sadly, he is not joining us today. He is somewhere inside, doing an experiment, ask the bar personnel."" Igo inside greeted by personnel who call me 'the cat litter reporter'. It seems Tom is in the beer cellar doing an experiment. How sad can you get? 
This reporter carefully goes down in the beer cellar, as it is very dark. A lonely candle shows Tom sitting on the floor having a beer. ""It is S.A.D."" he says sadly. Why is he so sad? ""Not sad, but S.A.D."" Tom says. ""It is 'Seasonal Affective Disorder'. I have to get used that in winter after 3.00 PM there is no daylight in Scotland. You know in your head it is midafternoon, but outside it is already very dark. You want to go home and watch the 9 o'clock news, but you still have 6 hours to go! Why the Dracula story was set in Transylvania beats me, he could have increased his evil doings between 3 AM and 9 PM tenfold and spent less time in his coffin here in Scotland. And what are the chances of garlic growing in these short days. Now I have to take vitamin D while I prefer vitamin B, if you know what I mean."" 
How is his course ''to Skype' going? Tom looks defiant: ""Not very good, I must admit. The first time I started up the app I thought it was an app for a mirror. Handy. I could see my nose hairs sticking out; I got the scissors out and clipped them. The next time I opened the app I could see my hair was too long, so I went to the hairdresser. It also shows up every wrinkle. I wonder is Skype sponsored by Botox? It depresses me. Maybe if I take my teeth out I will finally make a successful 'duck face', which seems to be de rigueur these days, for my profile photo."" 
The reporter invites Tom for a drink in the bar. A bit difficult as Tom takes a beer from outside and they are already paid for. ""Sometimes they steal one of my beers, how much worse can it get. I do not prep only for myself, but for all the Brexit preppers out there. The world is a darker place these days."" Make Marion Morris's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0

Theses guys are license zoo keepers ! #iloveanimals,” Epps wrote on Instagram. He later posted an apology note to his social media account, and said he would be donating to a kangaroo conservation charity.

Stacks told the gossip outlet that the animal was not harmed in any way during Friday night’s performance. However, according to a   report from the outlet, the U. S. Department of Agriculture is investigating the incident to determine whether the kangaroo handler was in control of the animal at all times, a requirement under the federal Animal Welfare Act.

Legendary Star Trek actor turned LGBT activist George Takei has been very vocal this election season. He joins much of America in being so utterly appalled by Republican nominee Donald Trump that he cannot stay silent as Trump unravels our democracy further and further with each passing day, and has a perfect response to those asking him to stop being so negative: People have asked me to tweet something positive about Trump. Okay, so be it: I am POSITIVE that Trump is a national disgrace. 
— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 28, 2016 
There is nothing positive to be said about Trump, except that the revelations of his long record of sexual assault is creating a national conversation about the abuse of women at the hands of powerful rich white men. 
Otherwise, Trump has been a walking manifestation of the ugliest parts of America, exposing our dirty laundry for all the world to see. Perhaps its what we needed to exorcise those demons – but it cannot be denied that it will take years to recover from the wounds this election has opened.",0

Luis Fedra y María Ramos, residentes en Vigo, han decidido renunciar a que sus tres hijos sean educados por la vía tradicional. “No queremos que vayan a la escuela, preferimos educarlos en Forocoches”, explica Luis. 
Los niños han dejado de ir a clases esta semana y ya tienen sus cuentas de usuario en este foro de Internet, que se encuentra entre las 40 webs más visitadas de España. “La universidad de la calle hoy en día es este foro: sus hilos de discusión recorren los temas más relevantes de la actualidad y de la sociedad de la España de hoy y de siempre”, defienden los padres. 
Según dicen, una criatura educada conjuntamente por la comunidad de Forocoches recibirá la formación necesaria “para vivir en un país como España, con todas sus particularidades”. La escuela, insisten, “crea una burbuja irreal y luego los críos crecen y no entienden nada de lo que ocurre en la vida real, en la calle”. 
“La Lei de Apoio á Familia fomenta el vacío legal del estudio alternativo”, reconoce un portavoz de la Xunta de Galicia, que pasa la pelota al Ministerio de Educación. Mientras la discusión se atranque en disputas administrativas, Luis y María se encargarán de que sus tres retoños lean y estudien temas de Forocoches como “Ford Fiesta síntomas raros”, “Los mejores chicles del siglo” o “Que te la chupen con aparatos sí o no???”.

21876,"PICTURES – Trump Visits Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem - Breitbart","JERUSALEM  —   President Donald Trump on Monday visited the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem as part of his   tour here in Israel. [The church, believed to be the place of Jesus’s crucifixion, burial and resurrection, is one of the holiest sites in Christianity. Trump met outside the church with leaders of local Christian denominations before going inside for a private tour closed to the news media.  Afterwards, Trump went to the nearby Western Wall where he became the first sitting U. S. president to visit the Jewish holy site. The Western Wall is part of an ancient retaining wall erected around the Jewish Temple.  The Temple Mount, site of the first and second Jewish Temples, is considered the holiest site in Judaism.        Trump toured the holy sites after a red carpet ceremony at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv and a meeting with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin at the president’s residence in Jerusalem. Trump is headed next to a private social dinner with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Tuesday, Trump’s schedule includes a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem and then a   ceremony at Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.  Trump will then give a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem before departing the country for the Vatican. Trump is here in Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day, a national holiday that marks Israel’s reunification of Jerusalem after the 1967 Six Day War and the establishment of Israeli sovereignty over the eastern sections of the city, which include the Old City, Western Wall and Temple Mount. Many will be watching to see if Trump uses the visit to announce that he is moving the U. S. embassy from the beach in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although reports put that as unlikely. Israel officially annexed Jerusalem in 1980 in a move not recognized by the international community because the Palestinians claim eastern sections of the city for a future Palestinian capital despite their never having had a state or entity in those areas. Current U. S. law does not officially recognize Israeli control over the eastern sections of the city, going so far as to prevent American citizens born in Jerusalem from listing “Israel” as their country of birth. All eyes will be on Trump to see if he makes any declarations regarding Israel’s status in Jerusalem. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

21877,Anonymous Bomb Threats Rattle Jewish Centers Across Eastern U.S. - The New York Times,"The morning rush at the Jewish community center in Columbia, S. C. had subsided when the phone rang on Monday. The caller, an   woman, “in a loud screaming voice kept saying there’s a bomb,” said Barry A. Abels, the center’s executive director. At roughly the same time, a woman dialed the Jewish community center in Rockville, Md. nearly 500 miles away, and said there was a bomb. Not long after, a man called a Jewish organization in Wilmington, Del. He, too, warned of a bomb. Similar threats, which turned out to be unfounded, were reported all over the Eastern United States on Monday, at as many as 16 Jewish community facilities, one advocacy group estimated. Time and time again, the police responded, buildings were evacuated and, after tense waits, the centers and schools reopened. Federal law enforcement officials did not definitively link the threats, but the episodes rattled nerves, and raised deep concern and little doubt that the phone calls had been orchestrated. “My personal take is it’s a statement of where we are in this country,” said Michael Feinstein, the chief executive of the Bender Jewish Community Center of Greater Washington, in Rockville. “There’s some thought amongst some people that hate speech and hate crimes are O. K. and   is O. K. and I think that is reflective of sort of the political discourse that we’ve had in this country. ” Mr. Feinstein said about 300 people had been in the Rockville center when the threat was made, including about 200 preschoolers. After the threat in Delaware, parents were called to pick up preschool and day school students. In South Carolina, Mr. Abels said staff members and patrons attending exercise classes had to leave. About three hours later, he said, the authorities said it was safe to return, leaving many to wonder what had happened. “It could be anything from hate groups to a terrorist situation,” Mr. Abels said. “I think it’s probably more on the hate group side, because it was just a scare. ” He said he believed it was “designed to be psychologically disorienting and scary and just disruptive. ” Jerry Silverman, the president and chief executive of the Jewish Federations of North America, said the threats were part of a disturbing trend toward normalizing hate speech. It was less than three years ago that a former Ku Klux Klan leader killed three people outside Jewish facilities in Overland Park, Kan. And in November, after the presidential election, the   League posted a warning about a reported uptick in hate speech and  . Some members of the   a   fringe movement that embraces elements of   racist and   positions, perceived the victory of   Donald J. Trump as validation for their cause and have become increasingly visible in recent months. Mr. Trump, who has a Jewish daughter and    has disavowed the  . Mr. Silverman said Monday’s cases were part of a broader “coordinated effort” to intimidate Jews. He said that Jewish organizations nationwide had instituted emergency protocols, and that leaders were communicating with one another on Monday as the threats were reported. “We’ve seen this at Jewish community centers over the last year,” Mr. Silverman said. “We’ve seen it at Jewish day schools. We’ve seen it at synagogues. ” “It’s all about training and preparedness,” he added. Law enforcement agencies in Nashville Jacksonville, Fla. and Tenafly, N. J. were among those confirming on Monday that they had responded to and cleared bomb threats at Jewish centers. An F. B. I. spokeswoman said the bureau was “aware of bomb threats” and had been in touch with the local police. “We understand there were similar threats around the country,” said Tzipora Cohen, of the Jewish Community Center in Tenafly. “I guess these are the times we live in. ”",0

21879,German Ministry Wants Migrants Returned to Africa: Report,"German Ministry Wants Migrants Returned to Africa: Report Reuters, November 6, 2016 
The German Interior Ministry wants to stop migrants ever reaching Europe’s Mediterranean coast by picking them up at sea and returning them to Africa, the Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported on Sunday. 
In what would be a huge shift for a country with one of the most generous asylum policies, the ministry says the European Union should adopt an Australian-style system under which migrants intercepted at sea are sent for processing at camps in third countries. 
“The elimination of the prospect of reaching the European coast could convince migrants to avoid embarking on the life-threatening and costly journey in the first place,” the paper quoted a ministry spokeswoman as saying. 
“The goal must be to remove the basis for people-smuggling organizations and to save migrants from the life-threatening journey.” 
The ministry’s proposal calls for migrants picked up in the Mediterranean–most of whom set off from conflict-torn Libya–to be sent to Tunisia, Egypt or other north African states to apply for asylum from there. 
If their asylum applications are accepted, the migrants could then be transported safely to Europe.

21880,Report: Pro-Common Core Jeb Bush Former Staffer No Longer Candidate for Assistant U.S. Education Secretary,"The   Core New Mexico education secretary who once served as a staffer in former Gov. Jeb Bush’s administration in Florida is no longer a candidate for assistant secretary of the U. S. Education Department, reports Politico. [Hanna Skandera’s name was pulled from consideration for the position, the report says, because about a dozen Senate Republicans “were skeptical that they could ever vote yes” to confirm her, due to her support for the highly unpopular Common Core standards.  Skandera was deputy education commissioner under Jeb Bush and also a senior policy adviser and deputy chief of staff at the education department under former U. S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, who served under President George W. Bush. Like Jeb Bush, Skandera is a proponent of the Common Core standards. She is head of the governing board of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) one of the two federally funded test consortia that developed assessments aligned with Common Core. President Donald Trump campaigned on getting rid of the Common Core standards, and a   network of grassroots citizens across the country are vehemently opposed to the federalized program that was introduced in President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill. Emmett McGroarty, a senior fellow at American Principles Project, released the following statement: We applaud the Administration and the Senate for scuttling the nomination of Hanna Skandera due to her past support for Common Core standards and testing. Parents, students, and teachers detest Common Core because it locks children into an inferior education. As President Trump has said, Common Core “is a total disaster. ” We urge the Administration to look for appointees committed to achieving the President’s vision that “education has to be at a local level. We cannot have the bureaucrats in Washington telling you how to manage your child’s education. ” Though U. S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has funded and served organizations that promote Common Core  —   including Jeb Bush’s Foundation for Excellence in Education  —   since her nomination, she has denied she supports the controversial standards. DeVos, nevertheless, has surrounded herself with advisers and staff who have ties to Bush’s foundation, as well as to Indiana, where Common Core was repealed, but then simply “rebranded. ” The secretary recently said the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) “essentially does away with the notion of a Common Core,” a statement many grassroots parent activists still battling against the Core in their states have rejected. Upon DeVos’s nomination, KOB4 in Albuquerque reported Skandera praised Trump’s pick, saying that while she did not know her well, she believed DeVos’s policies would not change Common Core in New Mexico. Breitbart News reached out to the press office at the U. S. Education Department to confirm the report but received no response.",0

The Daily Mail has been forced to go and lie down in a darkened room for a while after learning that Prince Harry’s new girlfriend is one of those ‘brown ones’. 
Doctors were called after the newspaper reported feeling faint at reading the Kensington Palace statement confirming the relationship. 
The Daily Mail explained, “I know we’ve been reporting the relationship for days, but we’d hoped against hope it wasn’t really true. 
“Sure, we’ve trawled her entire career and social feeds going back years to find video clips and photos that might make her look unsuitable as a girlfriend for a member of our royal family, all without ever saying it’s just because she’s a brown foreigner – but you kinda knew that, right? 
“I mean, we can’t just say we don’t like her because she’s brown and foreign. Otherwise, we’d probably find our editor Paul Dacre being reported to himself in his other role at the Press Complaints Commission. That wouldn’t be good for anyone. 
“But now it’s bloody well confirmed she’s definitely going out with him, and.. well… oh hear, I’m coming over all faint again. 
“Do you realise that any child they might have would be 6th in line to the throne?! Can you imagine, a BROWN king!!”

21884,Palestinian UN Envoy Threatens Donald Trump If He Keeps Promise To Move Embassy To Jerusalem,"  Palestinian UN Envoy Threatens Donald Trump If He Keeps Promise To Move Embassy To Jerusalem The Palestinian ambassador to the UN on Friday warned President-elect Donald Trump that if he dares to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, the Palestinians would “make life miserable” for the United States at the United Nations.   14, 2016 The Palestinian ambassador to the UN on Friday warned President-elect Donald Trump that if he dares to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, the Palestinians would “make life miserable” for the United States at the United Nations. 
“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.” Zechariah 12:2 (KJV) 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Donald Trump’s campaign promise to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is t he whole reason why I supported him in the first place. From a Bible prophecy perspective the implications and ramifications of such a move are off the charts. We warned from the very start that this move could easily trigger the Psalm 83 War. And right on cue, here comes the Palestinians protesting it already. Things are about to get very, very interesting…to say the least. 
“If people attack us by moving the embassy to Jerusalem, which is a violation of Security Council resolutions, it is a violation of Resolution 181 of the UN general assembly that was drafted by the U.S. … it means they are showing belligerency towards us. … If they do that nobody should blame us for unleashing all of the weapons that we have in the UN to defend ourselves and we have a lot of weapons in the UN,” Riyad Mansour said . 
Mansour conceded that such a move could not be passed as a Security Council resolution because of the U.S. veto. Nevertheless, he warned Trump, “Maybe I can’t have resolutions in the Security Council but I can make their lives miserable everyday with precipitating a veto on my admission as a member state.” 
Mansour warned that he would “reopen the whole Pandora’s Box” of verdicts in the International Criminal Court of Justice on the issue of Israel’s security fence and the settlements. 
He added that “it is illegal to defy Security Council resolutions that the U.S. is party to that the unilateral action by Israel annexing East Jerusalem is illegal and it is null and void. If the U.S. administration wants to defy international law they are doing something illegal.”  ",0

21886,Report: Donald Trump Will Exit Paris Climate Change Agreement,"President Donald Trump has decided to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, according to a report from Axios reporter Jonathan Swan citing two sources with knowledge of the decision. [The news was confirmed by several mainstream media outlets.  On Twitter, Trump indicated that an announcement was coming soon. “I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days,” he wrote. “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” The decision wreaks havoc on former President Barack Obama’s legacy as president, despite pleas from world leaders for the United States to show leadership on climate change and remain in the agreement, Trump’s decision fulfills a key campaign promise to supporters of his run for president, widely supported by Republican members of congress who felt that the treaty unfairly jeopardized the American economy. Opponents of the climate deal were concerned after White House economic advisor Gary Cohn told reporters that the president was “evolving on the issue” during his trip overseas. His daughter Ivanka and    Jared Kushner reportedly channelled support for the deal behind the scenes at the White House, encouraging climate change activists that Trump might change his mind. Trump’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon CEO, also supported remaining in the treaty. On May 9th, Obama defended his climate change legacy, calling the agreement “the one that will define the contours of this century more dramatically perhaps than any other. ” In October 2016, Obama described the deal as “the best possible shot to save the one planet we’ve got. ” New York and Washington elites agreed, downplaying the future of coal as an energy source and urging more federal subsidies for wind and solar investments. Trump’s EPA Secretary Scott Pruitt and White House senior advisor Stephen K. Bannon urged the president to keep his campaign promise to kill the agreement and put American energy and job growth first.  ",0
21888,Fukushima Radiation Has Contaminated The Entire Pacific Ocean – And It’s Going To Get Worse,"posted by Eddie The nuclear disaster has contaminated the world’s largest ocean in only five years and it’s still leaking 300 tons of radioactive waste every day. What was the most dangerous nuclear disaster in world history? Most people would say the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, but they’d be wrong. In 2011, an earthquake, believed to be an aftershock of the 2010 earthquake in Chile, created a tsunami that caused a meltdown at the TEPCO nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan. Three nuclear reactors melted down and what happened next was the largest release of radiation into the water in the history of the world. Over the next three months, radioactive chemicals, some in even greater quantities than Chernobyl , leaked into the Pacific Ocean. However, the numbers may actually be much higher as Japanese official estimates have been proven by several scientists to be flawed in recent years. If that weren’t bad enough, Fukushima continues to leak an astounding 300 tons of radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean every day . It will continue do so indefinitely as the source of the leak cannot be sealed as it is inaccessible to both humans and robots due to extremely high temperatures. It should come as no surprise, then, that Fukushima has contaminated the entire Pacific Ocean in just five years. This could easily be the worst environmental disaster in human history and it is almost never talked about by politicians, establishment scientists, or the news. It is interesting to note that TEPCO is a subsidiary of General Electric (also known as GE), one of the largest companies in the world, which has considerable control over numerous news corporations and politicians alike. Could this possibly explain the lack of news coverage Fukushima has received in the last five years? There is also evidence that GE knew about the poor condition of the Fukushima reactors for decades and did nothing. This led 1,400 Japanese citizens to sue GE for their role in the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Even if we can’t see the radiation itself, some parts of North America’s western coast have been feeling the effects for years. Not long after Fukushima, fish in Canada began bleeding from their gills, mouths, and eyeballs. This “disease” has been ignored by the government and has decimated native fish populations, including the North Pacific herring. Elsewhere in Western Canada, independent scientists have measured a 300% increase in the level of radiation. According to them, the amount of radiation in the Pacific Ocean is increasing every year. Why is this being ignored by the mainstream media? It might have something to do with the fact that the US and Canadian governments have banned their citizens from talking about Fukushima so “people don’t panic.” 
Further south in Oregon, USA, starfish began losing legs and then disintegrating entirely when Fukushima radiation arrived there in 2013. Now, they are dying in record amounts, putting the entire oceanic ecosystem in that area at risk. However, government officials say Fukushima is not to blame even though radiation in Oregon tuna tripled after Fukushima . In 2014, radiation on California beaches increased by 500 percent. In response, government officials said that the radiation was coming from a mysterious “unknown” source and was nothing to worry about. 
However, Fukushima is having a bigger impact than just the West coast of North America. Scientists are now saying that the Pacific Ocean is already radioactive and is currently at least 5-10 times more radioactive than when the US government dropped numerous nuclear bombs in the Pacific during and after World War II. If we don’t start talking about Fukushima soon, we could all be in for a very unpleasant surprise.

21891,Ambush Kills 8 Police Officers in Egypt - The New York Times,"CAIRO  —   Unidentified gunmen sprayed bullets on a police minibus as it passed through a Cairo district early on Sunday, killing eight plainclothes officers in an ambush that was later claimed by the Islamic State. It was the deadliest attack on Egypt’s security forces in the capital in months, and a sharp reminder of the continuing threat from Islamist insurgents while President Abdel Fattah   is under increasing scrutiny for his harsh crackdown on political dissent. Although the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility could not be independently verified, its format and language were consistent with earlier statements from the group. The Islamic State also claims to have downed a Russian passenger jet that crashed into the Sinai Desert in October, killing 224 people. The Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement that four assailants had fired on the unmarked police minibus as it passed through Helwan, an industrial center on the southern edge of greater Cairo. The police officers were on routine security duties, the ministry said. Images on social media showed the bloodied bodies of the officers, dressed in shirts and jeans, slumped in and around a white vehicle that was raked with bullet holes. In a statement circulated on social media, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, said that “soldiers of the caliphate” had carried out the attack in retaliation for the imprisonment of “pure women” in Egyptian jails  —   a common justification for violence by Egyptian militants. The group identified one of the dead officers and said the attackers had taken guns from the police before escaping unhindered. Hours later, Egyptian security officials said they had tracked the assailants to a hilly area on the edge of Helwan, which they said had been sealed off as they conducted a search. Islamist insurgents based in Sinai have been fighting the Egyptian government for years, but the scale and frequency of attacks increased after the military ousted the elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, in July 2013. Fighting has been mostly confined to Sinai, where the Egyptian military has a heavy presence and which is mostly sealed off to the news media. But violence has occasionally spilled over into Cairo, usually in gun attacks and small bombings. In November, four police officers at a checkpoint in Cairo were killed in a gun attack that was also claimed by the Islamic State. By lunchtime on Sunday, a funeral was underway for the slain officers, who were honored with   coffins at a service attended by the interior minister, Maj. Gen. Magdi   and a row of   police commanders. Fears over the spread of the Islamic State, which is based in Syria and Iraq but also has a muscular presence in Libya, have helped ensure Western support for Mr. Sisi even as he faces renewed criticism for a harsh,   crackdown on political dissent in Egypt. More than 1, 200 people were arrested last month after public protests over the transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. Almost 600 of them have been formally charged, according to rights groups. Mr. Sisi’s popularity has also been damaged by public anger at repeated episodes of police brutality, often over trivial matters, that have resulted in the deaths of ordinary citizens. Spontaneous street protests erupted twice in recent months after officers shot and killed people in separate arguments over a taxi fare and a cup of tea. The Interior Ministry, which controls the police, was criticized by Egypt’s only media union after two journalists were arrested during a police raid on the union’s headquarters on May 1. The furor over the arrests, which built steadily during the week, was to be debated in the Egyptian Parliament on Sunday, the state Al Ahram newspaper reported on its website. Most newspapers did not publish blackened front pages on Sunday to protest the arrests, as the union had said they would.",0

21895,Federation of Greek Women: statement on the visit of Obama,"November 20, 2016 - Fort Russ News - 

-  902.gr , translated by Tom Winter - 


""Behind the fiestas and the photo ops, Mr Obama, you came unwanted and you left unwanted"" said the statement of the Federation of Greek Women on the visit of the US President. The statement criticizes the fact that Barack Obama ""pronounced benedictions to our ""left"" prime minister for ""reforms that bled the Greek people"" and notes that ""the US has a major share of responsibility for the massacre, not only of our own people, but also the peoples of the world."" Details of the Communication: Mr. Obama came to Greece reading beautiful words ... He came equipped with ""mirrors for the natives"" with shameless and cheap flattery for the sacrifices of the Greek people and with an Ode to Democracy 'made in Greece' dripping from his lips. The outgoing US president had good words for our ""left"" prime minister for the ""reforms"" that bled the Greek people, apparently recognizing in Mr. Tsipras a kindred spirit (albeit at a lower level). He certainly avoided telling us that the ""democracy,"" he so often mentioned has proved most convenient for exploiters of our toil.  It is the ""democracy"" soaked through in child poverty and misery.  It is the ""democracy"" of refugees and wars, the ""democracy"" of imperialist interventions from Ukraine to the Middle East and Africa.  It is the ""democracy"" of the employers' terrorism, labor flexibility, one job for each two and three employees.  It is the ""democracy"" that has many living on crumbs or the soup kitchens, while a trillion. euro of capital is concentrated in Greece on our slaving, and still looking to find where to invest to give more profits to monopoly groups.   It is the ""democracy"" that supports an alliance of wolves and a mutual extermination system.  This is the ""democracy"" concealed in the pat words of Mr. Obama And, of course, he shoved under the carpet what the Greek people know well, but that our Greek Prime Minister preferred to ""forget:"" that the US has a major share of responsibility for the massacre, not only of our own people, but also people of all the world, rapidly now extending to every corner of the globe.  No family woman should fall into their snare! We, the women of the radical women's movement do not want, and can not be fooled by, the supposed gifts that the former ""President of the World"" came to offer us. We are the first to know that the famous egalitarianism of ""democracy"" he praised us for does not mean equality of standing! Instead, it is the most deceptive wrapping of our occupational and social inequity. We, the women of daily toil not accept the lure of supposedly ""democratic"" and ""peaceful"" declarations serving only the imperialist plans in our region and creating an immediate danger to our lives and future. We, the women who participate in associations and groups of IAHS have had enough fine words from wherever they come from.   We will not succumb to the deadly lullaby of false hope and insidious complacency. We constantly exhibit with our participation in the daily struggle our desire for a life without exploitation and oppression, without wars, and without their attendant refugees.

21898,Professor Wants Children to Learn ’Queer Theory’ in Elementary School - Breitbart,"A professor at the University of Arizona who conducts research on science education is arguing that students should be taught “queer theory” in elementary school. [Kristin Gunckel, a professor at the University of Arizona, argued on behalf of introducing “queer theory” into American elementary school curriculum in a recent lecture that took place last month.  “Queer theory,” according to Gunckel, examines why heterosexuality is portrayed as the “only normal and natural form” for human beings. “It challenges categorical thinking and specifically aims to disrupt the   binary,” she wrote. “Queer theory examines how the social construction of sexuality is normalized so that heterosexuality is portrayed as the only normal and natural form of being human. ” “Queering science education means exploding binary gender and sexuality constructions, collapsing heteronormativity, and opening spaces within science education for the marginalized identities,” she adds. Heteronormativity is defined as “denoting or relating to a world view that promotes heterosexuality as the normal or preferred sexual orientation. In an academic research paper, Gunckel wrote that “school science plays a strong role in silencing queer identities and limiting science knowledge and learning. ” “In elementary school, it means not hiding sexuality from children. At all levels, it means providing space within the curriculum for students to see themselves and their families. Queering science education means making the invisible visible,” Gunckel wrote.

21899,Links 11/12/16,"What Does Trump’s Victory Mean For NATO? NPR. Charles flags the close, which is an unusually pointed admission of the basis of our imperialist project. 
Brexit 
Turkey is swiftly heading towards a regime of terror Bangkok Post (furzy) 
Trump Transition. I am trying, and hope you will help in comments, in pulling the noise out of the signal regarding what Trump will actually do when he becomes President and whether it will succeed, “success” consisting first of it being implemented and second, making him and his Administration appear to be legitimate (as in keeping campaign promises, delivering tangible benefits to voters or powerful interest groups he needs on board). Despite all the changes in messaging over the course of his campaign, Trump was consistent on immigration, trade and lack of infrastructure investment, and depicted all three as ways to improve conditions for workers. And political scientist Tom Ferguson says that the data shows that the propensity to vote for Trump was highly correlated with voters giving negative answers to questions like whether the economy or the job situation had gotten better. 
Trump and Sanders found power lying in the street by virtue of both parities abandoning high employment levels and wage growth as major policy goals. But if Trump is to deliver on his promise of delivering on those goals, he is at odds with much of his own party, which is keen to keep workers weak and preserve free trade (the corporate Republicans, particularly ones whose constituents include globalized businesses like autos, for the obvious patronage reasons; libertarians, out of ideology). Given that trade policy and immigration enforcement are areas in which the President has considerable latitude, whether and how he engages in these fights will be early tests of whether he intends to and is able to execute. 
Finally bear in mind that Trump not only has a thin bench staff wise, but also intellectually. Many of his sources of advice are ideologues who like the Brexiters in the UK, may cheerily recommend changes which might sound ducky (to them) without having the foggiest clue that the operational implications are nightmarish. For instance, I’m told the Trump transition team on policy is apparently planning on recommending that the US exit Nafta and the WTO on the first day of the Trump presidency. Pray tell, have they looked into what this means for US customs, and for US exporters dealing with foreign customs? 
In other words, the right wing think tank types that the Trump team is relying on runs the risk of being as clueless about issues of organizational capacity as the Greeks were who thought they had a trump card (pun intended) in a Grexit (for those new to Naked Capitalism, we had an extensive series of posts on this topic, see here , here and here for some examples). 
So for instance, see this BBC story: 
Trump likes main Obamacare provisions ‘very much’ , specifically, covering pre-existing conditions and letting children up to age 26. The story describes how the Republicans might oppose Trump: 
Complicating the matter is that a “revise and reform” effort may not fly with Mr Trump’s ardent supporters and the cadre of arch-conservative politicians in Congress, who want to tear up the law “root and branch”. 
Mr Trump often broke with Republican orthodoxy while campaigning and didn’t pay a political price. He may learn that as president he won’t get far without his party establishment’s help. 
In WSJ Interview, Trump Says He Is Willing to Keep Parts of Health Law Wall Street Journal. Note the heavy emphasis on job creation. This had been the Democratic party lode star through the Carter era. He also defines Pence’s job, which is to help on health care and sell Trump policies to Congress. This is similar to the role Joe Biden played. And he rejected the Administration “find those moderate Syrians” strategy.",0
21900,"Suspect in Istanbul Rampage on New Year’s Is Captured, Turkey Says - The New York Times","The police in Turkey have arrested the man accused of carrying out a deadly attack on an Istanbul nightclub early on New Year’s Day, killing 39 people, including a police officer and 25 foreigners, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency as well as Turkish news reports. The news agency said that a police raid on a residence in the outlying Esenyurt district of Istanbul had resulted in the capture of Abdulgadir Masharipov, whom the authorities described as an Islamic State militant of Uzbek nationality, along with four other people. The others were a man of Kyrgyz nationality and three women, whose nationalities were not given, Anadolu said. Turkish news organizations posted photographs of the suspect in custody, showing him bruised and with fresh blood on his clothing and face. He had reportedly been injured while carrying out the deadly attack on the Reina nightclub on the Bosporus. An estimated 69 people were wounded by the attacker, who went on a shooting rampage with a   rifle inside the crowded and popular venue. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack the next day and said in a statement that it had been carried out “in continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey, the protector of the cross. ” The Turkish authorities quickly identified the suspect from   television, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to bring him to justice. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, posted a Twitter message congratulating the country’s interior minister on the arrest. “In the name of our nation, I thank primarily our minister, Suleyman Soylu, our police and intelligence organizations who captured Reina assailant,” he wrote. The district where the suspect was captured, Esenyurt, on the European side of Istanbul, is a former slum that has been rapidly redeveloped with new apartment blocks housing many refugees and migrants. Turkish news reports said Mr. Masharipov was with his    son when he was captured, and news video showed one of the suspects being attacked at the arrest scene. The suspect identified as a Kyrgyz national was seen lying handcuffed on the ground, with a police officer’s boot holding his head down.",0

In the absence of intervention, gold and silver would be trading at a level that is a few multiples higher from they “trade” now. At some point, some entity will want to take possession of a big “chunk” of gold or silver and will stand for delivery of the physical with the intent to remove that gold or silver from Comex vaults.

There is always the threat that the Shanghai Gold Exchange begins arbitraging out the price difference between the physical market (eastern hemisphere) and paper market (Comex, LBMA). Currentlysilver trades in China’s physical settlement market (Shanghai Futures Exchange) at a significant premium to the price on the COMEX paper market. The week of October 17, 2016 the average difference was well above $0.80 per ounce. This represents approximately a 45% difference. 
How large must the difference become before the physical market naturally overwhelms the paper market? The difference in the physical gold market is not quiet as dramatic as the physical silver market, but it seems a natural progression will occur in the not too distant future. 
The physical market is filled with people that are not interested in paper contracts. These people are in real markets located in the eastern hemisphere – China, India and other countries. In these countries gold is either part of the culture or there is an understanding of gold’s role as a currency.

21904,Justice Department Releases Guidelines on Controversial Anti-Hacking Law,"Justice Department Releases Guidelines on Controversial Anti-Hacking Law There have been several unsuccessful attempts to reform the law in recent years Image Credits: flickr, skippy . 
TO MANY WHO conduct work or research related to digital security, the legislation meant to protect against computer crimes has morphed into something harmful. The 1986 law, the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, has been repeatedly described as vague and ineffectual — allowing overzealous prosecutors to saddle hacktivists and low-level criminals with excessive sentences. 
Now, thanks to a legal challenge to the CFAA, the Department of Justice is for the first time releasing its 2014 guidelines on how prosecutors should charge computer crimes — when someone exceeds “authorized” access on a computer. (First Look Media, the publisher of The Intercept, is a plaintiff in the case.) 
The Department of Justice acknowledges that “laws addressing the misuse of computers have not kept pace uniformly with developments in technology and criminal schemes” though it maintains that the law remains “important” in prosecuting cybercrimes. 
Some of the prosecutions under the CFAA have proved controversial. Aaron Swartz, a well-known internet activist who downloaded academic journals en masse, faced years of grueling legal trials under the CFAA before he committed suicide. And Andrew Auernheimer was found guilty of conspiracy to violate the CFAA by uncovering AT&T customer data exposed on the company website.",0
21905,Detect Negative Energies And Malicious Entities Haunting You With A Glass Of Water,"Maintaining an overall positive energy in ones home is vital for ensuring all members of the family are happy and healthy at all times. The presence of negative energy can quickly cause tensions and arguments. There are many different ways that have been written about to attempt to detect and eliminate these elusive negative energies, many are complicated, but one method simply involves using a glass of water.


A Glass of Water Can Detect Negative Energy In Your House 

Water is a useful tool in this context because it relates to the way in which people absorb energy, both negative and positive. Every action in a person's life, as well as their interactions with others, has an effect on their energy and all these pieces combine to determine one's overall mood and how content they are. Negative energies have been linked to a range of mood disorders such as anxiety and depression that can quickly have a destructive impact on day to day life, so it is important to investigate and resolve the source of the negativity as quickly as possible . 

It can sometimes be difficult to identify this source so it can be useful to have an arsenal of tricks to locate where the negative energy is emulating from. Vinegar, salt, and water are required as well as a large cup to mix them in. In equal parts (so 1/3 of the cup each) add the ingredients to the cup and mix well using a metal spoon or something similar. If one area of the building had been particularly eery or suspicious then, the glass should be placed in this location and covered with glad wrap. After leaving for at least 24 hours, it can be inspected to see if any signs of negative energy have been recorded. Marks on the outside of the glass or changes to the appearance of the liquid are examples, but any change to the glass or liquid is a good indicator that negative energy is emitting from nearby.

It’s so much fun to watch as various right-wing morons and evangelical Christians attempt rationalize and even excuse the words and behavior of Donald Trump, who freely admitted that he enjoys sexually assaulting women by kissing them and grabbing their crotches against their will. Had a Democratic candidate done the same, they would be standing atop every high hill they could find and shouting that it was the end of the world and human morality. 
Now we have wackobird conspiracy theorist Wayne Allyn Root weighing in on the matter, and the reason he gives Trump a pass on the sexual assault is because he says there’s just no way it could have happened because Trump is too handsome to have committed such an act. 
Appearing on the “The Real Side” radio show, Root laid out this line of bullcrap : “If you’re a Christian, you just can’t spend your life worrying about the words of Donald Trump from 11 years ago or what women he groped 30 years ago. I don’t believe any of it anyway. I believe Donald Trump is one of the handsomest billionaires that’s ever lived; I don’t think he ever had to grope a single woman ever. I think they threw themselves at him, so it’s all a lie.” 
Yeah, because a handsome man would never ever force himself on a woman. Are you kidding me?! Root then went on to add : “The man isn’t a perfect Christian, but he’s the perfect guy sent from God and from central casting to be the vicious guy we needed to save America, save capitalism, fight the Clinton crime cartel and save Christianity from these vicious, vicious people. They’re terrible, dirty people and a nice guy could have never won this war. Only a dirty player could win the war, so I think Donald’s the perfect guy, sent by God to fill the perfect role and save us all.” 
There actually are no perfect Christians; that’s kinda the point of that whole Jesus died for your sins thing, Wayne. And if you think a person as vile and perverted as Donald Trump was sent by God, then clearly you don’t know this line from the Bible: “And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.” ( Matthew 19:24 ) 
Here’s Root proving his own ignorance:

21911,Officials in Saudi Media: Trump Visit ’Essential to Our National Security’ - Breitbart,"Officials and diplomats have heralded President Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia as proof that he has committed to working with Muslim countries to promote stability in the Middle East, particularly regarding Iran’s aggression in the region, according to the Saudi publication the Arab News. [“President Trump’s visit to the Kingdom is very important in the shared goal and efforts to fight terrorism and bring safety and stability in the Middle East,” Mona Almushait, a member of Saudi Arabia’s Shoura Council said.  “Trump’s meetings in Riyadh are essential to our national security and to the global stability, particularly because there will be discussions on measures to take to confront the Iranian aggression,” she said, noting that Trump is the first U. S. president to make Saudi Arabia his first international destination. “Trump’s visit is very important for the security architecture in the region, and underlines the pivotal role the Kingdom is playing in the region,” German Ambassador Dieter W. Haller also told the publication. “I understand that the fight against terrorism and extremism will be the main focus of the visit and this is very good news,” Haller said. “We can only fight terrorism successfully if we all  —   Arabs, Muslims and   Europeans, Americans  —   stand together. ” “I hope the very significant meetings President Trump will have in Riyadh will create the foundation for a better mutual understanding for all involved and for a stronger action in confronting the common challenges, including terrorism and regional instability,” Portuguese Ambassador Manuel Carvalho added in an interview with the newspaper.. In the early months of his administration, Trump has already held    meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   and King Abdullah II of Jordan. The Foreign Policy Group reported in April: The contrast between the treatment of Egypt by the Trump and Obama administrations could not be more stark. Whereas President Barack Obama and his team did not hesitate to welcome the Muslim Brotherhood’s takeover of Egypt, while summarily dismissing former President Hosni Mubarak, the current administration is debating whether to go so far as to label the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. President Trump spoke on Tuesday night with King Abdullah II of Jordan, as part of his strategy to strengthen relationships with leaders of Muslim countries ahead of his Middle East visit, the Washington Times reported. In the phone call, Trump and King Abdullah reportedly reaffirmed the need for U. S.  coordination in   operations generally, the effort to end the civil war in Syria, and the shared fight against the Islamic State, the White House said. During the presidential campaign Trump spoke out about the nuclear agreement with Iran that former President Barack Obama helped broker as a “terrible” deal and last month ordered a review of it. “Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror, through many platforms and methods,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. “President Donald J. Trump has directed a National Security   interagency review of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that will evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA is vital to the national security interests of the United States. ” Trump will also visit Israel and Vatican City, where he will meet with Pope Francis. The President is also scheduled to meet with NATO officials in Brussels and with   leaders meeting in Sicily.",0

Orange County, FL — Deputy Tracy Weiss was off-duty last month when she noticed that her illegally parked truck was being towed. The way she acted next could have landed a normal person in jail. However, because Weiss is a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff’s department, that will likely not happen. 
When Weiss noticed that her truck was being towed, she jumped into another vehicle and then drove the wrong way down a one-way street to block the driver in who had towed her car. 
When she exits the vehicle, according to the tow truck driver, she had her gun drawn. When he saw the gun, the driver pulled out his camera phone and began to record. 
“I’m a cop. Drop my truck,” yelled Weiss. 
“You need to put your gun away,” replied the driver. 
“You see a gun?” Weiss asked, acting as if she didn’t have one once she saw the camera. 
“Yes. It’s in your pocket,” the driver said. 
“I am a cop,” she yelled. “You’re going to f**king jail for stealing my car.” 
“I’m not going to jail,” the driver responded. 
“Whatever,” Weiss said before storming off to wait for backup. 
When deputies arrived on scene, they confirmed that Weiss did, in fact, have a gun. 
“She had a gun in her hand pointed at me,” said the driver. 
In a small victory for the driver, the deputies refused to back up Weiss and allowed him to tow the truck as he was well within the law to do so. Also, instead of the normal impound fee of $62.50, Weiss had to pay double as she held the driver up for more than 15 minutes. 
Afraid that deputies may single him out later, the tow truck driver chose to remain anonymous. But he did say that had Weiss approached him calmly he would have gladly given her the truck back free of charge. 
“That’s when I was even more shocked that I was seeing that kind of behavior from a deputy. That would be the last person I would expect to be behaving that way,” the driver said. “I expected a little bit different from a professional. (They’re someone) that’s supposed to be trained to handle situations like this.” 
According to a report obtained by WFTV, Weiss is no angel. Weiss’ disciplinary record revealed she was suspended in 2008 for violating OCSO’s use of authority policy. 
Weiss was suspended for 21 hours without pay after she was accused of acting inappropriately regarding a business arrangement, the Sheriff’s Office’s said. 
According to the Sheriff’s Office, the incident is now under an internal investigation, but there will not be a full report until the investigation is complete.

Congressional Republicans grilled her for hours about it, but have found nothing. These same Republicans just keep on complaining anyway.

At least Hillary Clinton didn’t blab classified information on television. 
Many news outlets falsely reported that the entire investigation was back on. 
The Associated Press tweeted: BREAKING: US official: Newly discovered emails related to Clinton investigation did not come from her private server.

The emails were found during the investigation of disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner and his latest sexting scandal involving a 15-year-old girl. 
The FBI doesn’t know for sure what is in the emails. It is very difficult to read emails when you don’t have a warrant to do so. This puts Comey’s letter to Congress in an even shadier light. All they know is that none of the emails are to or from Clinton herself, and they may only be duplicates of emails the FBI already has in their possession. 
The Department of Justice has received a complaint from the Democratic Coalition Against Trump accusing FBI Director Comey of violating the Hatch Act . 
The complaint reads in part: “This is an election year, and we are just 11 days away from the date that the American public votes to choose the next President of the United States, I am writing to ask that an investigation be opened into Director Comey for any potential violations of the Hatch Act. The timing of this announcement, accompanied by the vague facts of the investigation, seems as if Director Comey was making a political move, and not a professional one.” 
Passed in 1939, the Hatch Act limits political activity of federal employees and certain state and D.C. employees who work with federal funding. It is meant to keep federal agencies from taking sides politically, and prevents employees from getting promotions based on political affiliations.",0

We’ve had a bipartisan belief in American foreign policy, based on the   War II institutions, that believed in [a] democratic, global world, which Russia and the Soviet Union was often seen as hostile to. And most Republicans and Democrats have always basically believed in this world order. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and maybe Marine Le Pen do not agree with this basic structure of the world. They seem to have no respect for the institutions that were created after World War II, and they see a potential alliance of populists around the world, who would fight Islam and restore a certain semblance of traditional values.

21921,Escaped London Zoo gorilla only drinks Robinsons blackcurrant squash,"Topics: Gorilla , London Zoo , waitrose , escaped   
A gorilla that escaped from its enclosure at London Zoo made its way into Waitrose to buy Robinsons blackcurrant squash before being returned to his den, a report has found. 
Kumbuka, a western lowland silverback, made a trip to the nearest Waitrose after walking past two different Tescos and a Sainsbury's, according to sightings. 
The zoo said the gorilla refuses outright to have anything not bought from a Waitrose store, with exception of a Budgen's if he's in a good mood. 
In his report on the breakout, one of the zookeepers suggested that the 29st alpha male would probably after ""some ripe avocados or quinoa"". 
He said: ""There were no broken locks, Kumbuka did not smash any windows, he was never 'on the loose' and he was more than likely just after some good-quality high-end essentials like their reasonably priced ironing water at £3.50 a bottle."" 
'Looks down his nose' 
The gorilla found the door to his area was unlocked and a second door had yet to be secured shortly after his feeding time at 17:00 BST last Thursday. 
After discovering Kumbuka was missing, the keeper was heard saying ""He has a tendency to look down his nose a bit. He wouldn't be seen dead in a Wilkinsons"", prompting park staff to believe he'd be in the local Waitrose or John Lewis. 
Eye witnesses report the animal ""briefly explored the Whole Foods aisle before heading over to the fruit section for some organic bananas"" 
He then skipped past the own brand squash and went straight for the full-priced Robinsons. He was discovered 'having opened and drank five litres of undiluted Robinsons blackcurrant squash, eaten 47 jars of palm oil free peanut butter and holding a basket full of soy and linseed bread', the report revealed. 
It concluded that the gorilla was always very conscious of where he shops and tries to make ethical choices where he can, even if he is a bit of a sucker for Robinsons squash. 
Kumbuka was returned to his den shortly after being tranquilised. 
Kumbuka arrived in London from Paignton Zoo in Devon in early 2013. Make Alex Jelly's  ",0

21930,Hillary Admits In Leaked Email That Clinton Donors Are Funding ISIS,"By Alice Salles at theantimedia.org
In an email between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, the former first lady and secretary of state cites “ Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region ” to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of “ providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region .”
Citing the need to “ use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets ,” the candidate told Podesta the current developments in the Middle East were “ important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country .” In the same email, Clinton seemed to claim Turkey needed to be reassured of America’s willingness to “ take serious actions, ” an effort that “ [could] be sustained to protect our national interests ” in the region.
In another piece of correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai , claimed the Ambassador from Qatar would “ like to see [Bill Clinton] ‘for five minutes’ in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promised for [his] birthday in 2011 ,” adding that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would “ welcome [the Clinton Foundation’s] suggestions for investments in Haiti — particularly on education and health .” Desai added that while Qatar had already “ allocated most of their $20 million … [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest .”
Al Jazeera , a Qatar-based, state-funded news organization, recently ran a list of “ revealing, juicy and quirky emails ” leaked by WikiLeaks. In its list, the news organization went over the “pay-for-play” scheme involving the Clinton Foundation, going so far as to mention an email confirming the king of Morocco offered $12m “for the endowment” — as long as Clinton was willing to take part in a meeting.
Nevertheless, the state-funded broadcaster failed to bring up the Qatar connection. Unfortunately for the organization, Wikileaks promptly noticed the omission.
In a post on Facebook , the WikiLeaks official page said, “ Al Jazeera’s list of juiciest Wikileaks forgets to mention the revelation that Qatar funds both ISIS & Bill Clinton. ”

Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his prime minister Dmitry Medvedev to Israel Wednesday, Nov. 9 as a gesture to mark the 25th anniversary of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries. It was not the only one: Almost his first action on arrival was a symbolic visit to the Western Wall, the eternal Jewish shrine in Jerusalem. Medvedev chose this gesture to underscore the comment he made last week: “Russia never denied Israel’s or the Jewish people’s rights in Jerusalem and in its holy sites, and the subject has been blown out of proportion.” The Russian prime minister was therefore demonstrating Moscow’s recognition for Jewish rights in Israel, Jerusalem and its holy places – most of all Temple Mount – not just for the Palestinians. It was a message directed by the Kremlin to extremist Muslim organizations, which have set themselves the goal of “liberating Jerusalem from Israeli occupation.” On the broader level, Putin through Medvedev was telling the world, and the US in particular, that Russia was ready to act as peacemaker between the Arab world and Israel, with greater flexibility on the Jerusalem question than Washington has exhibited.",0
21932,PERJURY: Clueless Huma Abedin May Have Lied Under Oath About Turning Over All Devices,"0 comments 
Anthony Weiner (aka Carlos Danger) and his Pandora’s email box may just do in Huma Abedin AND Hillary Clinton. It just gets wackier and wackier by the minute. Huma testified that she turned over ALL devices that had State Department information and communications on them. Not so much. One wonders how 10’s of thousands of her emails got on Weiner’s laptop. Did she put them there or did he get copies of them for some sleazy reason? As DC churns, the soap opera continues. 
It definitely looks like Huma Abedin lied… in fact, perjured herself. Currently, Huma is nowhere to be found. Word has it she is holed up at home and Clinton is distancing herself from her. Hey Hildabeast… that’s not going to save your skanky behind. This time, you don’t have plausible deniability because you and Abedin were literally joined at the hip. Her crimes are your crimes. What’s worse, remember those pesky laptops that the FBI said they destroyed? Nope, they lied and kept them. Panicking now would be good guys. 
From The Daily Beast : 
…the new information that the FBI found State Department-related email on her home laptop also calls into question whether Abedin in fact turned over all of the devices she used to send and receive email while working at State. 
On June 28, 2016, Abedin said under oath in a sworn deposition that she looked for all devices that she thought contained government work on them so the records could be given to the State Department. (These records were subsequently reviewed by the FBI.) 
“How did you go about searching for what records you may have in your possession to be returned to the State Department?” Attorney Ramona Cotca for Judicial Watch asked her. 
“I looked for all the devices that may have any of my State Department work on it and returned — returned — gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents. And gave them devices and paper,” Abedin answered. 
That’s definitely a problemo for the Clinton campaign. Now, Huma is claiming she has no idea how all those emails got on that laptop. She’s using the Schultz defense: “I know nothing!” And all of this was uncovered when Weiner couldn’t keep his Johnson where it belonged. He’s being investigated for approaching a 15 year-old girl in a sexting sting by the FBI. Four devices were seized in that case and surprise, surprise, surprise! Lookie what they found. Since the email scandal case was not officially closed yet, they had to reveal additional evidence found. Plus, those laptops that weren’t destroyed (oops!) are now being investigated. Not good for the Clinton camp. 
A source told Fox News that there were over 10,000 emails of Huma’s on Weiner’s laptop… and they were ‘pertinent’ to the email investigation. It sounds to me as if Huma kept a copy of everything just in case, if you get my drift. The only thing holding up the crap from hitting the fan is the DOJ is refusing to give a warrant to the FBI for the laptop. But at some point either they will have to or a federal judge will stop in. Timing is everything here. 
Huma won’t be able to play dumb or lie her way out of this one and I suspect Hillary knows that. The question is, will she implode before or after the election? Related Items Terresa Monroe-Hamilton

Border Patrol agent was discovered on the side of a roadway with serious injuries to his head, chest, and hands, according to officials. The Border Patrol agent appears to have been ruthlessly attacked. Sources first alerted Breitbart Texas to the incident and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed many of the details on the matter. The Border Patrol agent is assigned to the Deming, New Mexico, Border Patrol Station which is in the El Paso Sector. [According to CBP:  “U. S. Customs and Border Protection is assisting in the investigation of a report of an assault against an   Border Patrol agent assigned to the Deming, New Mexico, Border Patrol Station. The agent was discovered on the side of the road by a motorist at 11 p. m. MDT. The agent suffered multiple, serious injuries to his head, chest and hands. Emergency Medical Services transported the agent to a nearby hospital where he is being treated for his wounds. The agent is in stable condition. CBP is working closely with the FBI, Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office, and the El Paso Police Department on the ongoing investigation. CBP has informed its workforce of this report and has reminded its law enforcement personnel to be alert and aware of their surroundings and potential threats related to their service. ” The region immediately south of the border in the area is controlled by the Juarez Cartel and their enforcers, La Linea. They operate in the El Paso Sector and are known to abduct individuals and administer torture techniques. The fact that the FBI is investigating the matter, rather than just local law enforcement agencies, would indicate that the attack on the Border Patrol agent is due to his employment as a law enforcement officer with the U. S. government. Also, the warning issued by CBP to Border Patrol agents indicates that the violent attack was related to the agent’s employment as a law enforcement officer with the U. S. government. The warning shows that CBP feels this attack indicates possible risks to additional agents along the U. S.  border. CBP did not alert the public or other Border Patrol agents until after the agency was contacted by Breitbart Texas. Only after CBP was contacted, did they hurry and publish a statement. A spokesman for CBP contradicts this assertion and claims that they internally notified agents, not the public, prior to being contacted by Breitbart Texas.

21939,Key Time In Collective Human History,"Leave a reply 
Katie Gallanti – This is a key time in our collective humanity’s history… dark power versus true power, underhanded manipulative energy versus the clean heart. The true heart can be hurt and wounded, but the true heart is strong, has vision, endurance and when connected to Source can draw deep resourcefulness and grace. 
As a human family this is our time to claim this Earth for the true human heart. All darkne ss be gone. We claim it first and foremost within. By believing and holding steady even in when all looks lost or hopeless. 
Each one of us is an anchor of love and Source energy. And by love I do not mean this wishy washy sappy love of the hallmark cards, but the fierce stand up to be counted, protector love, of the Spiritual Warrior’s heart. The love of the mother that guards her young. The love of the father that protects. The love of Source that imbues all things. 
Earthly life is not eternal. In a way a play we are immersed with in which we explore and test the Soul in all sorts of circumstances. Currently the play is a very intense story of collective awakening and empowerment under a very intense set of circumstances. In this we learn about resilience and about the deeper aspects of hope. 
The elections are just a vehicle via which the human empowerment story is expressing right now. Its not so much about Trump versus Clinton, but about The People versus The Evil Empire. Things are being manipulated. The game is not clean. And The People at large are beginning to see the wizard behind the curtain pulling strings in droves. Right now the wizard still has the upper hand. But the wizard is not invincible, no matter how tall he looks and how clever the slight of hand. 
As usual, there are rules to creation energy. Believing something is possible is key. The strongest block to such belief is the inner wounding we all carry that predisposes to helplessness. Much of that inner wounding has been created purposefully, by design, in a society that has inbuilt fracturing and division from the earliest of ages. 
But we are not our society. We are not our wounds. We our not our fears. We are the Human Soul. We are the multidimensional beauty and the radiance of our inner light spanning eons of time. We are all the star systems we have visited. And all the infinite of our transcendent experience. And we are expansion in the light of Source, within which all finds peace, as well as strength. 
Humanity is often referred to in terms of its flawd-ness : “I am just human”. But out humanity is the territory of paradox. So flawed and yet so vast. So vulnerable and yet capable of the deepest inner breath. So cruel and mean at times and yet also capable of infinite nobility. 
Reclaim your pure human Soul… invite Source into the human story… recharge and breathe in strength and honor, as you intend the future of the new humanity into being.

21940,Judge warns Trump campaign on voter intimidation in Ohio,"Judge warns Trump campaign on voter intimidation in Ohio By Press TV on November 4, 2016 
A US federal judge has issued an order, warning Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign against harassing or intimidating Ohio voters. 
US District Judge James Gwin ruled on Friday that anyone who hinders or delays a prospective voter from reaching the polling place and casting a ballot inside or near Ohio polling places would face contempt-of-court charges. 
Gwin also ruled that pro-Trump operative Roger Stone cannot question voters “under the guise of the purported ‘exit polling’ or ‘citizen journalist’ operations organized and encouraged” by Stone and a group called Stop the Steal. 
The ruling comes after Ohio Democrats have lodged a complaint that Stone was seeking to engage in his own version of exit polling, which they claimed was aimed at hassling voters. 
“We think Democrats and Republicans have every right to hand out leaflets at polls and everything else but what we don’t want is harassment or intimidation and the judge is obviously trying to balance that,” said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. 
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has denied it was participating in any illegal activity. 
“Intimidating voters is illegal, and the campaign does not remotely condone such conduct,” Trump campaign lawyer Chad A. Readler of Jones Day wrote in a legal filing in Ohio earlier this week. 
“This case is one of four coordinated attacks across the country that are clearly long-planned efforts to sow chaos in the Defendants’ political efforts, while garnering maximum publicity for Plaintiff’s unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims on the eve of the Presidential Election,” Readler added. 
According to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Friday, Trump’s support has increased in 24 states and decreased in 11 over the past week. In comparison, support for his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has grown in 13 states and lessened in 22. Related Posts: Afraid of What?

21942,Romans Launch Protest Against Pope Francis: ‘Where’s Your Mercy?’,"Romans woke up Saturday to find their city plastered with hundreds of posters criticizing Pope Francis’   governance of the Church. [After making a name for himself as an   grandfatherly figure with an emphasis on mercy over doctrine, Pope Francis has undertaken a series of ostensibly harsh measures that have left many observers scratching their heads in perplexity.  The posters that adorned the city of Rome Saturday bore an image of the pontiff along with a list of his alleged recent misuses of papal power, including ignoring cardinals, removing priests and “beheading” two Catholic organizations. The posters follow a   tradition of Romans’ public, albeit anonymous, criticism of the Pope when he is seen to overstep his mandate. In past times, discontent Romans would attach their written complaints to an ancient, dilapidated statue called “il Pasquino” near Piazza Navona. The text of the poster was written in “Romanaccio,” a rough dialect of street Italian spoken around the nation’s capital city. In translation, the full text reads, “Hey Frankie, you have emasculated Congregations, suspended priests, decapitated the Order of Malta and the Franciscans of the Immaculate, ignored Cardinals  …     Where is your mercy?” Having placed great stress on mercy since the beginning of his pontificate, Francis has found himself particularly susceptible to the criticism of a certain   since he has reserved his most strident invectives for conservatives, labelling them rigid, doctrinaire and legalistic. In recent times, he has increasingly passed from words to actions, including notoriously twice demoting conservative Cardinal Raymond Burke —  the former head of the Church’s highest court —  and firing Vatican clerics who allegedly criticized the Pope in private. The series of moves have led some critics to speak of an “ideological purge” being carried out by Pope Francis. In a recent article, veteran Catholic reporter Philip Lawler offered a partial list of the pontiff’s supposedly autocratic actions of the sort criticized by the Roman posters. Among the measures were the Pope’s “wholesale replacement of the prelates on the Congregation for Divine Worship,” substituting more conservative clerics with a panel that will be “more friendly to the preferences of Pope Francis, and less supportive of the   prefect, Cardinal Robert Sarah. ” Lawler also mentions the “abrupt dismissal of three clerics on the staff of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,” for which no explanation was given. According to reports, the Pope made a point of saying that he did not have to give an explanation for the sacking. In point of fact, the priests had been accused of making “unflattering comments about Pope Francis” in private conversations, leading to speculation of how Francis got wind of the remarks. Then there was the “contemptuous treatment” of the four cardinals who submitted questions (dubia) about a recent papal letter called Amoris Laetitia, which left many wondering how the Pope’s ambiguous teaching on Holy Communion for divorced and remarried Catholics squared with the traditional doctrine of the Church. Unlike his immediate predecessors, Pope Francis has also reserved important promotions to   bishops, stacking the College of Cardinals with progressive newcomers while snubbing more senior prelates whose approach does not match his own. Criticizing the Pope apparently has an upside. While Roman public services are noteworthy for their inability to remove ubiquitous graffiti throughout the city, they were somehow able to remove all the posters criticizing the Pope before nightfall Saturday.

21943,3 Competing Theories On Why The FBI Re-opened The Hillary Email Server Investigation,"3 Competing Theories On Why The FBI Re-opened The Hillary Email Server Investigation The FBI normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation American Thinker   
There is no question that re-opening the FBI Investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server is a big deal. The FBI normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation. NBC reports: 
The FBI is reviewing a new batch of Hillary Clinton emails, bureau director James Comey said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday. 
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation … I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,” he wrote. 
The very first thing to note is that Comey made no mention of a grand jury. The emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation. If that is the case, further subpoenas are quite possible, a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date. 
There are 3 competing theories as to why he might be doing this now that come to mind. He might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation, recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the FBI is substantial. Three days ago, American Thinker published an open letter from a retired FBI Agent, Hugh Galyean, that laid out some of the damage Comey has inflicted on the institution he leads. There is little doubt that this reached many in the FBI family, putting in print what people have only whispered about. If those silenced voices start speaking out, Comey could face a serious loss of face. In this scenario, he is heading off a staff rebellion, possibly including mass resignations. Rush Limbaugh today discussed an alternative theory, that by announcing an FBI Investigation resuming, Comey is putting a lid on further attention to Wikileaks. I guess this means that Clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete (after the election) before speaking about what the evil Russians are planting into our politics. It is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would, be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election. In this scenario, Comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed, and that he would be held accountable after it comes out. This scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis, involving the possible indictment of a president-elect before an election. Or the evidence being turned over to the House of Representatives for impeachment hearings. 
We’ll know more in the coming days, and I am sure there are other possible theories and motives. It is shame that we have to speculate, and that the once-respected FBI director is now subject to analysis of his political gamesmanship.

21945,Hillary Already Planning Fireworks for Victory Celebration,"Hillary Already Planning Fireworks for Victory Celebration November 1, 2016 
People of the United States, your royal family . 
Law enforcement officials and the FDNY have been told to prepare for a barge-launched pyrotechnic display off Manhattan’s Javits Center, where Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine will join their supporters for the Nov. 8 vote count, sources said. 
The aerial detonations would last for two minutes, with the triumphal celebration permitted to start as early as 9:30 p.m. — a mere half-hour after the polls close in New York, sources said. 
Fortunately pride has never been known to come before a fall. And hubris is a notoriously positive trait with no negative consequences. That must be why Hillary Clinton is down in the polls and facing yet another investigation while feuding with the FBI. 
Cops and firefighters were blown away by Clinton’s hubris in planning the fireworks display, which would eclipse the shower of blazing sparkles that preceded the balloon drop at July’s Democratic National Convention. 
“It’s a little presumptuous of her to plan on winning. I guess she put in for this before Friday,” one NYPD detective said. 
Others said the actual election results could put a damper on things, but one firefighter raised the specter of a 2000-style recount and added, “So what’s she going to do, put the fireworks on ice?” 
The arrogance is truly unchecked.",0
21948,Donald Trump Meets With Black Leaders Ahead of Detroit Church Visit - The New York Times,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Amid confusion over whether he would speak at a black church this weekend, Donald J. Trump’s halting attempts to win over   voters took him to Philadelphia on Friday, where he spoke with a small group of business owners and community leaders and had an emotional meeting with the mother of a young woman who was killed by undocumented immigrants. After largely avoiding black audiences during his campaign, Mr. Trump had arranged to appear at a prominent black church, Great Faith Ministries, in Detroit on Saturday. After a New York Times report that he would not address the congregation and would give only scripted answers to questions   by the pastor, his campaign said Thursday that Mr. Trump would speak to the crowd for five to 10 minutes. But on Friday afternoon, the pastor, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, insisted that talk of Mr. Trump speaking was only “rumors” and that he would be allowed to offer only a short greeting to the congregation, not a pitch for why they should vote for him. “When we have guests, whether they are a celebrity, an actress, an actor, or whether it’s just somebody who is well known, we do allow them to say, ‘I’m here today,’” Mr. Jackson said. “A greeting. Thank you very much and sit down. There is not going to be a 10 minute speech from nobody. No. ” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond on Friday. The night before, his senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, had said Mr. Trump was eager to present himself to members of the church. “If you know anything about Mr. Trump, it’s that he will want the opportunity to take his vision and message of opportunity directly to the people on Saturday,” Mr. Miller had said. Mr. Trump’s support among black voters remains dismal, low even by Republican standards, owing to a string of slights that include his questioning of President Obama’s birth certificate and his dismissive treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters. But in swing states like Pennsylvania, winning over even a few new   voters could mean the difference. Mr. Trump believes his calls to end illegal immigration can transcend racial lines, and on Friday, he met with a black woman, Shalga Hightower, 55, who wept as she described how her    daughter Iofemi was murdered, along with two friends, by a group of men which included two undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump asked about the fate of the young men and Ms. Hightower said that they had all received life sentences. “But they should have never been here,” said Mr. Trump, looking solemn as he consoled the crying mother. “But they should have never been here, absolutely,” she replied. When reporters asked about a few dozen protesters who could be heard shouting outside, Ms. Hightower’s son, Jamar Hightower, 26, jumped into the discussion. “It’s way bigger than that,” he said. “I mean there’s freedom of speech and they can think what they want. But, at the end of the day, I feel as though this man is the only one that’s actually standing up to do something about it. ” The Hightowers and the 12 local leaders, most of them Republicans, who met with Mr. Trump Friday were aware that many black Americans have a dim view of the candidate. Even so, Daphne Goggins, a local party leader, thanked Mr. Trump for coming and wept as she said: “For the first time in my life, I feel like my vote is going to count. ” And Renee Amoore, the founder of a consulting firm, said she appreciated Mr. Trump for “coming to the hood. ” “That’s a big deal,” she said. “Let’s be clear here, folks. ”",0
21949,Cash-Strapped Lefties Demand Money for Anti-Breitbart Site,"A German journalist is appealing for money to found a new website that he claims will counter the growing popularity of Breitbart News in Germany, ahead of the federal election later this year. [Christoph Knappes’s has christened his proposed site “Schmalbart” a   words reffering to the German origins of the surname ‘Breitbart’. While ‘Breitbart’ translated, refers to one in possession of a ‘broad beard’ Schmalbart describes the opposite  —   ‘Smallbeard’.  So far, Mr. Kappes has raised just over €700 (£600, $750) in monthly subscriptions for the project, including from Social Democratic MP Saskia Esker who has recently taken to tweeting at German companies while claiming that Breitbart News is a “  site”. According to the fundraising page, Mr. Kappes’s project is designed to “combat populism” and the site will “fight incitement, racism,   and any other kind of human hostility”. He says the site will not just be limited to articles but will be active on social media, saying “We will be at the places where the discussions are”. The manifesto for the proposed   site was released in November on Mr. Kappes’s website. According to the post, Breitbart News follows an “extreme right wing ideology of social Darwinism”. He claims that a German language Breitbart bureau could garner an audience of up to “six million” in Germany, and complains that the German middle class “lack civil courage”. Writers should “avoid arrogance” when dealing with the public, Mr Kappes goes on to opine, saying: “Schmalbart must avoid condescension”. He added: “simple language is mandatory”. The project is set to employ several authors, editorial staff, web designers, and others to manage fundraising campaigns. It is not known how the site intends to maintain such a large paid staff given that it is presently is raising just €740 per month. As the German federal election approaches later this year, the German establishment media, along with their counterparts in the U. S. have targeted Breitbart News. Accusations of “fake news” have abounded and some, like The New York Times, have encouraged readers to hound advertisers on social media. American left wing political operative David Brock announced a similar project to Schmalbart last month and like his German counterpart is seeking cash. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also taken steps toward a free speech crackdown by accusing Russia and others of trying to influence the federal election through news and cyber attacks. The German Interior Ministry has also proposed a “defence centre” be created to combat news and information the German government deems to be “fake news”.",0

It is well past time to put an end to the cronyism and deceit that has transformed Washington into a graveyard of good intentions. ”  The amendment would limit senators to two terms (12 years total) and representatives to three terms (6 years total) the Washington Examiner reported.

Who the fuck do we think we are going into another god damn country, saying who the fuck should do what the fuck with their god damn time, their god damn rights and to what ultimate purpose do we serve fighting someone elses fucking war for them. 
Are you kidding me, that we spend how much fucking money fighting a bunch of god damn who knows what the fuck! 
This is some seriously disturbing shit happening here! 
I can't even imagine what kind of Gustapo shit it's going to take for every citizen of every god damn province, city, territory, continent, god damn mother fucking family units upon family units to say enough already.

A couple fucking thousand people on this entire planet with the amount of money exceeding the wealth of how many people and nations, take all those mother fuckers benefiting off of all of us and our suffering and just take everything away from them and send them off to try again in some slums off the west coast 
Sweet mother fucking justice of mother earth, that would be something to be prized and enjoyed for sure. 
Normally it doesn' matter who you vote for in an election. It's all rigged. But this election is different. This election has a wild card gone rogue. This dude says what the fuck he wants when he wants and doesn't give a shit who he's defending. 
If you have soaked up the last year or so of political propaganda being spewed at you through your boob tube you would probably unconsciously be aware subtly that you should vote Clinton. I mean if you look at all the endorsements and current shit being said out there about anti-Trump, you can only just use common sense to connect the dots of whom your handlers and the controllers of your universe are trying to steer you in. 
Sure Trump will fuck some shit up, he'll definitely ensure that his and his own are well taken care of and lined within years to come of financial wealth and freedoms. Clinton much of the same, the only difference being that Clinton will do as she's said where Trump will say go fuck yourself. 
This is the handlers, the beast system, the powers that be's greatest fear and their working extra hard to prevent it from happening and becoming a reality. Tags",0

21965,Comment on Abuse Survivor Speaks Out: “Cops Stood Guard as I was Raped by Politicians as a Child” by Laert Kolaveri,"Home / Badge Abuse / Abuse Survivor Speaks Out: “Cops Stood Guard as I was Raped by Politicians as a Child” Abuse Survivor Speaks Out: “Cops Stood Guard as I was Raped by Politicians as a Child” Matt Agorist May 26, 2015 143 Comments 
Staffordshire, Eng — An abuse survivor has bravely broken her silence to tell her horrific childhood story. In an interview with Sky News, Esther Baker, 32, explained how she and other children were raped by politicians as uniformed police officers stood guard. 
“I got the feeling very much that they were protecting somebody, that they were with one of the men,” said Baker. 
“One of them (police officers) I knew from church. There were a few occasions where they would be in uniform, and I kind of knew, I learnt that when they were in uniform that it was going to be a rough night,” she explained. “On occasion they would – they would sort of join in.” 
During one of the incidents, Baker recalls that she was able to run away, only to be chased down and caught by a police officer. Apparently the police officer was apologetic as he carried her back to the rapist politicians. He must have “just been doing his job.” 
“There was one that I can remember, one of the times I tried to run away and tried to get away from them and he came after me, caught up with me and he was carrying me back to where the rest of them were and he said he was sorry,” she said. 
Baker explained how she and other children around the age of 6 were often brought to various properties and given alcohol and then raped by judges and lords. 
This poor young girl thought the rape was normal. Since everyone called these men “lords,” she thought they were doing God’s work. 
“I don’t quite know how to explain. I was brought up in a religious household and one thing that kept me so sure that what they were doing was right was that there were references to people, Lords and a judge,” she said. “I picked up on those names because I thought one of them must have been God because one of them was ‘Our Lord.'” 
“I just thought that they were on God’s authority.” 
Now that Baker has courageously come forward, despite the deadly threats she received and the police being involved, authorities are claiming that they will investigate her claims thoroughly. 
“I always swore I would never go near the police again – never. I was scared because it feels like, yeah, they are going to know I have said something so the only way I can now protect myself is now to tell,” Baker said. “I just hope others will do the same. That is the only way we are going to be safe.” 
Sadly Baker’s story is not an isolated one. 
Jessa Dillow-Crisp recently testified at the Colorado State Capitol, during Human Trafficking Awareness and Advocacy Day, about the horrible experiences that she had in her past. 
She was unable to report the abuse or go to the police because there were a number of police officers who were involved in her kidnapping and abuse. 
“There was gang raping, the police officer who handcuffed me and raped me, told me I would be put in jail if I opened my voice, ” she said. Share",0

21976,BREAKING: Obama: “We Have Not Had a Major Scandal” in My Administration! HAHAHA!,"0 comments Obama was speaking to donors at a private fundraiser in California when he railed against former House Oversight Committee Chair Darrell Issa for calling his administration corrupt. 
“Here’s a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history — despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration,” Obama said! 
Obama has had more scandals than any president in history! Just because the MSM refuses to report on them does not mean they do not exist! 
Breitbart reports : 
Issa was the key figure in several investigations of the Obama administration, including the Fast and Furious debacle with Attorney General Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton’s failure in Benghazi, the failures in the Veterans Affairs department, and the IRS using its power to target conservative Tea Party groups for investigations. 
Obama accused Issa of wasting taxpayer money “on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere.” 
“This guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee,” Obama said. 
We could list 77 scandals, but here are just 7 of the biggest! 
1.) IRS Targeting Scandal 
In 2013, Lois Lerner, former director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division, admitted that officials in the IRS’ Cincinnati office acted improperly. 2.) VA Waiting List 
The Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general first noted the waiting list problem at a Phoenix clinic in 2014 and then found other clinics with similar problems. Veterans were placed on phony waiting lists, and some even died while waiting for care. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned from his position. 3.) GSA Spending Spree 
In 2012, Martha N. Johnson, the administrator of the General Services Administration, resigned after the federal procurement agency was engulfed in a controversy. The department was accused of allowing excessive spending on travel and conferences for the agency and employees. 4.) Attack on the Benghazi Compound 
On Sept. 11, 2012, weeks before a presidential election, terrorists attacked U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Obama administration officials initially blamed this attack on a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim YouTube video that spun out of control. 5.) Clinton Emails 
It was the Benghazi committee that first discovered that before, during, and after her time as secretary of state, Clinton maintained a private email server. This prompted the FBI to investigate questions of whether Clinton violated the law in terms of storing classified information. 6.) Fast and Furious Gun Walking 
Operation Fast and Furious was a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives program, meant to be a sting operation. It allowed about 2,000 guns to flow to Mexican drug trafficking organizations under federal supervision before authorities lost control of the guns. 7.) Solyndra Subsidies 
The Energy Department provided a $535 million loan guarantee to the politically connected solar panel firm Solyndra as part of the 2009 stimulus bill. Not long after building its factory, the California firm filed for bankruptcy protection and an FBI investigation ensued. The company did not find a buyer and eventually closed down. So Barack Obama…just shut up!",0
21979,Silenced: DC Radio Station Pulls Pro-Life Ad Off Air - Breitbart,"The Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) says Washington, D. C. radio station WTOP has pulled its   ad off the air after receiving complaints from listeners. [The national   organization’s paid urges the redirection of taxpayer funds from abortion business Planned Parenthood to other federally qualified healthcare centers that provide more comprehensive care.   The ad script is as follows: “It’s a fact: Planned Parenthood is America’s largest abortion business   …    nearly a million abortions in the last three years. Its executives were caught on tape bragging about selling baby body parts. Under federal investigation, Planned Parenthood spent thirty million last election on political activism, not women’s healthcare. It’s time for Congress to act. It’s time to redirect Planned Parenthood’s funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care to women, not abortions.  —   Paid for by Susan B. Anthony List, “Susan B. Anthony List has learned from Washington, D. C. radio station WTOP that it will discontinue airing our paid regarding taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood,” said SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser. “This regrettable response to our radio spot on one of the lead topics in the current national debate is shameful for a First Amendment institution like WTOP. ” Dannenfelser added: One of the surest signs that a policy message like ours is effective is its opponents’ pushing to silence it. Planned Parenthood speaks boldly of its pride in performing more abortions than any other entity in the United States and packaging the body parts of these aborted children for profitable use. These are the facts, however uncomfortable they may be for some to hear. Rest assured that SBA List will continue to unveil and champion the truth about Planned Parenthood, no matter what they and their allies do to suppress the reality behind their public masks. SBA List is launching a $500, 000 campaign to expose Planned Parenthood as a   abortion business to which women’s actual health and safety is far from a priority. Planned Parenthood receives more than a half billion taxpayer dollars per year and performs more than 323, 000 abortions per year as well. The radio and digital advertising campaign, which targets Washington, D. C. and key states, takes off as Congress moves closer to eliminating the taxpayer funding of the nation’s largest abortion chain. The Senate has passed a budget resolution bill, the first step in the process to repeal Obamacare and redirect Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding using the budget reconciliation procedure. Dannenfelser and her organization are urging the House to follow up by passing the Senate’s budget resolution. She points out that federally qualified healthcare centers in communities “provide comprehensive health care for women and families. ” “These centers outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities by a 20:1 ratio,” she continues. “Redirecting the abortion giant’s taxpayer funding will fulfill a major   commitment made by   Trump to end Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding as long as they continue to perform abortions. ” A recent poll released by SBA List found “a majority or plurality of voters in 2018 Senate battleground states oppose giving tax dollars to Planned Parenthood. ” “A majority in North Dakota, Montana, Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Florida also said they would be less likely to vote for Senators who support sending tax dollars to the abortion giant rather than community health centers,” the group states.

21980,’For Honor’ Players Discover All Unlocks Would Cost over $700 – or 2.5 Years of Playtime - Breitbart,"The developers of the flawed but original medieval brawler For Honor are getting a lot of heat from the game’s player base over its progression system and microtransactions. [When Redditor bystander007 calculated that unlocking everything in the game would require either over $730 in microtransactions or 2. 5 years of gameplay, the community effectively burst into flame. Most people would frown on spending $60 in microtransactions for a    title spending over $700 in a title that already cost $ $220  —   depending on which edition was bought  —   wasn’t received particularly well, to say the least.  For Honor Director Damien Kieken responded to the concern in an interview on Ubisoft’s Warrior’s Den Weekly Livestream (at the 24 minute mark). His answer? Players were never supposed to unlock everything in the game in the first place.  Kieken said that the team “never had an intention for you to unlock everything in the game,” adding that it “doesn’t really make any sense. ” He described For Honor as a PvP fighting game with “RPG mechanics” layered on. He then compared the dynamic to MMORPG World of Warcraft, asserting that “you would never try to unlock everything for all the characters. ” There are problems with this analogy. First, that is neither how most RPGs nor most fighting games work. Second, For Honor is hardly an MMO like World of Warcraft in all but the broadest definition of the term. Kieken went further: “We forecasted that most players would play one to three characters. And that’s what we see today in our game. Most players focus on one character, one hero, and others go up to two or three heroes. All of the design is based around that. ” But all that really tells consumers is that the pricing structure has been arranged to make each unlockable item as expensive as possible within the time they spend playing. Kieken went so far as to compare the cosmetic items to endgame content, like the rewards for World of Warcraft’s   activities. If you don’t like it, Kieken suggests you simply change your expectations. “Completionist” players could focus less on their ability to gain tangible rewards or progression and more on reaching “reputation one” level on all heroes and working from there. The For Honor community remains less than impressed by the response. While the game is certainly fun to play, it has committed the cardinal sin of pushing successively more elaborate   and then stuffing the game full of microtransactions to supplement its otherwise glacial progression.

Clinton’s most emailed aid in the US State Department, Jake Sullivan, used personal email to talk with Clinton about bringing down Libya . Unsecured servers — open for all to see. 
Hillary’s Leadership in Libya led to: 
Prior to the February 17, 2011, “Day of Rage,” Libya had a national budget surplus of 8.7 percent of GDP in 2010, with oil production at 1.8 million barrels per day, on track to reach its goal of 3 million barrels per day. Currently, oil production has decreased by over 80 percent. Following the revolution, the Libyan economy contracted by an estimated 41.8 percent, with a national deficit of 17.1 percent GDP in 2011. 
Before the revolution, Libya was a secure, prospering, secular Islamic country and a critical ally providing intelligence on terrorist activity post–September 11, 2001. Qaddafi was no longer a threat to the United States. Yet Secretary of State Hillary Clinton strongly advocated and succeeded in convincing the administration to support the Libyan rebels with a no-fly zone, intended to prevent a possible humanitarian disaster that turned quickly into all-out war.

21984,Obama to Hillary - Under the Bus You Go,"Email 
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are standing on a street corner waiting for a bus. As the bus approaches, Obama grabs Hillary and tosses her out on to the street, where she is then run over by the oncoming bus. 
Of course, this would never happen – literally. Neither Obama nor Clinton would ever be caught dead on a bus. Under it, yes - but not in one. 
Naturally, I’m kidding about Barack tossing Hillary under the bus. He has not the strength to do so. Again – kidding. These are the jokes. I’m here all night. 
But seriously – it does appear that Obama has figuratively thrown her highness under the bus, again, for her ever-growing email scandal. I say again, for this isn’t the first time the president has done so. 
In 2015, when asked about Hillary’s private server, Obama stated , “The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the Blackberry I carry around, all those records are available and archived.” Translation – I don’t know what she has been doing, but I follow the law. 
My buddy Tim Brown at Freedom Outpost reported that both Obama and Biden, prior to the 2012 election, threw Hillary under the bus over the Benghazi scandal. Both men claimed they had no knowledge that those in Benghazi requested more security prior to the attack. Biden stated during a Vice Presidential debate that year that, “We [Biden and Obama] weren’t told they wanted more security. We did not know they wanted more security there,” effectively hanging it on Hillary. 
It’s common knowledge of the disdain the Obamas have for the Clintons, and vice versa. As far out radical as Obama is, I don’t think he’s a crook – or if he is, he is better at hiding it. Obama doesn’t appear to have sold the White House to highest bidder the way Hillary did at State – or selling naked options on her potential to become president. 
At this point, it seems Barack is probably tiring of constantly having to defend a woman he really can’t stand, which is why, in my estimation, he is once again hanging her out to dry. 
Just yesterday, White House spokes-punk Josh Earnest said that the White House stood by FBI Director James Comey on Monday as a man of 'integrity' and 'principle' in the face of a Democrat-led assault on his character and intentions. This is a major blow to Clinton – one I’m sure she is furious over. 
The Daily Mail reports Earnest stated at a daily briefing that, “The president’s assessment of his [Comey] integrity and his character has not changed. The president doesn’t believe he’s secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party.” This, despite attacks on Comey’s character by Clinton, her surrogates, and now “Dirty” Harry Reid. 
In a rather surprising turn, Earnest even defended President George W. Bush for his selection of Comey. This is highly unusual, as it is this White House’s historic M.O. to blame Bush for literally everything. 
I don’t know why the White House seems to be separating itself from the Clinton camp. If I had to guess, beyond the hatred factor, I’d say that Obama has calculated that, at this point, his legacy is far more important than a president Hillary, and he does not wish to be forever connected to the scandal-ridden candidate. It’s probably a fair calculation. That, and maybe by favoring Comey in this war, he might himself purchase some good will to keep his involvement under wraps.

21985,The Day After,"Or, how to stop worrying and love staving off the dystopian nightmare that threatens. Trump's victory party By Liam Miller / filmsforaction.org 
Here we are. President Trump. 
I’m going to say it again. The pain will stop sooner. We have to toughen ourselves up. 
President Trump. 
Look. I’m not surprised. 
Turnout was low. Trump and Clinton each got 58 million votes and change. But it was enough to hurl Trump into office. 
The polls were close; but Clinton’s supporters just haven’t been passionate enough, while Trump’s supporters are all too. 
We’re looking at a bad situation. Potentially nightmarish. But we’re also looking at the one situation that can get people to start working together who might otherwise have simply continued to jockey for power. (I’m looking at you, establishment Democrats.) 
Mind you. It’s still wretched. But look at it this way: now, we can deal with our racist, sexist, patriarchist history head on. 
Every Sanders supporter is, deep inside, saying “I told you so”. And they’re right. 
Virtually every poll had Bernie thumping Trump soundly. All the arguments people make in favor of Trump, which they seemed to think outweighed his flaws, included bucking the system. All of those people would have voted for Bernie. Someone very close to me, who had been a Republican for four decades, registered Democrat to vote for Bernie in the primary; and they voted for Trump yesterday. 
Bernie was the people's candidate; independents (who now comprise 45% of the electorate) favored him 2:1. There's no doubt he would have trounced Trump; but there is also no doubt that Bernie's ideas are America's ideals. We just can't let these lunatics have their way with the country. 
So look. There’s really no time to lose. Let’s get the ball rolling. The midterms are two years away; we need to win big. Trump has a Republican Congress; dear lord, the horror. There's a presidential election to win two years after that. Local elections up and down the line. And a lot of grassroots organizing, fundraising, and door-knocking to accomplish. 
At least the Koch brothers and most of the establishment Republicans hate him too.

21986,"Hezbollah-Tied Men Busted for Plot to Attack in New York, Panama","NEW YORK (AP)  —   Two men from Michigan and New York City were tasked by a terrorist organization with looking for potential terrorism targets in New York and Panama, U. S. authorities said Thursday as they announced the suspects’ recent arrests. [Samer El Debek, 37, of Dearborn, Michigan, and Ali Kourani, 32, of the Bronx, were charged in Manhattan federal court with providing support to a terrorist organization. El Debek was arrested June 1 in Livonia, Michigan Kourani was arrested the same day in the Bronx. Both men were being held in New York City after court appearances.  Defense lawyers did not immediately comment. In a release, authorities said the men tried to provide support to Hezbollah’s Islamic Jihad organization after receiving military training from the group. They said El Debek looked for potential targets in Panama, including U. S. and Israeli embassies, and ships in the Panama Canal, while Kourani surveilled American targets, including military and law enforcement facilities in New York City. William F. Sweeney Jr. head of the New York FBI office, said the charges “reveal once again that the New York City region remains a focus of many adversaries, demonstrated as alleged in this instance by followers of a sophisticated and determined organization with a long history of coordinating violent activities on behalf of Hezbollah. ” New York Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill said Kourani and others conducted covert surveillance of potential targets, including U. S. military bases and Israeli military personnel in New York City. O’Neill noted that Kourani, who was born in Lebanon, received sophisticated military training overseas on at least two occasions, including the use of a rocket propelled grenade. He said El Debek also was charged with possessing extensive   training from Hezbollah. Authorities said Kourani attended   weapons training in Lebanon in 2000 when he was 16. They said he lawfully entered the U. S. in 2003, obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in biomedical engineering in 2009 and a master’s in business administration in 2013. Authorities said El Debek, a naturalized U. S. citizen, was first recruited by Hezbollah in late 2007 or early 2008. They said he received military training from the group from 2008 through 2014.",0
21987,Tim Kaine: “Hillary Will Modify Obamacare To Include Gun-Addiction Therapy”,"Elections 2016 
Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine is taking aim at the NRA, saying he’s done what he can about “common sense” gun laws in his home state of Virginia, but has watched Congress falter in the face of the gun lobby. “We have to make a decision about what matters to us,” said Kaine in an opinion piece published by Time magazine Tuesday. “We have to treat this like the public health crisis it is.” Kaine notes that he is a gun owner and that he supports the Second Amendment. 
“It needs to be said that sugarcoating this sort of thing isn’t going to make it better,” Kaine also argued during his subsequent interview. “Neither Hillary Clinton nor I can stand Donald Trump, that’s common knowledge, but there is one thing about his ridiculous rhetoric I have to agree with, and that’s that political correctness in this country has long ceased to be useful. Today’s approach revolves around directness and no-beating-around-the-bush kind of mentality when it comes to communication.” 
He continued, “That’s precisely the reason why we need to tackle the gun safety issue head on and without pardon. It’s a burning problem that is affecting millions of Americans every single day, and as such, it represents an emergency. At the end of the day, public health is not something that should be neglected for the obvious reasons, and whether we’d like to admit it or not, the public health of America today is becoming increasingly gangrenous.” 
“Guns have found their way to every single layer of society and have become the preferred method of resolving disputes and mere disagreements,” Kaine said. “We must put a stop to that and I’m happy to announce that Hillary Clinton has come up with the perfect solution for this problem. She is going to modify Obamacare from its existing state into a comprehensive healthcare program that’s going to include both voluntary, but also mandatory gun-addiction therapy.” 
He also said, “That way, Republicans who just want to talk and have their side of the story heard will be listened to instead of ignored and left to their own inner demons, which tend to come up to the surface via a weapon of some sort. On the other hand, Republicans who own more than one firearm and/or shoot it regularly either at a firing range or somewhere else will be summoned to a mandatory conversation with a licensed gun-addiction psychotherapist who will make sure to explain to them that it’s perfectly okay to be a liberal and own a gun. The two aren’t mutually exclusive.” 
“And the best part? They won’t have to pay a cent for it – it will all be covered by the federal budget. So, even if you happen to be a recurring Republican and gun owner, don’t worry, we can fix you. The Hillary Clinton administration will make sure to give back to its citizens just as much as it takes from them. And when you take a Republican’s gun, you’re basically de-Americanizing him. We are going to change that. Obamacare will become a symbol for fewer weapons in the country, which could ultimately result in a Nobel peace prize for Hillary Clinton. Only this time, naturally, it won’t be just a fictional recognition. Unlike Obama, President Clinton will actually be given a plaque,” Kaine concluded.

21989,Sean Spicer Promotes ‘Bollard Wall’ Fencing to Satisfy Budget Critics,"President Donald Trump did not get funding for his wall in the recent budget agreement with Democrats, but the White House is arguing that they did get funding for “wall” fencing. [In a debate with Breitbart News, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer claimed that Republicans did get funding for a “wall,” pointing to existing photos of fences with bollard style steel construction and “levee walls. ”  “That is called a bollard wall,” he said to Breitbart News, pointing to photos he displayed on a screen. “That is called a levee wall. ” Spicer refused to describe his fence photos as Trump’s promised wall, but assured them that it would be effective in protecting the border. He told reporters that the fencing was endorsed by DHS Secretary John Kelly. Kelly has proposed large bollard fencing to help secure the border, although he has also supported the idea of “a concrete wall” on the border. “There are places along the border, and I would offer to you, down in the southern Rio Grande valley, where a wall, a concrete wall, makes all the sense in the world,” he told Bloomberg News in April. “There are other places where a   wall, say a large bollard, if you will, fence, makes a lot of sense. ” The House budget agreement specifically cites funding for “border fencing” and “steel bollard designs,” not a wall, after Democrats insisted that money for border security would not be used to fund Trump’s wall.  Page 739 of the House budget agreement refers to “border fencing” and “steel bollard designs,” not a wall  &gt https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) May 3, 2017,  On the campaign trail, Trump assured supporters that he was not building a fence, but an actual wall of hardened concrete. “It’s going to be made of hardened concrete and it’s going to be made out of rebar and steel,” Trump said to a child in Manassas, Virginia during a rally in 2015. In a January interview with Sean Hannity, President Trump mocked existing “little toy walls” on the Southern border and said “I don’t know why they even wasted their time” on building them.

21990,Central Park Five Take Out Ad Supporting Death Penalty For Donald Trump,"Topics: Donald Trump , rape , Sexual Assault , advertisement Friday, 4 November 2016 This is the full page anti-Trump ad the Central Park Five and Amal Fae Susy paid for in the Daily News this week. 
In a surprising twist the men who were coerced as teens into making a false confession of rape are now openly calling for the death penalty to punish Donald Trump. The Central Park Five have even taken out an ad in the Daily News, the same newspaper where Donald Trump placed a full page ad supporting the death penalty for them. 
Amal Fae Susy, the unknown sixth member of the Central Park five spoke out against Trump at a community day festival in Brooklyn. 
""I for one am angry over the time I lost in prison after being wrongfully convicted when I should have been living my life. And meanwhile he [Trump] called for the death penalty for us while he was the one sexually assaulting women at the time. Well, fair being fair, Donald Trump should get a taste of his own medicine and be subject to the death penalty for sexually assaulting all of those ladies."" 
Susy's attorney, Chabot Sanders of the international law firm Sanders and Cassandro spoke to the press after Susy's remarks. 
""My client Mr. Susy is speaking to the inequalities inherent in the US justice system. Mr. Susy and the Central Park Five, all black men, were rounded up, tried and convicted, all on completely false charges--and we know this for certain because along with DNA evidence exonerating these men, the real rapist has confessed--any evidence used against my client and the Central Park Five has failed any kind of real scrutiny over time."" 
""Meanwhile, a rich powerful white man like Donald Trump, an admitted serial sexual assaulter, he's bragged about it, and even his victims have said that he assaulted them in exactly the same way he described when he was caught on tape. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is walking free? It defies logic."" 
Donald Trump for his part went ballistic after the ads came out and fired off tweets till five in the morning. He threatened to sue the six men and the Daily News, and he even launched a new conspiracy theory saying that Hillary Clinton had something to do with getting the men released. 
At five a.m. Trump tweeted these: 
Donald J Trump @realDonaldTrump Wow, if crooked Hillary doesn't have a time machine then she cooked this all up decades ago to make me look bad during the 2016 election. 
Donald J Trump @realDonaldTrump These Central Park rapists are some bad playas, they confessed and got off when crooked Hillary paid someone else to confess to their crime. 
The Spoof's own legal analysts have said it's unlikely Donald Trump will ever face any jail time for sexually assaulting women because, you know, he's a rich white man. Make XRhonda Speaks's  ",0
21992,Ancient mosque inscription confirms Jerusalem Temple,"November 3, 2016 Ancient mosque inscription confirms Jerusalem Temple 
The Mosque of Umar, located in the village of Nuba, about 16 miles south of Jerusalem, is believed by locals to have been built by Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, under whose rule Arab armies conquered Jerusalem and the rest of Byzantine Palestine in the mid-7th century, reported the Times of Israel. His successor, Abd al-Malik, the fifth caliph, built the better-known Dome of the Rock atop the Temple Mount in A.D. 691. 
A recently studied limestone dedicatory plaque in the Nuba mosque describes the village as an endowment for the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, but what is notable is it refers to the Dome of the Rock as “the rock of the Bayt al-Maqdis” – “Holy Temple” – the literal translation of the Hebrew term used by early Muslims for the city of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount’s gold-dome shrine. 
The stone bearing the inscription sits above the mosque’s niche that faces toward Mecca. 
It reads: “In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate, this territory, Nuba, and all its boundaries and its entire area, is an endowment to the Rock of Bayt al-Maqdis and the al-Aqsa Mosque, as it was dedicated by the Commander of the Faithful, Umar ibn al-Khattab for the glory of Allah.”",0
21994,The Sad Evolution Of Education Summed Up By One Meme,"You are here: Home / US / The Sad Evolution Of Education Summed Up By One Meme The Sad Evolution Of Education Summed Up By One Meme October 26, 2016 Pinterest 
Robert Gehl reports that the City of Portland has come up with a genius idea to get America’s schoolchildren back on track. 
With our nation’s educational system in shambles and our students doing worse and worse compared with other nations (worse than Slovakia? ), school officials have decided to ban homework. 
That’s the big plan from folks whose city has the most strip bars per capita and whose motto is: “Keep Portland Weird.” 
The plan – to ban all homework in elementary schools – went into effect with the start of school this week. 
Instead, OregonLive reports , here is what the school tells students to do with their free time: “Cuddle with your parents. Play board games with your siblings. Pick up a favorite book to read or be read to. Run around and be as active as you can.” 
Officials claim that giving young kids homework doesn’t help their test scores at all … 
Why ban homework? A team of teachers at Cherry Park Elementary in the David Douglas school district in East Portland dug into the research and found that, while high school students learn more when they do homework, for elementary pupils, there is little to no evidence homework does any good. 
But further down, we discover the true motive behind their homework ban: Racism . 
Principal Kate Barker says assigning regular homework isn’t a fabulous idea at any elementary school, but especially not at Cherry Park, where at least 75 percent of students live at or below the poverty line and families speak more than 30 different languages. 
“We find that homework really increases that inequity,” Barker said. “It provides a barrier to our students who need the most support.” 
That’s right. They’re not saying homework doesn’t help. What they’re saying – and trust me, I’m a teacher – is that homework doesn’t help poor people (they mean minorities) and that if it doesn’t help poor people, then nobody should do it. 
The truth is that lower-income families have less time to spend with their children – making sure they do their homework, helping them with it. So fewer of the lower-income, minority kids do it. 
So rather than find a way to get these parents to spend more time helping their kids, they’re giving up and just banning homework altogether. 
Barker says the school will carefully monitor if students are making enough academic progress and will tweak things if they are not. But making better use of the school day, not assigning homework, will be the strategy if change is needed, she said. 
Teachers got on board with the no-homework policy once the rationale was explained, Barker said. Parents have been 100 percent in favor of the change. 
And the students? They, she said, “are cheering.” 
And that’s why our school system is failing. 
Keeping Portland weird. Weird and stupid.",0

Regan Pifer writes that the problems with utopian leftist policies–err, visions–is that they are just that: utopian policies. 
Once they dismount their unicorn and stop eating their calorie-free cupcakes and talking to their centaur friends, they will realize their grand, utopian visions simply do not work. 
The most recent abysmal failure of the utopian Left, Obamacare, received another significant blow this past week. 
According to International Business Times : 
At least 1.4 million people from 32 states could lose their health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, as their plans are set to disappear from the program next year. They will have to find new coverage in a market that will likely have fewer options and higher prices, Bloomberg reported Friday. 
The coverage losses come after Aetna and UnitedHealth Group, as well as some regional insurers, announced they plan to leave Obamacare’s markets in 2017 and instead offer individual coverage outside of the program’s exchanges.That means there will be fewer, but more expensive, plans, and the same doctors and hospitals people used before may not be included under the Affordable Care Act, regulators and insurance customers told Bloomberg. 
Utopian vision: healthcare for all. 
Reality: Americans are fined if they don’t have health insurance. If they do have health insurance through Obamacare, they could lose it. And, it wasn’t that good to begin with. 
See, that’s the problem. Liberals always think the plans will work. 
There will be no bumps, no issues. Where did my unicorn go? 
But as Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini explains, “providing affordable, high-quality health care options to consumers is not possible without a balanced risk pool” and many insurers agree–they’re “having trouble competing in Obamacare marketplaces and making money.” 
It is predicted that for the first time in three years, Obamacare enrollment will shrink in 2017. The potential 1.4 million that will lose their health care next year will have fewer and costlier options. 
Michael F. Cannon, a health policy expert at the Cato Institute, summed it up nicely: “the ongoing and nationwide exodus of insurers is just the latest piece of evidence that Obamacare is a failed law built on false promises.”

22004,Sanctions Damage Russian Economy but Don't Work as Political Tool - Ex-Minister,"Western Sanctions Against Russia ( 649 ) 0 42 0 0 Western sanctions damage the Russian economy but do not work as a political tool, a former Russian finance minister said. 
KRASNAYA POLYANA (Russia), (Sputnik) — The sanctions imposed on the Russian economy cost the country up to 1 percent of the GDP growth every year but they do not work as an instrument of political influence, former Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said Wednesday. ""Russia bears significant expenses because of the sanctions. I always mention the figure from 0.8 percent to 1 percent of the GDP growth that is not achieved… annually. That's why the words that the sanctions are insignificant are not true. They have a significant impact on our economy, growth and living standards,"" Kudrin told reporters. 
The former minister added at the same time the sanctions were not effective as a political tool. ""It is another matter that [the sanctions] as the political tool do not function, do not work. I agree with this. It has not influenced our policy at all,"" Kudrin added. 
Following the the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, the European Union and the United States accused Moscow of meddling in Kiev’s internal affairs and imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia, as well as decreasing the general level of cooperation with Russia.

SAF sent Breitbart News a statement on the attack: Today’s shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise ( ) and others including an aide and two Capitol Police officers is the result of Democratic hate speech toward President Donald Trump and majority Republicans, the Second Amendment Foundation said today. “This hate speech that has been going on since Donald Trump was elected,” said SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb. “It gets their voter base agitated and this is what happens as a result. Is this just a coincidence this happened on the president’s birthday?” The gunman has been identified as James Hodgkinson of Illinois. A Facebook page belonging to the   suspect suggests that he was a socialist Democrat, and was a follower of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders confirmed that Hodgkinson was apparently a volunteer in his 2016 presidential campaign. “When liberal leftists support the assassination of President Trump on stage what do you expect to happen,” Gottlieb stated. “Hate speech and actions incite this kind of violence. It is time for Democrats like Reps. Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton and many of the talking heads at CNN and MSNBC to shut up. ” SAF also observed: Congressman Scalise and others at the field this morning were lucky to have the protection of courageous Capitol police officers, the good guys with guns who took down a bad guy with a gun,” he continued. “But what if they hadn’t been present?” Congressman Mike Bishop of Michigan, who was at the baseball field, told a reporter, “The only reason why any of us walked out of this thing, by the grace of God, one of the folks here had a weapon to fire back and give us a moment to find cover. ” “Maybe now the   rights Democrats will support everyone’s right to carry a firearm for ” Gottlieb said. “We are the first line of defense when it comes to personal protection from crazed individuals. ” Breitbart News spoke with SAF’s Alan Gottlieb about the calls for more gun control that have already been made in reaction to the shooting. He responded, “Democrats should ban their hate speech, not our guns for  . ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

22009,Canadian Conservatives Elect New Leader to Stand Against Trudeau,"Toronto, CANADA  —   The Conservative Party of Canada have elected former Speaker of the House Andrew Scheer as their new party leader in a close leadership race that was determined by less than one per cent. [After months of campaigning by 13 different candidates, the Conservative Party of Canada has selected former youngest ever Speaker of the House Andrew Scheer as the leader of the Tories and the official opposition. Thousands gathered in Toronto to vote in a preferential ballot system that saw Scheer beat libertarian favourite Maxime Bernier.  The leadership conference began with a speech from interim leader Rona Ambrose who took over party leadership after the resignation of former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2015. Ambrose talked about her various battles with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in parliament and touted the party’s success in getting the Trudeau government to recognise the genocide against the Yazidi people by Islamic State. The preferential ranked ballot system went through a total of 13 rounds before a victor could be declared. After the first round, libertarian Quebec MP Maxime Bernier held the lead. Breitbart London spoke to Mr. Bernier who said at the time he felt confident but “nervous” and said: “We don’t know what will happen. ” Breitbart London also spoke to supporters of candidate Kellie Leitch who had been referred to as the “Trump of Canada” by many media outlets in the country during her campaign for being tough on issues of immigration and migrant integration. The supporters did not reveal a favourite amongst the top candidates but said they were confident Ms. Leitch would continue to raise the same issues she campaigned on in parliament. After the preferential ballot counting eliminated all but the two top candidates, Andrew Scheer pulled ahead of Bernier by only half of a per cent. The results were announced to cheers from the thousands in attendance and Scheer himself took the stage. In his brief speech, Scheer, aged 38, making him younger than Trudeau and newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron, said he would get rid of the unpopular carbon tax enacted by the Liberal government and slammed Trudeau for being more focused on   than on the concerns of Canadian families. Scheer also said that as prime minister he would resume Canada’s involvement in fighting Islamic State in the Middle East. Shortly after becoming premier in 2015, Justin Trudeau ended Canada’s military participation in air strikes against the terror group. The new conservative leader also had no qualms in stating that he would combat “radical Islamic terrorism” in Canada and across the globe.",0
22011,DIY Self Watering Tomato Buckets,"Tomatoes are probably the most versatile plant you can grow. Make your own self watering Tomato Buckets and never water your tomatoes again. 

Many people know about growing tomato plants in 5 gallon buckets. Turning these buckets into self watering buckets creates tomato plants that are practically maintenance free. Imagine growing full tomato plants and only having to refill a reservoir once a week. This trick also saves space! 

How It Works 

The process is actually very simple. Tomatoes are planted in a wicking medium that draws water from below and sends it to the roots of the plant. The water is drawn from another drum or garbage can and is released by a float valve. The valve that irrigated your plants is activated when the water level drops. 

You can also grow peppers, okra, cucumbers, and more with this system. 

The next important aspect of this design is the fabric grow bag you will be using. You can use simple grocery bags spun out of polypropylene. You can also find grow bags at your nursery and garden supply stores. The porous fabric allows excess water drainage and aeration of the root zone which is necessary for optimal growing conditions. 

This is system is also based on the principle of “air root pruning”. As roots grow out to the porous fabric, they become exposed to air, dry out, and die. This causes the plant to produce dense fine feeder roots and prevents root circling. The increase in fine feeder roots leads to better nutrient and water absorption and promotes accelerated plant growth. 

You will also need a plastic kitchen colander that will hold the fabric shopping bag off of the bottom of the bucket and create a shallow water reservoir in each grow bucket. Trim any large plastic colander to fit inside a 5 gallon bucket. 

Next you will need a 5 gallon support bucket with holes around the sides for ventilation. The bucket will help support the fabric bag and the ventilation holes will allow adequate air movement. This will allow oxygen to reach the root zone which is essential for optimal plant growth. The bucket also acts as a water reservoir below the bag providing a water source for the wicking grow medium. By maintaining the proper water level with the float valve regulator the medium will never dry out and will continuously wick moisture up to the root-zone.",0
22012,NYT: Trump Changed the Party of Reagan to the ‘America First’ Party,"In a New York Times   R. R. Reno explains how Donald Trump has redefined the Republican Party from its   conservatism to its new populist, nationalist “America First” focus. [As Reno notes, the old Reagan Republican orthodoxy was focused on “small government, an internationalist foreign policy, free trade, and moral and religious conservatism. ” That orthodoxy defined the establishment agenda of Republican politicians, conservative columnists, and Beltway think tanks for decades. But the rise of Trump has “revolutionized” the Republican Party and changed “the very terms of the American political divide. ”  From Reno’s New York Times  : [A]s Mr. Trump recognized, the new schism in American life is not about big versus small government, or more or less regulation. It is about immigration, free trade and the broad and deep impacts of globalization on America’s economy and culture. “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,” he told the Republican National Convention. It is obvious to all but the most blinkered Republicans that with or without Mr. Trump, the Reagan era is over. The   and   consensus has been exploded. The next smart, ambitious young Republican politician with national aspirations will not adopt Ted Cruz’s strategy of trying to revive the rotting flesh of Reaganism. He will read out of Mr. Trump’s playbook, attacking globalism rather than big government. And he’ll win, because he’ll be talking about what worries voters.   …     Over time, however, that iteration of Republican conservatism became less salient, in large part because it won. In 1989 we saw the fall of the Berlin Wall. Soon after, Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over. Barack Obama bailed out Wall Street, promoted the further extension of free trade and was a cheerleader for Silicon Valley billionaires. By 2016, only a thoroughly catechized conservative believed Democrats were strangling economic freedom. Democrats have also assumed a large piece of the libertarian mantle, especially when it comes to sexuality and drugs.   …     Mr. Trump’s shocking success at the polls has done our country a service. Scholars may   about the historical connotations of “America First,” but the basic sentiment needs to be endorsed. Our country has dissolved to a far greater degree than those cloistered on the coasts allow themselves to realize. The once vast and unifying middle class has eroded over the last generation. Today we are increasingly divided into winners and losers. This division involves more than divergent economic prospects and income inequality. Globalism is an ideology of winners who stand astride our society as it is being remade by dramatic economic, demographic and cultural changes. Read the rest here. ",0
22014,Carrie Fisher Laid to Rest in Prozac Pill Urn,"The late Hollywood actress Carrie Fisher was laid to rest Friday alongside her mother, actress Debbie Reynolds  —   and photographs taken at the funeral revealed the Star Wars actress’ ashes were placed in an urn shaped like a Prozac pill. [estoy fascinada con la urna de carrie fisher: tiene forma de prozac. que manera de entender todo. pic. twitter.   —   diva virtual (@ValeriaLugosi) January 7, 2017,   The private service at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles was attended by celebrity friends and the family of the   Hollywood royalty, with Meryl Streep reported to have delivered the eulogy. The funeral followed a private memorial service at Reynolds’ and Fishers’ Beverly Hills estate. Photos taken at the funeral showed Fisher’s brother, Todd Fisher, carrying the actress’s ashes in an urn shaped like a Prozac pill. “Carrie’s favorite possession was a giant Prozac pill that she bought many years ago. A big pill,” Todd Fisher told Entertainment Tonight after the service. “She loved it, and it was in her house, and Billie and I felt it was where she’d want to be. ” Fisher also said there would likely be a public service for the actress at some point in the near future. During her life, Fisher spoke openly of her struggles with mental illness. She revealed she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 24, and said she had received electroconvulsive shock therapy and medication for treatment. Reynolds died at the age of 84 just one day following the death of her daughter, who passed away four days after suffering a heart attack on an airplane. The mother and daughter had been estranged at various times during their lives, but grew especially close in recent years and had lived next door to each other. An HBO documentary about their relationship, Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, is set to premiere on the premium cable channel on Saturday.

22024,’Grey’s Anatomy’ Star Jesse Williams: Trump a ’Pig’,"Actor and activist Jesse Williams accused President Donald Trump of intentionally dividing the country along racial lines and called him “a pig” in an impromptu interview this week. [Asked by TMZ “how Trump is doing with racial injustice” in America, the Grey’s Anatomy actor replied: “He’s not. ”  “He’s a pig who’s trying to make sure that he galvanizes as much fear as possible, particularly against black, brown immigrants, and Muslims,” Williams told TMZ. Concerning Trump’s law enforcement policy agenda, Williams cited a series of   shooting statistics. “There were more killings at the hands of police this February than January and February of last year, 211 murders at the hands of police this year so far,” the actor said.  Williams has spoken out against Trump before. In September, the actor and activist appeared in Joss Whedon’s “Important” political PSA alongside Avengers stars Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson to urge people to vote for former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Last year, the actor was the subject of a petition calling for his firing from Grey’s Anatomy following his   acceptance speech at the BET Awards, during which he vilified police officers and accused white people of appropriating and then profiting from black culture. Williams also protested in Ferguson, Missouri after the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. He later said on CNN’s State of the Union that “there’s a complete double standard and a complete different experience that a certain element of this country has the privilege of being treated like human beings, and the rest of us are not treated like human beings, period. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson",0

Yale College Republicans barbecuing by union fast site pic. twitter.   —   gabrielwinant (@gabrielwinant) April 28, 2017,  The hunger strike concerned Yale’s unwillingness to negotiate a contract with its graduate teachers, who voted to unionize in February. The union, known as Local 33, is a subgroup of the international labor union UNITE HERE. The university’s refusal is currently being appealed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) with the university reportedly hoping to hold out until Donald Trump appoints a new batch of   members to the NLRB. Asked about his reaction to the barbecue, Local 33 Chairman Aaron Greenberg told The New Haven Register, “I’m not really focused on that. I’m focused on making sure we have lots of water, make sure I’m healthy. We have a check in with our nurse this afternoon. We are focused on that. ” In fliers distributed before the strike, the organizers asked others to participate with them in solidarity, urging people to “sit with us and lift our spirits,” and “[join in] when one of us cannot continue. ” Greenberg also attacked the university for “siding with Donald Trump over members of their own community” by taking an   stance. “I think that is unacceptable. I think that is despicable. They say we have to wait, so we are waiting without eating,” he said. You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
22027,"Украина пугает Европу ""призраком России""","0 комментариев 0 поделились Фотоархив Правды.Ру 
В беседе Кулеба рассказывал о ""несомненных победах"" Украины на европейскому пространстве, о поддержке позиций Киева европейскими политиками ""которые совсем не устали от украинских проблем"" и о том, что ""все партнеры Украины сейчас оказались перед простым выбором: подыгрывать россиянам либо помогать украинцам"". 
Конечно, вопрос взаимоотношений ПАСЕ и России стороной украинский дипломат обойти не смог. 
""Хотя формально никакого пункта, связанного с Россией, в повестке дня не было, её призрак бродил в зале ПАСЕ. Обсуждали резолюции по Украине и постоянно говорили о России. Выступали президент Франции Франсуа Олланд и министр иностранных дел Германии (Франк. - RT ) Вальтер Штайнмайер и тоже говорили о России"", - заявил Кулеба в интервью Gordon.ua. 
Напомним, как сообщала Правда.Ру, в январе 2017 года Россия может вернуться в Парламентскую ассамблею Совета Европы, но на особых условиях, главное из которых - восстановление всех прав нашей делегации. Чтобы ситуация двухгодичной давности с лишением России права голоса не повторилась, наши депутаты предложили внести изменения в регламент ПАСЕ. Инициатива может быть рассмотрена на декабрьской сессии ассамблеи. 
В начале сентября глава Пар­ла­ментс­кой ас­самб­леи Со­ве­та Ев­ро­пы Педро Аграмунт заявил , что в ходе совместных встреч с главами ведущих политических групп в Москве хотел бы обсудить возобновление диалога с Россией. 
В 2014 и 2015 годах ПАСЕ приняла резолюцию, в которой лишила Россию права голосовать на сессии, права участия в работе уставных органов и в мониторинге выборов. После этого Москва решила не направлять в Ассамблею документы, необходимые для подтверждения полномочий делегации. 
Ситуацию для Pravda.Ru прокомментировал Павел Подлесный, руководитель Центра российско-американских отношений Института США и Канады. 
""Во-первых, Россия из ПАСЕ де-юре не выходила. Мы ушли с определенной сессии, а самой ассамблеи не покидали. Просто пока делегация не возвращается на заседания. Сомневаюсь, что Россия рассчитывала на то, что такой шаг окажет какое-то отрезвляющее воздействие на остальных членов ПАСЕ. 
Во-вторых, ничего нового в действиях ПАСЕ нет. Такие резолюции принимались в прошлом, будут приняты и сейчас. И я убежден, будут приниматься и в будущем. Как надо нам к этому относиться? Дальше бойкотировать заседание или изменить свою позицию? 
""Я должен сказать честно, что этот вопрос сейчас не актуален. Потому что над этим уже будет думать новое руководство Государственной думы, новый состав. А представители Южной Осетии, Абхазии, ДНР и ЛНР как хотят, так пусть и реагируют. Это, честно говоря, никакого значения не имеет в принципе"", - отметил в интервью Правде.Ру эксперт.

China will invest 946.3 billion yuan ($140 billion) by 2020 to relocate its poorest citizens from remote, inland regions to more developed areas, the state planner said on Monday. 
The mass relocation is part of a strategy to lift 10 million people out of poverty by 2020, with 2 million estimated to be moved this year, the state council said in May. 
The funds will be used mainly to construct homes, support facilities and basic public infrastructure, with the rest going to the restoration of vacated lands, state planner National Development and Reform Commision (NDRC) said in a document. 
READ MORE: CHINA BETS BIN ON NUCLEAR FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE 
The investment will be financed mainly by China's two policy banks - China Development Bank and Agricultural Development Bank of China, who will provide 341.3 billion yuan in long-term loans and 50 billion yuan in construction bonds - as well as by local governments, who will provide 285.8 billion yuan. 
Local governments will also raise up to 100 billion yuan through bonds, while the central government in Beijing will allocate around 80 billion yuan. Relocated villagers are expected to contribute 21.5 billion yuan. 
China's poor make up about 5 percent of a population of 1.4 billion, living mostly in the countryside and earning less than 2,300 yuan a year, according to the government and state media. 
More than 12 million people were moved in earlier relocation efforts as of the end of last year, the NDRC said.

22032,"Bones Aboard South Korean Ferry Stir Hope, Then Anguish, in Relatives - The New York Times","SEOUL, South Korea  —   Hopes rose and then were crushed on Tuesday when South Korean officials reported, and then retracted, the finding of human bones from the ferry Sewol, which sank nearly three years ago, killing more than 300 people. When officials announced at a news briefing that they had found what they “believed were the bones of a missing person,’’ relatives of the nine passengers still missing, who have never given up hope of finding the remains of their loved ones, broke into tears. But hours later, the authorities withdrew the announcement. In a brief statement sent to journalists, they said that the bones were not from a human but from “an animal. ’’ Some local news reports said the bones belonged to a pig. Hopes of recovering the missing passengers have risen since the   ferry was finally lifted from the sea bottom last Thursday. The Sewol, structurally unbalanced and overloaded, capsized and then sank off the southwest coast of South Korea on April 16, 2014. The underwater search of the ferry ended after divers recovered the 295th body, a   girl, from one of the ship’s restrooms on Oct. 28, 2014. After the ferry was raised last week, it was positioned on its side on a large   vessel as salvage crews drained it before taking it to a nearby port for a closer inspection. On Tuesday, they found six bones, a shoe and other personal items, which had apparently washed out of the ferry as it was being drained. Government forensic experts were sent to the scene to collect the remains. Most of the victims were students from Danwon High School in Ansan, south of Seoul, who had boarded the ferry for a trip to an island. The nine who are still missing include four students and two teachers from the school. The sinking, one of the country’s worst disasters, was a deeply traumatizing experience for South Koreans. When the Sewol capsized, its crew members were among the first to flee, after repeatedly telling passengers to stay in their cabins. As the ship slowly went under, teenagers trapped inside sent text messages begging for help or saying goodbye to their families. Confusing news reports and official announcements at the time added to South Koreans’ pain over the disaster. Local news outlets initially reported that all on board the Sewol had been rescued. And the government kept releasing conflicting information on the number of people on board and the number of those rescued. Bereaved families had demanded that the ship be salvaged, hoping that the bodies of the missing would be found inside. “ ! Hang in there just a bit more, so we can go home together,” Lee   said in tears on Tuesday, throwing yellow roses into the sea. Her daughter, Cho   a Danwon student, was one of the nine missing. Around the time the bones were found, Ms. Lee and others with missing relatives joined emotional religious services on a boat near the Sewol, during which Catholic pastors, Protestant ministers and Buddhist monks prayed for the recovery of the nine’s remains. “Please support us until I can hold my daughter’s hands and finally go home,” said Park   the mother of another missing student, Heo   according to pool reports by South Korean journalists at the scene. Ever since the ferry’s sinking, relatives of the missing have camped out at a nearby pier, in hopes that their loved ones’ remains would eventually be found. On Tuesday, friends and supporters of the families gathered there and released yellow balloons into the sky wishing for a successful recovery.",0

Thursday’s verdict came after a month long trial over the occupation and standoff which lasted for nearly six weeks — and left one member of the militia dead. The defense had argued that it was not a conspiracy, but rather a peaceful protest.
“Ammon Bundy, the group’s de-facto leader, was charged, along with six followers, with theft of government property, possession of a firearm on a federal facility and impeding federal officers through threats, force, or intimidation,” Sputnik News reports.
The jury found the defendants not guilty on all charges except one, which they were deadlocked on.

Harney County Judge Steve Grasty had estimated that the standoff was costing the county “$60,000 to $70,000 a day” for security costs and closed schools. Additionally, federal taxpayers are on the hook for cost accrued by the Bureau of Land Management’s district office in Burns, which employs nearly 120 people, most of whom were placed on paid administrative leave. The weekly cost of their salaries was $117,000 per week, or $3,400 per day.
One of the members, LaVoy Finicum, 54, was killed by police after allegedly pulling a gun on officers who had pulled over the vehicle he was in.
“I have been raised in the country all my life,” Finicum told the press before his death. “I love dearly to feel the wind on my face. To see the sunrise, to see the moon. I have no intention of spending any of my days in a concrete box.”
Twenty-six other militants were arrested in relation to the takeover. The rest of the defendants are scheduled to stand trial in February 2017.
The armed group had claimed to be protesting what they believed to be unconstitutional policies regarding federal land management, and a dispute between the Hammonds, a local ranching family.
The Bundy’s had previously made global headlines after engaging in an armed standoff with federal agents over land in Nevada.

22037,Sessions: ’I Did Not Recuse Myself From Defending My Honor Against Scurrilous and False Allegations’ - Breitbart,"During his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated his recusal from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, “does not, and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI,” and that “I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations. ”  Sessions said, “[T]he scope of my recusal, however, does not, and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, which has an $8 billion budget and 35, 000 employees. I presented to the president my concerns and those of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about the ongoing leadership issues at the FBI, as stated in my letter recommending the removal of Mr. Comey, along with the deputy attorney general’s memorandum on that issue, which have been released publicly by the White House. Those represent a clear statement of my views. I adopted the Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein’s points that he made in his memorandum and made my recommendation. It is absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render the attorney general unable to manage the leadership of the various Department of Justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations. ” Sessions added, “Finally, during his testimony, Mr. Comey discussed a conversation that he and I had about the meeting Mr. Comey had with the president. I’m happy to share with the committee my recollection of that conversation that I had with Mr. Comey. Following a routine morning threat briefing, Mr. Comey spoke to me and my chief of staff. While he did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the president, apparently the day before, Mr. Comey expressed concern about proper communications protocol with the White House and with the president. I responded, he didn’t recall this, but I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and the Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House. Mr. Comey had served in the department for better than two decades, and I was confident that he understood and would abide by the   rules limiting communications with the White House, especially about ongoing investigations. That’s what’s so important to control. My comments encouraged him to do just that, and indeed, as I understand it, he, in fact, did that. Our Department of Justice rules on proper communications between the department and the White House have been in place for years. Mr. Comey well knew them. I thought and assumed correctly that he complied with them. ” He concluded, “I recuse myself from any investigation into the campaign for president, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
22041,"In the First 19 Days of October, Trump Gave Just $31K to His Own Campaign","By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 9:19 am With the election just 10 days away, Trump has only donated just $56m of the $100m he promised and won't even invest in his own campaign Share on Twitter Print This Post 
You have got to wonder if the Trump campaign wishes it had spent less on hats and more on polling now, as it is revealed they had only $16M left in their war chest on October 19 compared to Clinton’s $62M. Probably not. There are always others to blame and Trump’s list of those plotting against him grows in inverse proportion to his polling numbers. 
From June 2015 through September 2016, the Trump campaign, meaning Donald Trump, spent $3.2m on hats according to FEC filings . They spent just $1.8m on polling. Unsurprisingly, they are behind on polling, leading in precisely ZERO (0) polls . You want to win an election? You need sweet hats"" -Abraham Lincoln 
Trump has spent more on hats than direct mail or polling… pic.twitter.com/4TOf5DQ1MQ

And now Clinton has four times the cash. 
And The Washington Post is reporting that in the first 19 days of October, Trump only raised half as much as Clinton according to campaign finance reports. His biggest day was the $11.5 million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released, which tells you all you need to know about his base. 
Remember when Trump claimed he would give $100m of his own money to his campaign? Yeah, this is a guy who won’t even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia. He uses other peoples’ money for that. With the election just 10 days away, he has only donated $56m. 
Make what you will of this, but he had been giving $2m a month to his campaign. In the first 19 days of October? Just $31k in in-kind contributions. That’s right: even Trump won’t invest in his own campaign at this point. 
Trump pulled in $61m up to October 19, down from $100m in September. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign has pulled in a cool $101m in that same period. She spent less than normal, $54m, but that leaves her a war chest of $153m going into the final stretch. 
Donald Trump says he is a great businessman, yet he has spent twice as much on collateral (including hats) as he has on paying his staff. He says he gets only the best people. And he bought a lot of his #MAGA hats. His campaign site only sells 18 different styles of hat at $20 to $30 apiece. 
And according to Huffington Post , The October 15 Federal Election Commission filing for Trump Make America Great Again Committee shows Trump spent $300k of donors money to buy his own book – presumably The Art of the Deal. He profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments, and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the $22 book at $184 each. 
His campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters, yet Trump told a crowd in Geneva, Ohio that “Hillary Clinton has never earned an honest dollar, well I think that’s really, you know…” 
Trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the White House while turning a personal profit. 
Now it looks as though Trump has seen a point of diminishing returns. He not only did not self-fund his campaign as promised, he has barely spent half of what he said he would spend, down to almost nothing at all as defeat looms and the potential for profit evaporates.

Would have been more ironic if that had been a US TOW missile supplied by the Pentagon to ISIS recently. 
Recently read that the Abraham M1A2's armour (Chobham type) is near impenetrable with most tank and RPG rounds so it's weird that this one sliced through it and cooked the lid off the thing. cowdiddly Oct 26, 2016 5:16 PM 
Those Abrams tanks have been cooking off like popcorn all over the world with both Kornet and Tow missles especially the Saudis losing lots of them. I think Iraq/perrsmerga said they lost about 4 around Mosel just yesterday alone. 
They ain't looking real exceptional at the moment. If its any consolation neither have any other tanks when up against this stuff. 
The only one I have seen yet to be able to survive them is the russian T-90. Any earlier than that like the T64 and T-72 have same problems because of the ammo being placed inside the operators compartment and this was moved in the T-90. I have seen 4-5 of these take direct hits and survive. 
Also some tanks wiht homemade slat armor mave made it but not many. GoldRulesPaperDrools

By Liz Zabel 
Millions of U.S. military servicemen and women have returned to civilian life after serving in the armed forces, and while serving in the military is challenging, many returning veterans find reintegrating even more difficult. 
In fact, according to research published in the Journal of Psychiatric Services, rates of depression and other mental disorders are high among services members within their first year returning from deployments. 
It’s not just a change of scenery, after all. Returning also means a change in job duties or a new career, living arrangements, lifestyle and more. 
“When you go into the military, you are stripped down mentally, so the person you were before the military is no longer,” said Laura Boddicker, a Navy veteran originally from Tennessee now living in Newhall.

22054,This DIY Dandelion Strawberry Drinking Vinegar is Delicious and Healthy,"Dandelion roots are tenacious and normally thought of as nasty weeds that destroy lawns. 

Yet herbalists love dandelions as a food and medicine. Their long roots dig deep into the earth and pull vitamins and minerals into the plant. Fresh dandelion roots have a sweet and slightly bitter taste and they make great nutrient-dense food. 

Herbalists use dandelion roots to support liver health. Since it improves liver function, the root has many other benefits that stem from this. It can help eradicate symptoms associated with poor liver health, including acne, boils, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). 

How to Harvest 

Dandelions are small herbaceous perennial plants that grow in disturbed soils, from lawns to gardens to farms to roadsides to abandoned lots. 

When harvesting dandelion roots for eating, be sure to harvest them in an area that has not been sprayed with herbicides or insecticides. Harvest away from areas that are likely contaminated with pollutants (don’t harvest dandelions from roadsides). 

Look for dandelions with good clumps of leaves because this will mean that they will have large roots. 

When using dandelion root for medicine, it is good to harvest them in the fall. However, these roots are fine to use any time of the year and still offer a plethora of health benefits. 

Harvest the roots with a digging stick and dig around the outermost edges of the leaves to loosen the soil. Avoid cutting into the root. Once the soil is sufficiently loosened, reach down to gently break up the soil and free the root. If the root is still firmly attached to the soil and you pull too firmly, you will break the root. 

If the leaves of the roots you are harvesting are young, you can use them in salads of put them in a pesto. 

Be sure to wash your roots well before using them in this recipe. 

Submerge them in a bowl of water and stir the water.",0

22060,Where Fountain Pens Are Saved and Sold - The New York Times,"If your definition of a fine writing instrument is a plastic ballpoint with a smiling tooth and your dentist’s address printed along its side, then a visit to the Fountain Pen Hospital in Lower Manhattan might be revelatory. In its quiet interior, away from the bustle of Broadway, you can browse and try any of the thousands of fountain, rollerball or   ballpoint pens behind its glass cases. That includes a classic fountain pen like the $935 Montblanc Meisterstück, with an elegant gold nib and a piston ink filler inside its black barrel. Or collector bait like the   Krone, which, at $3, 920, features a portrait of Benjamin Franklin and, in its cap, a piece of one of his lightning rods. Or you can try the $55 Parker IM that writes so fluidly and precisely it seems capable of elevating not just your penmanship but also the thoughts you put on the page. James Hutchinson, a salesman known as Jimmy at the store, described a fountain pen’s effect: “It slows you down. It makes you think about what you’re writing. ” The Fountain Pen Hospital represents a bygone idea in an age of instant communication, but it still draws people from across New York City to its storefront at 10 Warren Street. Terry and Steve Wiederlight, who are brothers and the current owners, have watched the business established by their grandfather and father in 1946 ebb and flow through the industry’s sea changes. After ballpoints hit the mass market in the 1950s, the store expanded to all manner of office supplies. When big chains like Staples began to swallow up that business in the ’90s, the Wiederlights returned to their roots, selling and repairing pens from 40 brands, including Aurora, Dupont and Waterman, as well as vintage finds. Most of their business is now through online sales, but they are among the last fountain pen sellers in the city that do repairs and carry replacement parts and ink. They remain a destination for pen connoisseurs. On a recent Thursday morning, a gentleman came looking for a refill for his Caran d’Ache ballpoint. A doctor from Montreal bought a rollerball with a skeleton on it to delight his students back home. Daniel Boggiano popped over from his office in the Woolworth Building to pick up four vintage pens the store had repaired. His wife had inherited them from a   who clearly had impeccable taste. “They have a tremendous sentimental value to my wife,” he said, though the pens have little monetary worth. Mr. Boggiano’s tastes run more modern  —   he likes an   Benchmade or a vanishing point fountain pen  —   so he asked a salesman, Marvin Kujawski, to show him how to replace the ink in a marbled green,   fountain pen Mr. Kujawski had identified as a Parker Challenger from the late ’30s. “Very simple,” said Mr. Kujawski, 62, who has worked at the store for 23 years. “You press the button down, you put it in the ink and let it go. ” His partner behind the counter that day was Marilyn Brown, 83, who had owned a competitor to this store, Arthur Brown  Brother in Manhattan. She closed it almost four years ago because its monthly rent had become exorbitant, she said. But Ms. Brown said retirement didn’t much suit her. “I called Terry and said, ‘How would you like a part timer? ’” To attract the younger generations, Ms. Brown contends, stores like this one must convey the message that a pen is also a mark of style. When a person at a meeting “unscrews the top of a fountain pen,” she said, “everyone looks to see what he’s doing that puts him one step above. ”",0
22061,Comment on Khizr Khan Specializes in Programs SELLING US Citizenship by Thomas Moloian,"Trump: ""I'm Afraid the Election is Going to be Rigged"" LewGD 
I seriously doubt that disgusting “grieving” Paki father do rely grieves after his son. I would rather say POS is milking his “grievance” and his “sacrifice”. Sacrifice he is babbling about is not HIS sacrifice but the one from his son eventually. The son lost his life in the war staged by Bush & Co and supported by Hillary, and hypocrite bastard father never raised a word against these people. Instead motherfucker accuses Trump who was against the war that caused “his sacrifice”. 
In Iraq, American Soldiers and Marines have been dragged in an Imperial expeditionary war, where too many lost their lives unnecessarily, particularly those riding infamous Humwees, known as widow makers. In such war neither families nor war fighters sacrificed anything. Families have been robbed of their sons and sons have been robbed of their lives. 
Scumbag Paki layer also said how he would never be in the US if it would depend on Trump. He “forgot” to say that if he would never have immigrated to the US, his son would never go in that war and his son would be alive. It’s obvious that Paki Turd is making business from his “grieving”. He made deal with the (((Satanic))) Mafia, hence his soul is black, not Trump’s. 
If he would be sincere with this he would rather raise questions long time ago why Soldiers and Marines were sent in the war in Humvees to be blown off almost the same way as if they were riding bicycles. Mother of killed Seal in the Benghazi addressed Hillary directly as a prime culprit. 
Apart of this, RNC made bad decision having their convention prior of DNC. It was stupid move, or maybe intentionally “stupid”, if we take in consideration relations within GOP camp. 
Trump should be very careful in his reactions now, he better find himself a gang of extra-cunning advisers to fend off rotten scoundrels from Hillary’s (((Mafia))). It is an imperative because too many ordinary voters are total political idiots. Until now, (((Democraps))) managed to fool recklessly naive and politically dumb UNDECIDED voters. 
Trump should stop reacting as a Bull on a red flag on every provocation. His stormy temper would cost him his presidency. If Trump loses, America loses, Amurkistan wins and Europe becomes Eurabia.

22064,"EPA’s Scott Pruitt Follows Through on Promise to Meet with Governors, Re-establish Trust - Breitbart","Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt met with eleven Western Governors at a breakfast on Sunday, honoring a promise he made during his confirmation hearings and at CPAC on Sunday to reach out to state governments to   trust. [“There’s distrust right now that exists between the states and Washington, D. C. as it relates to the environment,” Pruitt told the crowd at CPAC on Saturday.  “We need to do what we can to restore trust. I’m going to be spending time   …     with the state governors and the executive branches of [state] government   …     I’m going to send a message. Let’s join    to do what’s important for the environment,” Pruitt said. Less than   hours later, Pruitt held the meeting with Western Governors, who appeared to welcome the dialogue. The governors of nineteen western states are members of the Western Governors Association. “The Western Governors Association wants a better state and federal partnership,” Governor Steve Bullock of Montana, current chairman of the group, said in a statement released by the EPA. “I look forward to working together with the Western Governors on issues unique to the Western States and with each of these Governors on issues important to their individual states,” EPA Administrator Pruitt said. “These Governors and their states are great stewards of their natural resources. They want to protect their water and air and grow their economies. The Environmental Protection Agency is going to help them do that,” he added. “In his first week on the job as EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt has now met with 18 Governors and Lieutenant Governors, putting into action his promise of an open door policy and a new beginning of partnership with the states,” the EPA said in its statement. Last week, the Western Governors Association sent a letter to the EPA’s Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, “reiterat[ing] concerns” over a propsed rule, Financial Responsbility Requirements under CERCLA for Classes of Facilities in the Hardrock Mining Industry. “Many western states rely on the hardrock mining industry for economic development and employment,” the governors wrote: These states have staff dedicated to mine permitting and compliance. Such staff are committed to ensuring hardrock mining facilities are designed, constructed and operated in a manner that minimizes risks to the environment and ensures proper site reclamation. “The EPA’s proposed rule   …     will negatively affect state economies,” they continued. “It may also hamper existing, effective state financial assurance programs,” they added. Pruitt’s meeting with the governors on Sunday is the kind of reaching out he intends to conduct with state governments across the country to address and respond to their concerns. Twelve members of the group met with Pruitt on Sunday. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper did not participate in the breakfast, but was in attendance in other meetings. Of the twelve members of the Western Governors Association who met with EPA Administrator Pruitt, seven are Republicans ( Governor Doug Burgum (N. D.) Governor Butch Otter (Idaho)  Governor Mary Fallin (Okla.)  Governor Brian Sandoval (Nev.) Governor Gary Herbert (Utah) Governor Dennis Daugaard (S. D.)  Governor Matt Mead (Wyo.) ). Four are Democrats ( Governor John Hickenlooper (Colo.) Governor Kate Brown (Ore.) Governor Steve Bullock (Mont.) and Governor David Ige (Hawaii) ) and one member, Governor Bill Walker (Alaska) is an independent. The seven members of the Western Governors Association who missed the meeting with Pruitt included five Republicans (Governor Doug Ducey (Arizona) Governor Sam Brownback (Kansas) Governor Pete Ricketts (Nebraska) Governor Susanna Martinez (New Mexico) and Governor Greg Abbot (Texas) ) and two Democrats (Governor Jerry Brown (California) and Governor Jay Inslee (Washington).",0
22067,Trump Appoints Religious Liberty Defender Roger Severino to Head HHS Office for Civil Rights - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump has appointed freedom of conscience and religious liberty defender Roger Severino to head the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). [Severino, the former director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at the Heritage Foundation, has been especially known for his criticism of Obamacare’s “nondiscrimination” regulations on the basis of “gender identity. ” The guidelines propose to penalize healthcare professionals who are morally and professionally opposed to sex change surgeries and treatments.  Severino and Ryan Anderson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, observed in a report in 2016 that Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) provides guidelines that “force many physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers to participate in   surgeries and treatments, even if it violates their religious beliefs or their best medical judgment. ” “Moreover, because they apply so broadly, the regulations propose to also force employers, individuals, and taxpayers to fund coverage for such procedures even if doing so conflicts with their sincere beliefs,” Severino and Anderson added. “It’s a super appointment. Roger Severino is a very balanced thinker who is also an experienced litigator,” said Family Research Council senior fellow Ken Blackwell, according to LifeSiteNews. Blackwell added Severino, who also worked as CEO and legal counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, is “associated with some of the best thinkers in the area of civil rights policy. ” LGBT rights advocates criticized Severino’s appointment. “I could not think of a more dangerous person to head up the Office of Civil Rights at HHS,” JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president of policy and public affairs at the Human Rights Campaign said, according to Yahoo. “Once again, Donald Trump is declaring war against our community by appointing   people at all levels of his administration. ” “The Office for Civil Rights at HHS is essential to ensuring that all people can lead healthy lives, free of discriminatory barriers,” said Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, adding, “Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which bans discrimination based on race, sex, disability and age in health programs and activities, is key to achieving this goal. Strong and experienced leadership at OCR committed to fully enforcing Section 1557 is therefore critical. Mr. Severino is not that leader. ” Henderson added Severino’s appointment is “part of a disturbing trend by the Trump administration of naming people who disagree or outright oppose the mission or role of an agency or office to leadership positions within those entities. ” Writing at the Daily Signal last year on the issue of North Carolina’s bathroom privacy policy, Severino asserted, “The radical left is using government power to coerce everyone, including children, into pledging allegiance to a radical new gender ideology over and above their right to privacy, safety, and religious freedom. ”",0
22068,"After Peres, Is Peace Possible in the Middle East?","  
The death of former Israeli president and prime minister Shimon Peres last week marks the last of the Zionist “old guard” who successfully fought for a UN mandate to establish the state of Israel in what was formerly British Palestine. Much has been written about Peres since his death. He was a peacemaker. He was a warrior. He was brutal. He was complex. It is possible for all of them to be accurate at the same time. 
Was Peres a warrior? That is without question. Israel was established in bloodshed and Peres played an important role in that fight. Also, the brutal Israeli attack on a Palestinian refugee camp at Qana in 1996 took place under Peres’s command. In that attack more than 100 women and children were killed. 
But history, and especially Middle East history, can be quite complex. Shimon Peres was above all in favor of trying to find a way for Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side. He was right there in spirit when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had a famous 1993 handshake with Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat. Rabin paid for his efforts with his life, as a right-wing radical assassinated him in 1995. 
Shimon Peres was in favor of real negotiations with the Palestinians and he several times inserted himself into the process to urge the hawkish Benjamin Netanyahu to start talking rather than saber rattling. In 2012, for example, Peres made it known again that he favored a two-state solution and that Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas was a suitable negotiating partner. He also urged Netanyahu to open up direct talks with Hamas if certain agreements could be made beforehand. 
But perhaps his greatest move to avert war only came known with his passing. Former Jerusalem Post editor Steve Linde wrote a fascinating article last week in his old newspaper detailing a meeting he and the Post’s managing editor had with Shimon Peres in 2014. According to Linde, Peres was asked what he thought was his greatest legacy. He replied that he had personally intervened to stop Netanyahu from ordering a preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear sites. Asked by the journalists when they could report this revelation, Peres responded, “when I’m dead.” So it came to pass last week. 
How much for the worse things have become in Israeli-Palestinian relations with the passing on of anyone preferring negotiations to violence. There is little interest among current Israeli leadership to take steps toward negotiation or peace. Innocent Israelis and Palestinians will continue to be killed and injured as long as no compromises are considered. Sadly this position is reinforced in Washington, where the Obama administration just agreed to grant Israel the largest military aid package in US history. 
There is much to admire in those who work for peace, even those with stains on their record. I remain convinced that Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts would be much closer to bearing fruit if the US government would stop inserting itself into the process and subsidizing either side. Left alone, both sides would likely produce more leaders interested in ending bloodshed and conflict.",0
22069,Rusia e India avanzan en el contrato de sistemas antiaéreos S-400 Triumf,"Rusia e India avanzan en el contrato de sistemas antiaéreos S-400 Triumf   22:10 GMT 
Moscú y Nueva Deli también colaboran en proyectos de construcción de helicópteros y tienen en marcha un programa de fabricación de buques de guerra. Sistema de misiles antiaéreos S-400 de alcance medio-grande Triumf Kirill Kallinikov Sputnik   
Las autoridades militares de la India y Rusia han avanzado en varios proyectos conjuntos, incluyendo en las negociaciones sobre los sistemas de defensa aérea S-400 Triumf, señaló este miércoles el ministro de Defensa ruso, Serguéi Shoigú, en la 16.ª reunión de la comisión intergubernamental ruso-india para la cooperación técnico-militar. 
""Observo con satisfacción los progresos en nuestros grandes proyectos como la construcción conjunta de helicópteros Ka-226, sistemas de misiles BrahMos [misiles de crucero] y sistemas de defensa aérea S-400 Triumph"", dijo Shoigú citado por RIA Novosti . 
Según el ministro, está en marcha un gran programa especial de construcción de buques de guerra, incluyendo submarinos. 
Shoigú ha indicado que las partes ya han empezado a negociar algunos puntos del futuro contrato, en particular los relativos a cuestiones de entrega y servicio de posventa y garantía. 
Hasta el momento, Rusia es el único operador de este sofisticado sistema de defensa aérea, pero en 2015 se firmó un acuerdo con China para vender los S-400 al gigante asiático, que se convierte en el primer país extranjero en comprar estos complejos. 
El S-400 Triumf es el más avanzado sistema antiaéreo de las Fuerzas Armadas rusas. Las capacidades de este sistema permiten detectar y atacar cualquier objetivo aéreo –ya se trate de un avión o de un misil balístico– en un radio de 400 kilómetros.  ",0

22073,Ellison: I Hope People Protest in the Streets Against ’Cruel’ New Travel Ban - Breitbart,"Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” while discussing President Donald Trump’s new executive order limiting travel to the United States from six   countries, Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) said it was “cruel, it’s wrong, and it’s the same beef stew warmed over,” adding, “I hope people use their First Amendment right to express their opposition by protesting in the streets. ”  Partial transcript as follows: ELLISON: It’s the old Muslim ban lawyered up a little bit, but the intent is the same, the basic impact on people will be very similar. It takes off one country. Interestingly enough, if you look at acts of terrorism committed in the United States and the country of origin, of the people who committed those acts, the top ones are Saudi Arabia, UAE and Egypt. None of them are on that ban. But you do have Somalia, a lot of my constituents hail from there, a massive famine and drought. People will die, are dying and yet they are being excluded. It doesn’t make any sense. It’s cruel, it’s wrong, and it’s the same beef stew warmed over. I expect the same effect will happen in the courts because he said he campaigned on a Muslim ban, within days after his inauguration, he went forward on that Muslim ban and he made a few tweaks but it’s still the same thing. MITCHELL: I know we’ve had reporting that Rachel Maddow did exclusively last week, which showed that from the intelligence unit inside Homeland Security, there is evidence that the children of refugees and of other immigrants come here and are not radicalized, that in fact  —   ELLISON: Right. MITCHELL: And the parents are not radicalized. When people get radicalized, it’s more than a decade later from their experiences here in the United States. So there’s no intelligence justification for   extreme vetting according to these documents. ELLISON:  That’s right. Well, people are vetted pretty extremely already. People wait in refugee camps for 18 months, 24 months. This is not the problem. This really is a political move designed to satiate his base who believes that there is things to fear out there from refugees. The truth is that this is nothing but demagoguery by the president and it’s sad. And I hope people use their First Amendment right to express their opposition by protesting in the streets and writing letters and talking to their members of Congress. I hope that people really do stand up and say this is not what we believe our America is, and we believe in an inclusive America that welcomes immigrants and refugees. And that of course we’re going to be as safe, but at the same time there’s no reason to whip up unnecessary fears, as the president’s trying to do. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
22074,"Strange signals coming from deep in space 'probably' aliens, scientists say","Tue, 25 Oct 2016 21:09 UTC © Terry W. Virts / NASA Scientists have heard hugely unusual messages from deep in space that they think are coming from aliens. A new analysis of strange modulations in a tiny set of stars appears to indicate that it could be coming from extraterrestrial intelligence that is looking to alert us to their existence. The new study reports the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 2.5 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky. The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely. And there appears to be no obvious explanation for what is going on, leaving the scientists behind the paper to conclude that the messages are coming from aliens. ""We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,"" write EF Borra and E Trottier in a new paper. ""The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis,"" the two scientists from Laval University in Quebec write. The research has appeaed in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific , under the title 'Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars'. It appears to have been originally suggested for publication with the name 'Signals probably from Extraterrestrial Intelligence', according to a pre-print version of the paper hosted online . But they make clear that further work will need to be done to confirm or deny that hypothesis. That will need to be done by watching for the same signals on different equipment so that all other explanations can be discarded. Breakthrough Listen - an initiative set up this year to look for alien life and supported by people including Stephen Hawking and Mark Zuckerberg - said that the message was promising. But they said that further work will have to be done before they can be ""unequivocally attributed"" to aliens. ""The one in 10,000 objects with unusual spectra seen by Borra and Trottier are certainly worthy of additional study,"" the team said in a statement. ""However, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. ""It is too early to unequivocally attribute these purported signals to the activities of extraterrestrial civilizations. Internationally agreed-upon protocols for searches for evidence of advanced life beyond Earth (SETI) require candidates to be confirmed by independent groups using their own telescopes, and for all natural explanations to be exhausted before invoking extraterrestrial agents as an explanation. ""Careful work must be undertaken to determine false positive rates, to rule out natural and instrumental explanations, and most importantly, to confirm detections using two or more independent telescopes.""

22076,"North Korea’s Test of Rocket Engine Shows ‘Meaningful Progress,’ South Says - The New York Times","SEOUL, South Korea  —   North Korea’s latest test of a rocket engine showed that the country was making “meaningful progress” in trying to build more powerful rockets and missiles, South Korean officials said on Monday. North Korea said on Sunday that it had conducted a ground jet test of a newly developed   missile engine, which its leader, Kim   called “a great event of historic significance. ” Using the characteristic bombast of such announcements, he said that the test heralded “a new birth” of the country’s rocket industry and that “the whole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries. ” The North’s rival, South Korea, acknowledged on Monday that the test represented a breakthrough. Lee   a spokesman at the Defense Ministry, said it showed that the North was developing a more sophisticated rocket engine. The model that the North tested included a cluster consisting of a main engine and four vernier thrusters  —   smaller engines used to adjust the craft’s velocity and stability. “Through this test, it is found that engine function has made meaningful progress,” Mr. Lee said during a news briefing, without divulging further details. He declined to say whether the engine was for a rocket used to place a satellite into orbit or for an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, which the North has been threatening to   any time. Mr. Lee said more analysis was needed to answer that question. Mr. Kim has called for his country to develop and launch “a variety of more working satellites” using “carrier rockets of bigger capacity. ” The country has also renovated and expanded the gantry tower and other facilities at the launch site to accommodate more powerful rockets. The United Nations Security Council has banned the country from satellite launchings, considering its satellite program a cover for developing an intercontinental ballistic missile. The test of the rocket engine took place at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground in   in northwestern North Korea, where the country  fired a carrier rocket in February of last year to place its Kwangmyongsong, or Shining Star, satellite into orbit. After that launch, South Korean defense officials said that the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds  —   far enough to reach most of the United States. In September, North Korea conducted the ground test of what it called a new   rocket engine in   days after it conducted its fifth underground nuclear test. Although the North has never   an ICBM, it has recently demonstrated significant progress in its missile programs. Last month, it launched a new type of   ballistic missile that it said could carry a nuclear payload. That missile, the   uses a   technology that American experts say will make it easier for the country to hide its arsenal in its numerous tunnels and deploy its missiles. Since Mr. Kim took power in 2011, North Korea has launched 46 ballistic missiles, including 24 last year, violating resolutions by the United Nations Security Council that ban the country from developing or testing such weapons, according to South Korean officials. In his New Year’s Day speech, Mr. Kim said his country was in the “final stage” of preparing for its first ICBM test. In Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Friday, Rex W. Tillerson, the United States’ secretary of state, said that two decades of international efforts to end the North’s nuclear weapons and missile programs had failed. He warned that all options should be on the table to stop them, including possible   military action.",0

22085,The Russia-Microsoft CyberWar is Underway,"The Russia-Microsoft CyberWar is Underway November 02, 2016 The Russia-Microsoft CyberWar is Underway 
Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday that a hacking group previously linked to the Russian government and U.S. political hacks was behind recent cyber attacks that exploited a newly discovered Windows security flaw. 
The software maker said in an advisory on its website there had been a small number of attacks using ""spear phishing"" emails from a hacking group known Strontium, which is more widely known as ""Fancy Bear,"" or APT 28. Microsoft did not identify any victims. 
Russia is not just sitting back. On Wednesday Putin basically banned Microsoft and the business service LinkedIn from operating in the country, according to NBC News : 
In his battle with the United States, Vladimir Putin has a new target — Microsoft. 
The Kremlin is backing a plan to rid government offices and state-controlled companies of all foreign software, starting with Moscow city government replacing Microsoft products with Russian ones, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official. 
The Russians have also moved toward blocking LinkedIn, the U.S.-based networking site that Microsoft is in the process of buying. The company is appealing an injunction, with a decision expected Nov. 10. 
Microsoft's disclosure of the new attacks and the link to Russia came after Washington accused Moscow of launching an unprecedented hacking campaign aimed at disrupting and discrediting the upcoming U.S. election. 
The U.S. government last month formally blamed the Russian government for the election-season hacks of Democratic Party emails and their subsequent disclosure via WikiLeaks and other entities. Russia has denied those accusations. 
Microsoft said a patch to protect Windows users against the newly discovered threat will be released on Nov. 8, which is Election Day. It was not clear whether the Windows vulnerability had been used in any of the recent U.S. political hacks. 
Representatives of the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security could not immediately be reached for comment. 
A U.S. intelligence expert on Russian cyber activity said that Fancy Bear primarily works for or on behalf of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency, which U.S. intelligence officials have concluded were responsible for hacks of Democratic Party databases and emails. 
In spear phishing, an attacker sends targeted messages, typically via email, that exploit known information to trick victims into clicking on malicious links or open tainted attachments. 
Microsoft said the attacks exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Systems Inc's Flash software and one in the Windows operating system. 
Adobe released a patch for that vulnerability on Monday, when security researchers with Google went public with details on the attack. 
Microsoft chided rival Google for going public with details of the vulnerabilities before it had time to prepare and test a patch to fix them. 
""Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,"" Microsoft said. 
A Google representative declined to comment on Microsoft's statement. 
Google disclosed the flaw on Monday, following its standing policy of going public seven days after discovering ""critical vulnerabilities"" that are being actively exploited by hackers. 
Google gives software companies 60 days to patch less serious bugs. Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?

22087,Thanksgiving at Standing Rock,"( Flickr / CC 2.0 ) 
I’m currently reading a book entitled “ Learning to Die in the Anthropocene ,” written by Iraq veteran Roy Scranton, who basically tells us that human beings have pretty much screwed themselves due to the vast and rapidly-approaching nightmare of climate change. If this book was designed to scare the holy shite out of people, it certainly has succeeded. 
According to Scranton, “Human civilization has thrived in what has been the most stable climate interval in 650,00 years. Thanks to carbon-fueled industrial civilization, that interval is over.” Boom. 
But is anybody doing anything to stop this nightmare from happening? Only a few people are—mainly a small-but-courageous Indian tribe at Standing Rock, North Dakota. And what is America’s reaction to this heroic stand against death by carbon? We have just spent hundreds of thousands of tax-payer dollars trying to tear-gas them, harass them, arrest them, pepper-spray them and shoot rubber bullets at them. Way to go America! Or not. 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Thank goodness for the Standing Rock Sioux. Like it or not, they are protecting us. They are standing in place instead of us. They are bravely standing in front of a hurricane of climate-death and are doing it in our name. And all we do to thank them is to pay for the militarized police’s tear gas, dogs and bullets that attack them. 
I propose another way to thank the Standing Rock Sioux. Let’s all go to Standing Rock this Thanksgiving—and show them that we really do have something to be truly thankful for. 
PS: If you can’t figure out how to get all the way to the Standing Rock Reservation, then consider having your Thanksgiving dinner in front of the Capitol building in Bismarck instead. Can’t make it there either? How about Thanksgiving dinner in front of the US Congress or the White House. 
PPS: Standing Rock protestors, Black Lives Matter, various Chicano movements and Occupy are practically the only true Americans these days—Americans who are courageous enough to actually stand up to the US military-industrial complex that is gobbling up the rest of us alive. We should honor these protestors instead of bombing them with tear gas and attacking them with dogs. 
The rest of us whine and grieve that we are losing everything—but do nothing to stop it and just go along. 
PPPS: Aside from being victims of the climate-change hurricane that is now bearing down upon us post-haste, Standing Rock is also just more collateral damage right now (along with Syria, Palestine, Ukraine, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Nigeria, etc.) in the neo-con “wars” for oil. But who knows who the next “collateral damage” will be? Probably us.

22088,Oscar Plans Are Back On for Syrian Subjects of Nominated Films - The New York Times,"The Syrian stars of two   films will travel to the Academy Awards after all, representatives said, now that President Trump’s travel ban has been lifted. Raed Saleh  —   the leader of a Syrian civilian rescue group and a subject of the documentary short that bears the group’s name, “The White Helmets”  —   will be on the red carpet and attend the ceremony on Feb. 26. With him will be his fellow rescuer Khaled Khatib, who also worked as a cinematographer on the film, which has been nominated for best documentary short. Financed by Western governments, the White Helmets have saved the lives of more than 75, 000 Syrians, pulling them from the rubble of   buildings and administering emergency first aid. Hala Kamil, a Syrian refugee and mother of four now living in Germany, will also be attending the awards now, too. Mrs. Kamil and her children fled Syria after her husband was kidnapped by the Islamic State. Their ordeal is captured in “Watani: My Homeland,” which is also up for best documentary short. In a statement, Mrs. Kamil said she would be attending the ceremony with a heavy heart, as she and her husband, who is presumed dead, made a ritual out of watching the Oscars each year. “But to be reminded of what I have lost is also a reminder of what I have held on to: my children,” she said. The filmmakers of both documentaries said they had always intended to bring their subjects to the Oscars. But those plans were upended when Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month banning visas for travelers from seven   countries, including Syria. This month, federal courts blocked the ban, though Mr. Trump suggested at a news conference on Thursday that he might issue a new order next week. Mr. Khatib, the cinematographer, is hurrying to get on a flight to the United States before another potential travel ban. Attending the Oscars, Mr. Khatib said in a statement, would help not only broadcast the urgency of Syrians’ plight, but also bring hope to his beleaguered countrymen back home. “I do this work because I believe if the world understands the suffering of my people, they will be moved to stop it, to stand with us on the side of life,” he said. “The White Helmets have a motto taken from the Quran: ‘To save a life is to save all humanity. ’”",0
22089,Russian Minister of Economy arrested: A Cold Shower for Liberals and Oligarchs,"November 15, 2016 - Fort Russ - Ruslan Ostashko, PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


It’s impossible not to laugh and feel pity when looking at those who in the media and on social networks are now saying that the arrest of [Russian Economy Minister] Ulyukaev [for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe] was made possible exclusively thanks to the telephone conversation between Trump and Putin. According to this conspiracy theory, without Washington’s permission, Putin never ever would have dared lay a finger on Ulyukaev and only now gathered the wiretap transcripts from many months and years before the American elections. 
Guys, let’s respect our country. We are not Ukraine. Putin and the FSB don’t need a nod from Washington to extinguish corruption. Open the calendar on your computer and look at what year it is. It is 2016 and those who are talking about some kind of permission from Washington are either stuck in 1995 or have confused today’s Moscow with Kiev. There’s no need to be like our neighbors, who to this day think that every day the sun rises only because of the State Department. Washington is not the center of the universe or the world. It’s time to get used to this. 
If you want to find coincidences in time and draw meaningful conclusions from them, then I have a better proposal. Today, November 15th, the leader of the FSB of Russia, Alexander Vasilevich Bortnikov, is celebrating his 65th birthday. I wish him every success in his hard work. If someone  wants to come up with conspiracy theories, then the arrest of Ulyukaev should at least be attributed to this special day and not some kind of phone call with Trump. Judging by the hysterical statements of the American supporters of Clinton, even Trump’s election would not have been possible without the active support of Russian intelligence. 
We will never know if this is actually true, but I suggest that we not make any excuses. It’s really quite cool when the Western propaganda machine speaks of the omnipotence of the immortal KGB. 
And there’s no need to write off the arrest as a fight between clans within the country’s elite. Of course, there are clans and they are waging a tough fight against one another, but it is unlikely that any clan would like a situation in which anyone can be jailed regardless of their rank, position, and merit. After Ulyukaev’s arrest, it turns out that nothing, no position, gives immunity from justice. This situation is not beneficial for any clan. And it is becoming all the more clear that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin is the driving force of the process of fighting against bureaucratic corruption.  
And finally, look at how warped various representatives of the non-systemic opposition and the pseudo-liberal media are. Just yesterday they were screaming on social networks about how everything is bad and terrible, corruption is everywhere, and no one is jailing senior officials. Well, last night they arrested Ulyukaev. Security forces are saying that they caught him red-handed. And what reaction do we see in the blogosphere and media? Cries about 1937, massive Putinist repressions, a disaster for the economy and the ruble, the night of the long knives, etc. I feel that soon this will be followed by calls to pay and repent. Ulyukaev has all the chances to become a prisoner of conscience and Khodorkovsky will stand in up in support of him. This is pathetic. 

The new year is coming soon. I would like to make the wish that we’ll find a sane opposition under the Christmas tree or on new year’s eve. We’ll handle corruption and roads in one way or another.

22092,Musik statt Lärm: Erster Laubbläser mit eingebauter Trompete vorgestellt [mit Video],"Freitag, 11. November 2016 Musik statt Lärm: Erster Laubbläser mit eingebauter Trompete vorgestellt [mit Video] Bochum (dpo) - Laubbläser sind nicht gerade für ihr angenehmes Betriebsgeräusch bekannt und sorgen so immer wieder für Frust und Nachbarschaftsstreit. Doch derartige Probleme dürften bald der Vergangenheit angehören: Ein Hersteller aus Bochum hat mit dem ""Miles Davis 3000"" ein neuartiges Modell vorgestellt, bei dem eine Trompete so in das Gerät verbaut ist, dass statt lästigem Surren und Rauschen fröhliche Musik ertönt. Chefentwickler Roger Fähnrich erklärt, wie es zu dieser Erfindung kam: ""Alle Versuche, leisere Laubbläser zu konstruieren scheiterten, weil es technisch unmöglich ist, den durch Blasgeschwindigkeiten von bis zu 300 Stundenkilometern erzeugten Lärm zu dämpfen."" Daher habe man sich nach Wegen umgesehen, das Geräusch ""umzuleiten"". ""Ein Kollege, der privat in einer Jazz-Big-Band spielt, hatte dann die zündende Idee"", so Fähnrich. ""Er brachte eine alte Trompete mit und baute sie in den Blasschlauch ein."" Der Prototyp des 'Miles Davis 3000' war geschaffen. Statt nervtötendem Laubbläserlärm erzeugt das Gerät nun eine fröhliche Melodie. Im Einsatz klingt das dann so: Erste Kunden sind begeistert: ""Mein Nachbar hat mich für meinen Laubbläser gehasst. Wenn ich den 'Miles Davis 3000' anwerfe, macht er das Fenster auf und wippt fröhlich mit. Mittlerweile sind wir die besten Freunde"", berichtet Friedrich Geffner (51). Die Euphorie ist so groß, dass sich inzwischen bereits erste Laubblasorchester bilden. Kein Wunder, dass den Bochumer Gartenmaschinenhersteller immer mehr Anfragen erreichen, ob es auch möglich wäre, andere Blasinstrumente wie Saxophon, Tuba und Blockflöte einzubauen. Ein australischer Kunde habe gar den Einbau eines Didgeridoos angefragt. ""Wir arbeiten daran"", so Fähnrich. Auch wenn erste Tests mit der Tuba sich im Alltagsbetrieb als wenig praktikabel erwiesen, da aufgrund der erzeugten Vibrationen mehr Blätter von den umliegenden Bäumen fielen, als weggeblasen werden konnten. ssi, dan; Idee: ari ; Bildmaterial: Shutterstock Artikel teilen:",0

Clinton, who was promoting her book “She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World,” told   Savannah Guthrie she found a voice during the campaign and thought it was necessary “not to stay silent now” given the political climate. “Well, last year when I was campaigning for my mom  —   I think really up until my due date with Aidan and then being on the stage at the convention so proud to support her there just a few weeks after he was born  —   I did so many events for my mom,” Clinton said. “And I had a chance to share my thoughts publicly in those forums. I did lots of interviews. And now I continue to share my views after the inauguration. ” “I don’t think what I say today is any different than what I would say had I been asked similar questions or similar issues kind of on the stage,” she continued. “But certainly, I think we all have a responsibility to not stay silent now.

According to the professor, authorities in Europe are generally   in the fight against Islamist attacks, but he stressed that security services need to keep a closer eye on people deemed to be a potential terror threat. As well as boosting the resources and capacity of   bodies, Neumann said it’s vital that intelligence agencies leave no threat file unprocessed. “You need to have a concrete, integrated, systematic approach to prevention,” he added. Speaking after the Westminster attack in March  —   in which Muslim convert Khalid Masood mowed down crowds with a vehicle and stabbed a police officer, killing five people and injuring more than fifty  —   the ICSR chief said that nations in Europe are going to have to learn to live with terror. “Just because nothing happens for two months doesn’t mean the risk of a terror attack being carried out has declined, and this is something we need to adapt to,” he said. Neumann pointed out that while   agencies in Britain are far superior to those in most of Europe, the problem is that they don’t currently have enough resources to deal with the huge number of threats.",0
22096,Physicists Leak Evidence That Supports Elon Musk’s Theory – The Universe Is A Simulation,"We Are Change 
Physicists say they may have evidence that the universe is a computer simulation. How? They made a computer simulation of the universe. And it looks sort of like us.
A long-proposed thought experiment, put forward by both philosophers and popular culture, points out that any civilization of sufficient size and intelligence would eventually create a simulation universe if such a thing were possible.
And since there would therefore be many more simulations (within simulations, within simulations) than real universes, it is therefore more likely than not that our world is artificial.
Now a team of researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany led by Silas Beane say they have evidence this may be true.
In a paper named ‘Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation’ , they point out that current simulations of the universe – which do exist, but which are extremely weak and small – naturally put limits on physical laws.
Technology Review explains that “the problem with all simulations is that the laws of physics, which appear continuous, have to be superimposed onto a discrete three dimensional lattice which advances in steps of time.” 
Read also: Scientists Believe They Have Discovered A Parallel Universe That Interact With Our World! 
What that basically means is that by just being a simulation, the computer would put limits on, for instance, the energy that particles can have within the program.
These limits would be experienced by those living within the sim – and as it turns out, something which looks just like these limits do in fact exist. For instance, something known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin, or GZK cut off, is an apparent boundary of the energy that cosmic ray particles can have. This is caused by interaction with cosmic background radiation. But Beane and co’s paper argues that the pattern of this rule mirrors what you might expect from a computer simulation .
Naturally, at this point the science becomes pretty tricky to wade through – and we would advise you read the paper itself to try and get the full detail of the idea.
But the basic impression is an intriguing one.
Like a prisoner in a pitch-black cell, we may never be able to see the ‘walls’ of our prison — but through physics we may be able to reach out and touch them.

22098,"UK in ’Front Seat’ for US Trade Deal, Top Republicans Confirm","Following Brexit, the UK will be in the “front seat” for a new trade deal with the U. S. under the Trump administration, senior Republicans have confirmed. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker made the declaration after meeting British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who said he was confident the UK would be “first in line” for such a trade deal, the BBC reports.  The strong statements come after outgoing President Obama travelled to the UK during the European Union (EU) referendum campaign to threaten the British people that they would be at the “back of the queue” for a deal if the voted to Leave. Mr. Corker said Mr. Johnson knows “full well” that “there is no way the United Kingdom is going to take a back seat”. “They will take a front seat and I think it will be our priority to make sure that we deal with them on a trade agreement initially but in all respects in a way that demonstrates the   friendship that we’ve had for so long,” he said. . @BorisJohnson joins us in Washington to discuss   @realDonaldTrump and the future of the #SpecialRelationship. pic. twitter.   —   British Embassy (@UKinUSA) January 9, 2017,  “Clearly, the Trump    has a very exciting agenda of change,” Mr. Johnson added. “One thing that won’t change though is the closeness of the relationship between the U. S. and the UK. “We are the number two contributor to defence in NATO. We are America’s principal partner in working for global security and, of course, we are great campaigners for free trade. “We hear that we are first in line to do a great   deal with the United States.

22100,Social Justice Warriors Have Become a Trendy Demographic for Advertisers - Breitbart,"Advertisers have begun appealing to the social justice wing of liberalism in an attempt to increase sales, according to the Guardian. [The Guardian reports that advertisers are using social justice related advertising campaigns to appeal to liberals across America. One ad celebrating “ ” comes from a very unusual source, the car company Kia. In the ad, actress Melissa McCarthy is driving in a Kia car when she gets a call to “save the whales,”   In an ad for the home rental app Airbnb, a message flashes across the screen reading, “We believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong. ” The video was shared across social media with the caption, “acceptance starts with all of us. ” Acceptance starts with all of us. #weaccept pic. twitter.   —   Airbnb (@Airbnb) February 6, 2017,  These ads are examples of a growing trend within advertising which seeks to appeal to liberal demographics. The Guardian spoke to urbanist Richard L Florida who thinks that the ads are representative of a divided country with advertisers catering to voting groups often based on location alone. As richer people became more liberal, advertisers began attempting to appeal to those with the largest wallets. “Advertisers used to wonder how a spot would play in Peoria,” says Florida. “Now they wonder how it would play in Brooklyn. ” Rob Baiocco, a creative executive at BAM Connection who has produced ads for major brands such as Pringles and Starburst, believes that many of these ads are “highly suspect” in their aims, often pretending to care about social issues to appeal to liberal millennials without really bothering to research the issue whatsoever. “Companies are avidly and aggressively trying to get involved in a socially responsible space, and they are doing it horribly  —   they are grabbing at straws. They are entering a complex conversation they have no right to be in, yet they are forcing their way in,” Baiocco said. “These creatives are trying to make their toilet paper save the world. ” “Sometimes a Pringle is just a Pringle. ” stated Baiocco. Sarah   an advertising expert at the University of Southern California, took issue with the faux compassion that many of these ads show. “Empowering girls becomes a product unto itself. That’s commodity activism: there’s no real connection to structural change,” said  . Read the full article in The Guardian here.

22101,8 Members of One Family Found Shot to Death in Rural Ohio - The New York Times,"Eight members of one family were found shot to death in rural Ohio on Friday, including a mother killed while sleeping in the same room as her newborn baby, and the killer or killers were thought to be at large, law enforcement officials said. The bodies of seven members of the Rhoden family were found before 8 a. m. in three houses near each other in southwestern Pike County, the county sheriff, Charles Reader, said. Three children  —   ages 4 days, 6 months and 3 years  —   were found in the houses unharmed, the sheriff said. A few hours later, another family member was found dead in another house a few miles away. Officials said at a   news conference that they could not rule out the possibility that other members of the family might be in danger, and that officers were checking on them throughout the region. “We are advising the family members to be very careful, and take particular precaution,” the Ohio attorney general, Mike DeWine, said. “The individual or individuals who committed this crime obviously are dangerous,” Mr. DeWine said. “We believe they are still at large. ” County officials said some members of the extended family had gathered and were receiving counseling and protection. The dead included seven adults and a    boy officials had said earlier that two of the victims were juveniles. “Each one of the victims appears to have been executed,” Mr. DeWine said. “Each one appears to be shot in the head. ” Asked if investigators had any indication of a motive, he said, “none. ” Officials said it was also unclear when the killings took place. “We have victims who were in bed” when shot, he said. “The one mom was killed in her bed with the    right there. ” At first, officials said they could not rule out the possibility that the gunman was among the dead. But later, Mr. DeWine said, “the preliminary determination has been made that none of the eight individuals committed suicide. ” Officials declined to give the first names of any of the victims. Phil Fulton, the pastor of the nearby Union Hill Church, told local television stations that he knew the victims, and they included a woman, her children and her grandchildren. The state Bureau of Criminal Investigation, part of the attorney general’s office, took over the investigation, and Mr. DeWine said the bureau had sent more than 30 investigators to Pike County. The killings took place in a hilly, sparsely populated area of southern Ohio, about 70 miles east of Cincinnati and a similar distance south of Columbus. Sheriff Reader said the initial call to his office came in at 7:53 a. m. reporting two people dead in a house. When deputies arrived, someone flagged them down and told them to check two other houses nearby. The sheriff declined to say who called his office, or how that person had discovered the killings.",0

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A U.N. expert says junk food is a human rights concern. 
Hilal Elver, the U.N.’s special representative on the right to food, said Tuesday the rise of industrial food production combined with trade liberalization has allowed large corporations to flood the global market with cheap, nutrient-poor foods that force poor people to choose between economic viability and nutrition, effectively violating their right to adequate food. 
“Within the human rights framework, states are obliged to ensure effective measures to regulate the food industry, ensure that nutrition policymaking spaces are free from private sector influence and implement comprehensive policies that combat malnutrition in all its forms,” she said.",0

Taking states that the media has tried to downplay as if Trump has no chance to win them, DML shows how Trump not only has a chance, but predicts he WILL WIN these states, and he backs up his prediction with solid data and facts. 
DML also clarified that the polls are extremely misleading. He said Trump has lit a spark in people who have not voted in decades – some who have never voted – but now they are embracing Trump. These people are not being included in the polls. 
Early voting is also not a true representation of what’s about to happen, because more Democrats tend to show up for early voting, while the majority of Republicans wait until election day. 
WATCH THIS EYE-OPENING VIDEO for a critical state-by-state analysis that proves Trump can easily win the election – then SHARE IT EVERYWHERE! 
**Note: In the video when DML talks about PA voting for Trump, he forgot to mention 100k Democrats in PA switched parties over the past year. In addition, PA saw an eye-popping number of new voters register as Republicans. Combined, PA in this election has 240,000 more Republicans than it did in 2012.

Hillary Clinton has been caught in yet another dirty trick in Wikileaks latest storm of email leaks.
The Democrats were planning to frame Donald Trump as a KGB-Russian agent and Putin puppet since April 2016.
Here’s what Wikileaks email ID 27381 reveals:
We don’t have a ton on Simes, but the pro-Russia stuff ties in pretty well to idea that Trump is too friendly with Putin/weak on Russia
Now what do you say about that? We always knew the accusations were false but now we have the proof. The Democrats are dirty! She is a disgusting filthy witch and a Soros puppet while we’re at puppets!
Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump during the 3rd debate of being a “Putin puppet” but if Trump is a Putin puppet just for wanting to be a friend with Russia and not do war with them, then what is Hillary Clinton to George Soros when she took all those dozens of millions of dollars from him? Her slave? His personal door mat?

22114,Ray Rice to Appear in NFL Social Responsibility Training Video - Breitbart,"After video emerged of Ray Rice punching his   in an elevator, many suspected that Ray Rice would never work in the NFL again. Well, those people got it wrong. [Sort of.  According to Jane McManus, a columnist for espnW. com, Ray Rice has taken part in a social responsibility video that players from all teams will see. Rice told espnW, “We shot a video that just highlights everything that I’ve been talking about   how things happened in my life, how things unfolded. The guys get to hear it from me, how it unraveled. ” “How it unraveled” for Rice, of course, was because of a video. Had the video of Rice knocking his fiancée out never emerged, he would have continued playing in the NFL. This lends no small amount of irony to the fact that Ray Rice now makes his return to the NFL, four years later, in a video. Since Rice left the league, he has advocated strongly against domestic violence. While cynics would contest that the reason for his advocacy stemmed more from his desire to play in the league again, and less from genuine passion about domestic violence, the fact that Rice continues to advocate, long after the time any team even would have considered signing him, strongly suggests that his advocacy is at least partially genuine. Will his advocacy have any effect on steering players away from domestic violence? We’ll have to wait and see. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0

Christian talk show host releases specific prayer less than 24 hours before polls open on Election Day, Hillary's weapons Will Not Prosper! 
Laura Densmore believes Hillary is fully energized by a Jezebel spirit. Just like the original Jezebel, who was all about kingdom building for her husband Ahab, she says Hillary is kingdom building for her husband, Satan himself. The Hebrew Nation Radio host would not be the first or only one to say this. Back in 1992 Bishop Perry Stone believes he received similar word regarding both Hillary and Bill Clinton. More recent claims have also been documented. Densmore points out that the exposure of satanic rituals and ""spirit cooking"" in recent headlines reveal an evil plan to control the United States. She further explains that it fulfills Revelation 17: 1-6, where the mystery Babylon woman ( filled with a Jezebel spirit) is drinking from the golden cup filled with abominations and the filthiness of her whoring, as she gets drunk on the blood of the saints. The prayer released by Densmore is very aggressive and direct in it's requests to The Lord, and she hopes that Christians all over the nation and the world pray and share it even during Election Day.

22121,Re: Are There 4 Million Dead Voters Waiting To Elect Hillary Clinton?,"Dead Coloradans are Lining Up to Vote for Hillary. Is the zombie apocalypse upon us? 
According to a report by the Washington Examiner , 
Local officials in Colorado acknowledged “very serious” voter fraud after learning of votes cast in multiple elections under the named of recently-deceased residents. 
A local media outlet uncovered the fraud by comparing voting history databases in the state with federal government death records . “Somebody was able to cast a vote that was not theirs to cast,” El Paso County Clerk and Recorder Chuck Broerman told CBS4 while discussing what he called a “very serious” pattern of people mailing in ballots on behalf of the dead. 
It’s not clear how many fraudulent ballots have been submitted in recent years. CBS4 reported that it “found multiple cases” of dead people voting around the state, revelations that have provoked state criminal investigations. 
There are dozens of documented examples of dead people voting and they can be found all over the internet. 
One thing is for certain. 
The Clinton operatives seem to believe in the old adage… if you ain’t cheatin’ you ain’t tryin’… On October 1st it was reported “Young Virginia Democrat Andrew Spieles confessed this week to registering 19 dead people to vote for Hillary.” 
You can’t stop these people. You can call the election rigged if you want, but how can we argue with people who have the power to summon the dead? 
When I die, I plan to vote conservative. 
OK, my attempts to be humorous are often lost in an overcrowded sea of stupidity. This would not seem to be the exception. 
The only good Hillary voters are obviously the dead ones , because at least they have plausible deniability. Hey bro, “ I didn’t vote for Hillary — I died in 1960. ”

The shooting happened on the 2900 block of Aspen Meadow around 5 a.m. on Sunday. One of the residents who did not want to go on camera said he was throwing the party with his housemates and was taking fees at the door. RELATED CONTENT Two Teenagers Dead And 17 Injured In Florida Nightclub Shooting 
He said several men he did not know showed up to the home and started a fight with his friends. He said the argument escalated into a shooting. 
He said several people who attended the party captured part of the fight on Snapchat. This later reportedly helped police identify that there were two shooters involved. He said one man had a shotgun and the second man had a hand-gun. 
There were five people who were injured in the shooting. Police said that one injured woman tried to drive to the hospital, but wrecked her car along the way. Jasmine De Hoyos, who attended the party, said there were more than a hundred people at the home. She said she helped one of the victims who got shot in the arm. 
“I kind of applied pressure to the wound to make sure he didn’t bleed out. A couple of his friends were there with us. So, we were trying to keep him calm,” said De Hoyos. 
No arrests have been made and police are still searching for the shooters. 
“I’m kind of sad that this happened in this neighborhood because I like living here. It’s a really good neighborhood. It is what it is, and we’re just going to keep an eye out and try to keep each other’s back,” said Jeremy Collins, another neighbor.

22124,Pope Francis Donates Politically-Incorrect Fossil Fuel to Heat Ukraine Homes,"Ideology has given way to reality as Pope Francis donated tons of   “fuel briquettes” to heat the homes of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine this winter. [As part of the “Pope for Ukraine” initiative, Francis donated more than 2. 5 tons of fuel per displaced family cared for by the parish of the Holy Theotokos in the village of Vilcha. The combustible fuel briquettes reportedly will be sufficient to heat the homes and apartments of more than a hundred resettled families until the end of this heating season and throughout next winter as well.  The politically incorrect gift highlights the   and ready availability of fossil fuels, which were responsible for bringing about the industrial revolution throughout the developed world. The Pope’s gift of fuel, which arrived on March 7, marks the first stage of a humanitarian aid project that will include providing foodstuffs and hygiene products to over a hundred families of IDPs in the Vovchansk district of eastern Ukraine. Pope Francis has been a vocal advocate of clean, renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions. His groundbreaking 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si on care for the environment was the first teaching letter of its sort in the history of the Catholic Church. In that text, Francis wrote of an “urgent need” to take steps leading to the substitution of fossil fuels with alternative energy sources. At the same time, however, the Pope acknowledged that “many professionals, opinion makers, communications media and centers of power, being located in affluent urban areas, are far removed from the poor, with little direct contact with their problems. ” The dire situation of displaced families in Ukraine manifests how the pressing needs of the poor must take priority over ideological concerns, since they don’t have the luxury of expensive forms of alternative energy. Francis himself has warned that when Christian charity is not at the core of the Church’s message, “it is not the Gospel which is being preached, but certain doctrinal or moral points based on specific ideological options. ” “Any Church community, if it thinks it can comfortably go its own way without creative concern and effective cooperation in helping the poor to live with dignity and reaching out to everyone, will also risk breaking down, however much it may talk about social issues or criticize governments,” he wrote. In 2015, Forbes magazine published an article titled “How Opposition to Fossil Fuels Hurts the Poor Most of All. ” In the essay, Alex Epstein argued that efforts by the UN and certain individual governments to massively restrict fossil fuel energy would punish the very people who need them most: the poor. Fossil fuels, he contended, provide the “energy that underdeveloped countries need to grow and indeed to survive,” as the recent history of India and China attest. Thanks to the availability of fossil fuels, he wrote, “life got better for billions of people in just a few decades” while “the infant mortality rate has plummeted. ” While everyone would prefer clean, renewable energy sources, the number one concern of the nations of the world must be meeting the real needs of real human beings —  which at present means access to cheap fossil fuels. Pope Francis would no doubt agree as his recent actions would seem to indicate. Father Serhiy Koval, the local parish administrator in Vilcha, expressed his gratitude to Pope Francis for his timely aid, as reports suggest that the only kind of support these people have received has come from the Church and parishioners.

22125,NYT’s Peters: ’Lot of Frustration’ Among Democratic Sens Who Think It’s ’Shortsighted’ to Filibuster Gorsuch - Breitbart,"On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” New York Times Reporter and MSNBC Contributor Jeremy Peters stated, “there’s a lot of frustration privately among Democratic Senators, who will tell you, it’s incredibly shortsighted of the Democrats” to try to filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court.  Peters said, “On the Gorsuch nomination, Joe, there’s a lot of frustration privately among Democratic Senators, who will tell you, it’s incredibly shortsighted of the Democrats to block this  —   or to try to block this, they can’t block it, of course, and lose their ability to filibuster whoever Trump nominates for the next open court seat. Because you don’t know what the political dynamics are going to look like. You don’t know how weak or strong Trump might be then. And if you take away the filibuster, and waste it on this fight, you basically give Trump carte blanche to nominate whomever he wants to the Supreme Court the next time around, and that one’s going to be possibly for the Kennedy seat, and that one determines the makeup of the court. So, it seems like a wasted bullet I think, at least this is what I’m hearing from some Democrats about it in the Senate. ” (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
22126,These Blast Points on Hillary's Campaign... Only The Deep State Is So Precise,"These Blast Points on Hillary's Campaign... Only The Deep State Is So Precise   Charles Hugh Smith 
The Deep State's most prescient elements must derail Hillary's campaign to clear a path to Trump's executive team. 
Back in August, I asked Could the Deep State Be Sabotaging Hillary? I think we now have a definitive answer: ""These blast points on Hillary's campaign... too accurate for the Mainstream Media. Only the forces of the Imperial Deep State are so precise."" 
The Mainstream Media is presenting the FBI investigation as a ""lose-lose"" situation for embattled FBI Director Comey. If Comey remained quiet until after the election, he would be accused of colluding with the Clinton campaign and its allies in the Department of Justice (sic). 
But in going public, he stands accused by Democrats of ""intervening in an election,"" i.e. raising doubts about Hillary's judgement and veracity days before Americans go to the polls. 
Another narrative has Comey's hand forced by the threat of disgusted FBI agents leaking information that would show the FBI caved into political pressure from the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign to keep relevant material out of the public eye until after the election. 
I submit another much more powerful dynamic is in play: the upper ranks of the Deep State now view Hillary as an unacceptable liability. The word came down to Comey to act whether he wanted to or not, i.e. take one for the good of the nation/Deep State/Imperial Project. 
As a refresher: the Deep State is the unelected government (also called the invisible or shadow government) that is not as monolithic as generally assumed. 
The neo-conservative globalists who want Hillary to continue pushing their agenda are the more visible camp, but another less visible but highly motivated camp realizes Hillary and her neo-con agenda would severely damage the nation's security and its global influence. It is this camp that is arranging for Hillary to lose. 
The consensus view seems to be that the Establishment and the Deep State see Trump as a loose cannon who might upset the neo-con apple cart by refusing to toe the neo-con line. 
This view overlooks the reality that significant segments of the Deep State view the neo-con strategy as an irredeemable failure. To these elements of the Deep State, Hillary is a threat precisely because she embraces the failed neo-con strategy and those who cling to it. From this point of view, Hillary as president would be an unmitigated disaster for the Deep State and the nation/Imperial Project it governs. 
Whatever else emerges from the emails being leaked or officially released, one conclusion is inescapable: Hillary's judgement is hopelessly flawed. Combine her lack of judgement with her 24 years of accumulated baggage and her potential to push the neo-con agenda to the point of global disaster, and you get a potent need for the Deep State's most prescient elements to derail her campaign and clear a path to Trump's executive team.

22128,Oregon Counties Declare Sanctuary Status Against Gun Control,"Four counties in the state of Oregon have declared sanctuary status, saying they will not enforce the universal background checks which Democrats heaved upon the state in 2015. [The law requires all gun sales —  retail or private —  to be conducted via the auspices of a Federal Firearms License holder (FFL).  When the law took effect in August 2015 it immediately placed a strain on those charged with enforcing it and a number of sheriffs in the state quickly made known that it would not be a priority for their departments. The Statesman Journal quoted Polk County Sheriff Bob Wolfe saying, “Right now, I don’t know if I even have enough people to enforce it. We’ll have to evaluate it on a case by case basis until we can get some staff on and figure out if we even have the resources to really deal with it. ” KTVZ reports that since then “four counties have passed a measure known as the Second Amendment Preservation ordinance. ” This ordinance declares that the sheriffs of the four counties are not obligated to enforce the gun control measure. And “commissioners in Malheur, Union and Lake counties” have all heard proposals for the same ordinance during recent weeks. Gun control advocate Penny Okamoto says counties are not allowed to take such action because of Oregon’s preemption law. Because of this, she says the ordinance barring enforcement of gun control is “largely very symbolic. ” But Coos County’s Rob Taylor —  a chief proponent of Second Amendment Preservation ordinances —  begs to differ. He wants Oregon to have “sanctuary counties” where the Second Amendment is free from gun control enforcement in much the same way that the state “has become a sanctuary state for immigration. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

22129,Trump Meets With Some Vocal Critics: Editors at Vanity Fair and Vogue - The New York Times,"  Donald J. Trump arrived at 1 World Trade Center a little before 10 a. m. on Friday to face some of his harshest critics in New York: top editors and digital directors of Condé Nast’s stable of magazines, among them Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and Vogue. According to a tweet by Mr. Trump, he had been invited by Anna Wintour, Condé Nast’s artistic director and the editor of Vogue. Also in attendance were Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, who has sparred with Mr. Trump since his days as an editor at Spy magazine in the 1980s, and David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, who is an expert on Russia. They have been among Mr. Trump’s most vocal detractors, along with the writers at Teen Vogue. The meeting, held in a conference room on the 42nd floor with a view of New Jersey, lasted barely an hour. In answering questions from editors, Mr. Trump addressed health care, climate change, relations with Russia, women’s issues and abortion rights. Mr. Trump mostly reiterated plans or policies he has discussed publicly for months, according to two people who were apprised of the meeting but spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to talk. When asked about health care, for instance, he told the group that he did not want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act until he had another plan in place, one of the people said. Several editors contacted declined to discuss the meeting, which was off the record. “Not my preference,” Mr. Carter wrote in an email. “But I will abide by that. ” A Condé Nast spokesman declined to comment. Ms. Wintour visited Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in   after she had criticized the Trump Foundation and suggested that Mr. Trump and his family would personally profit from his time in the White House. Ms. Wintour, a supporter of Hillary Clinton, later apologized for the comments. Mr. Trump was photographed entering Condé Nast’s headquarters alongside Michael Flynn, his choice to be national security adviser. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, and Kellyanne Conway, his incoming counselor, were also there. Hilary Rosen, a political strategist for SKD Knickerbocker in Washington, said all of Condé Nast’s brands have had a relationship with presidential families over the years. “It is a rich opportunity for content,” she said. Michelle Obama has been on the cover of Vogue, for example. At the same, Ms. Rosen added, “It’s not like their progressive agenda is going to have an impact on Trump. ” Ms. Rosen, who had close ties to the Clinton campaign, characterized Mr. Trump’s meetings with media outlets as “nothing more than an attempt by his team’s part to take the horns off. ” In a phone interview on Friday night, Ms. Conway declined to discuss the substance of the meeting, but said it was an opportunity for Mr. Trump to “connect with the media. ” She added that “no consideration was given to image. ” In December, Mr. Trump criticized Vanity Fair on Twitter after the magazine gave the restaurant in Trump Tower a bad review. Subscription sales have soared in the wake of Mr. Trump’s criticism, the magazine said. And Vanity Fair printed his tweet on its latest cover.",0
22130,Media’s Heads EXPLODE When City’s Biggest Police Union Awards Sheriff David Clarke ‘Man of the Year’,"0 comments Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, an avid Black Lives Matter opponent, was named named Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association’s Person of the Year, infuriating liberals! 
“I think of Sheriff David Clarke the same way I regard Bull Connor. The same kind of law enforcement officer who would sick fire hoses and dogs on elderly women,” said one liberal who I refuse to give any fame. 
“He really is often times nothing less than a hate-monger.”, said another. 
“I always cheer up immensely if an attack is particularly wounding because I think, well, if they attack one personally, it means they have not a single political argument left.”, said former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
Liberals are idiots! They do not like the clear to understand outspokenness of Sheriff David Clarke because without throwing ad-hominem, they cannot defeat his message. 
Sheriff David Clarke hist back at gun control supporters, Black Lives Matter, Barack Obama, and a number of other liberal faves that want to destroy the freedom we all enjoy! 
Clarke’s response to the Milwaukee protests in August have cemented his standing as one of the nation’s most divisive law enforcement members. 
After the protesters took to the streets following the police shooting of a black thug, Clarke, who is black, blamed the unrest on “tribal violence.” 
Clarke was appointed to a vacancy in 2002 by Governor Scott McCallum. He was later elected that same year to his first four-year term. 
He was re-elected in November 2006, 2010, and 2014, and is currently serving his fourth full term. 
Sheriff David Clarke is registered and elected as a Democrat, but is a vocal Trump supporter and very critical of Obama and Hillary. 
“He (Obama) didn’t cause this, but you know what, he fuels this sort of misplaced anger” says Sheriff David Clarke in the aftermath of the police being targeted by deadly sniper attacks in Dallas, TX",0

22136,"Pelosi: When Republicans Voted For Trump, It Was Like ’Any Mammal Will Do’ - Breitbart","Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( ) said when Republicans voted for President Donald Trump they were voting a “certain way,” almost like “any mammal will do. ”  When asked if Trump was a dealmaker, Pelosi said, “I will give you this as an example, the first meeting we had, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans leadership in the White House, this is a big deal. I mean it feels you with some pride to have a seat at the table and a new president, I have been at that meeting with President George W. Bush as a leader and same thing with President Obama, and now here we are with a new president. The first thing he says, ‘You know I won the popular vote.’ Well, I thought since he’s being unconventional so will I. Because I was respectful with President Bush and we worked closely with him  —  ” Joe Scarborough interjected, “I bet you are missing him now? Pelosi replied, “He told me I would. He said, ‘You’re going to miss me.’ That was a long time ago. I wish he were president now. I wish Mitt Romney were president. I wish John McCain were president. As far as the Republicans, the people that voted, it’s almost like any mammal will do. They were just voting a certain way. ” She continued her story, “When he said that, I said, ‘That’s not true, there is no evidence to support what you just said.’ If we were going to work together, we have to stipulate to a certain set of facts. When we work with President Bush or when we work across the aisle, we all have to start at a place where we are dealing with facts, evidence, and data and you can compromise. You cannot make things up. He said, ‘Well 3 or 4 million people voted illegally.’ I said, ‘Well, that’s not true.’ And he said ‘and I am not counting California.’ That was pretty sad because he didn’t understand his place in history. ” Pelosi also said Trump does not sleep enough, adding, “I’m concerned about his fitness for office. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
22137,GWB Daughter Barbara Bush to Keynote Planned Parenthood Fundraiser,"Former President George W. Bush’s daughter, Barbara Pierce Bush, will deliver the keynote address at a Planned Parenthood fundraiser in North Texas. [Bush, the CEO and   of Global Health Corps (GHC) is headlining Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas’s 2017 Fort Worth luncheon, reports the Texas Tribune:  High schoolers! Earn community service hours, learn about sexual health, and inspire change Register now: https:  . ! pic. twitter.   —   Planned Parenthood (@PPGreaterTX) February 4, 2017,  “We believe that every person has the right to live a healthy, dignified life,” GHC says in its mission statement. “We also believe that everyone has a role to play in advancing social justice through the health equity movement. ” Bush, 34, joined with her twin sister, Jenna Bush Hager, and others to found GHC in 2009. The organization says its main concern is that “access to healthcare that exists today between the world’s rich and the world’s poor is unjust and unsustainable. ” Speaker sponsors for the fundraiser for the abortion chain’s Greater Texas affiliate will pay $20, 000, while Platinum and Gold Sponsors will pay $10, 000 and $5, 000, respectively. As Breitbart News reported in June of 2016, the New York Times interviewed Bush and Planned Parenthood’s president, Cecile Richards, as they lunched at the Gotham Bar and Grill. “Can I say how impressive Barbara is?” Richards complimented Bush. “It’s one thing to work at a    organization like Planned Parenthood, trying to shift the boat into the 21st century. But it’s another to say: ‘I see a problem, and I’m going to start an organization to fix it. ’” Bush explained her motivation to form her organization. “Since I was born, in 1981, we’ve had the drugs to save the millions of kids around the world who die every year,” she said. “Yet the number of deaths hasn’t dropped at all. We have the tools to keep people healthy, but the systems are broken. ” Richards commiserated with her: “It’s the same in reproductive health. We have the technology. But it’s not enough unless there’s public policy that supports getting women access to care. ” Richards is the daughter of the late Gov. Ann Richards (D) of Texas, who eventually lost to Bush’s father, Republican President George W. Bush, when he ran for governor of Texas in 1994. One of the main connections Richards and Bush have is Hillary Clinton. Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry endorsed Clinton in her bid for the White House in 2016. Clinton said unborn babies have no constitutional rights and that, if elected president, she would work to have the Hyde Amendment repealed so that taxpayer funds could be used for abortions  —   an outcome that would have been an obvious boost for the abortion business. GHC provides opportunities for young people to “work on the frontlines of the fight for global health equity” and offers paid fellowships for them with various “placement” organizations, among them Planned Parenthood Global. Additionally, GHC has provided “placements” at the Clinton Development Initiative, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and the Clinton Health Matters Initiative  —   all of which are part of the Clinton Foundation. Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich details the vast amounts of money that have flowed to both Bill and Hillary Clinton through their foundation from corporations and nations seeking favorable treatment from them. In August of 2013, Bush said she hoped Clinton would run for president because she is “unbelievably accomplished. ” Bush told Richards during their lunch interview, “It’s crazy and sad to think that health care is a polarizing issue. ” She went on to say that the young people in her organization are able to “work on social change” at “Planned Parenthood and other exceptional organizations. ”",0

22143,"Despite Failure of North Carolina Boycott, NCAA to Renew Game Ban Against Bathroom Bill - Breitbart","Despite the complete financial failure of the boycott against the state, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is once again warning the State of North Carolina that if it doesn’t repeal its   bathroom law, the league will cancel all tournament games. And this time the NCAA says it will boycott the Tar Heel State until the year 2022. [In a statement released this week, the NCAA renewed its warning against North Carolina’s HB2 bathroom law that maintains that people only use bathrooms in   facilities that correspond to their birth gender.  Because of the bill, which was signed into law early in 2016, the NCAA announced a boycott of the state for the   season. With the end of that season and looking forward, the NCAA has now reaffirmed its boycott. The league released an updated statement on March 23: Last year, the NCAA Board of Governors relocated NCAA championships scheduled in North Carolina because of the cumulative impact HB2 had on local communities’ ability to assure a safe, healthy, discrimination free atmosphere for all those watching and participating in our events. Absent any change in the law, our position remains the same regarding hosting current or future events in the state. As the state knows, next week our various sports committees will begin making championships site selections for   based upon bids received from across the country. Once the sites are selected by the committee, those decisions are final and an announcement of all sites will be made on April 18. The renewed threat from the college sports association comes on the heels of news that the various attempts to boycott North Carolina have turned out to be a massive failure that has had little financial impact on the state’s economy. The economic statistics for 2016 are in, and it appears that hotel revenue for the Tar Heel State saw no major dip. Indeed, “the state’s economy didn’t miss a beat,” according to the Washington Times. Also, as 2016 ended with various boycotts by sports leagues and liberal groups in the offing, North Carolina ended up coming in fourth in the nation for attracting and expanding businesses. It was the exact same result seen in 2015, so the boycott clearly had no impact on the business climate. North Carolina’s unemployment rate also saw no increases, proving that businesses were not firing employees in droves because of any boycott. Finally, North Carolina’s Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest, recently noted that if it had any impact at all, the boycott only affected the economy at “  of 1 percent of our annual GDP. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
22145,The Media Try Blaming Donald Trump for Gianforte in Montana - Breitbart,"Republican Greg Gianforte alleged assault on UK Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on Wednesday would appear to be utterly indefensible. [There is little room for doubt about what happened in Montana: there were multiple eyewitnesses, and Gianforte was charged with assault that day. If Gianforte loses Thursday’s special election in Montana, he will deserve to lose it.  At the same time, nothing justifies the mainstream media’s effort to blame President Donald Trump for what happened. And the media’s hypocrisy is evident in their failure to blame President Barack Obama when Democrats used violence in similar cases. The most relevant example is the case of former Rep. Bob Etheridge ( ) who assaulted a student (see photo above) who was filming him on a public street in 2010 and asking him if he “fully support[ed] the Obama agenda. ” The incident was captured on film, and the story was broken by Breitbart News. Etheridge went on to lose his congressional race to Republican Renée Elmers (who was unseated last year). There was also a similar (though less severe) report in Montana itself in 2012, when a local Democrat was accused of slapping the phone out of the hands of a reporter asking questions. Today, Trump’s critics are citing President Trump’s claim that the media are the “enemy of the people,” among other statements, to claim that he has implicitly condoned Gianforte allegedly did. But when Andrew Breitbart pointed out that Obama’s deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina, had told Democrats in 2009 to “punch back twice as hard,” and connected that incendiary rhetoric to the beating of black vendor Kenneth Gladney by leftist thugs outside a Missouri town hall, the media were silent. They never tried blaming President Obama for Etheridge or any of the other incidents. It is not “whataboutism” to compare these cases, because all can  —   or should  —   agree that candidates physically attacking journalists is indefensible. But the media can and must be expected to apply a uniform standard to politicians from both parties. Instead, today, the media are showing their true partisan colors by using the Gianforte incident to impugn Trump  —   when they never did the same to Obama. The most ridiculous example was on CNN Wednesday night, when host Don Lemon badgered guest Paris Dennard, insisting that he blame Trump, snorting when he would not, and then attacking Dennard’s bona fides: “I can’t believe that you believe the words that are coming out of your mouth. ” He cut Dennard off when he tried to reply. The double standard reveals that Trump’s critics are not concerned  —   at least, not primarily  —   about press freedom. Arguably, their effort to blame Trump for what happened in Montana, when they gave Barack “we bring a gun” Obama a perpetual pass, undermines efforts to convince the public to take attacks on journalists more seriously.

22147,CA Dem Make Massive Move to DESTROY Rule of Law… Spread This EVERYWHERE,"You are here: Home / US / CA Dem Make Massive Move to DESTROY Rule of Law… Spread This EVERYWHERE CA Dem Make Massive Move to DESTROY Rule of Law… Spread This EVERYWHERE October 29, 2016 
Mediaite reported : 
California Democratic Attorney General Kamala Harris told a group of Hispanic supporters earlier this week that someone who has engaged in illegal immigration “is not a criminal.” 
Harris is favored by a wide margin in Senate race in the deep blue state, but her Democratic opponent Loretta Sanchez has been polling better with Hispanics. Accordingly, The Sacremento Bee reports that Harris has been making a full-court press for the Latino vote in the final days of the election. 
The Bee reports that Harris’ comment was not a one-off pronouncement, but has become a standard campaign line. Harris is also citing her work defending sanctuary cities and her work “organizing legal services for unaccompanied minors during the Central American refugee crises.” 
The Left has been working feverishly for years to make the public believe that illegally entering this country isn’t a crime, hence the word “undocumented.” 
Liberals love to use the word “undocumented” instead of the correct word, “illegal.” But someone that doesn’t go through the legal system to immigrate to this country isn’t simply “undocumented,” they are a criminal. 
Using the term “undocumented” makes it seem as if it’s just a simple oversight and not criminal activity. That argument wouldn’t fly if you didn’t file your taxes, and it shouldn’t fly here either. 
I doubt it would go over too well if someone who didn’t file their taxes for years claimed that they weren’t tax evaders, but simply “undocumented tax filers.” 
There’s another claim also made by the anti-rule of law folks. Illegal immigrants can’t be held responsible because the system is super hard! 
Well guess what, the tax system is all kinds of messed up, takes far too much money from Americans, and is extremely complicated — so can you use that same excuse applied to illegal immigrants for why you didn’t file your taxes? 
Nope, legal Americans are held to a different standard. We’re expected to pay for people who break our laws to come here and get welfare, food stamps, social security, Medicare/Medicaid, etc. 
We need the rule of law restored in this country, and we need a president that is going to put the interests of American citizens first. That’s precisely what Donald Trump has proposed to do — and is the opposite of what Hillary Clinton has proposed. 
Let’s hope that Americans see that on Nov. 8.",0
22152,Monsanto Wants To Patent The Marijuana Genome! These People Are Trying To Stop Them,"Share on Facebook Medicinal marijuana is fast becoming more accepted as a a legitimate treatment thanks to scientific studies and patient's testaments. A recent change in legislation has created fears that Monsanto are about to try and cash in on this new treatment. Despite the fact that the U.S. Government are unwilling to change national laws, five states are about to vote to change their marijuana laws in November, and it looks likely that they will vote to join the states that have already legalized it. With more states choosing to legalese, there is a real fear that big pharmaceutical companies that are notorious for being profit-driven at the expense of health will wade into this new market. In 2015, it came to light that Monsanto, the agrochemical corporation wanted to get involved in the marijuana business. The news was met with a great deal of contempt from medicinal marijuana enthusiasts, and was followed by a statement from Monsanto that they had no interest in expanding into this field. In April, Spokeswoman, Charla Lord told the Willamette Week “Monsanto has not, is not and has no plans for working on cultivating cannabis.” But activists kept a close watch on Monsanto's movements and sure enough their suspicions were correct when it was revealed that they had made the first ever genetically modified strain of marijuana, and was also looking to patent the product. In an effort to stop Monsanto having the monopoly on this,a pioneering biotechnology startup based in Portland have launched an online interactive guide that maps the genetic evolution of the marijuana genome, thus making it public property and harder for Monsanto to lay a claim to it. The startup is called Phylos Bioscience, and it has been collecting samples of marijuana strains for over two years in order to sequence the plant's DNA. The are developing a software that presented a 3-D visualization of the data, and it is about to be revealed. Named 'Galaxy' the interactive guide allows you to take a tour round a three-dimensional projection of the genetic information they have drawn from the plant. Phylos Bioscience hope that by making this information public, they can keep the information in the hands of the underground societies where it began, and out of the hands of the commercial companies. Sales and Marketing Manager of Phylos Bioscience, Carolyn White has said “Sample collection was a huge part of this process. One side was a collaboration with growers, dispensaries and labs to collect modern samples, and the other a process of hunting down ancient landrace strains from all over the world.” “We've collected samples from all over the world, and cataloged the genetic information encoded in their DNA,” Dr Holmes, Phylos's chief science officer and molecular and evolutionary biologist and Phylos Bioscience co-founder told The New York Times. Because of this data collected by Phylos Bioscience, it could mean better protection of intellectual property rights of marijuana growers and keep it away from the likes of Monsanto. Related:",0
22153,What Trump Accomplished During ‘Positive and Productive’ Meetings with China,"President Donald Trump discussed several issues with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their   meetings at    this week. [Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that Trump was able to build on his important relationship with the president of China but was “frank” and “candid” about their differences.  “I think all of us are feeling very good about the results of this summit in terms of what it did for setting a very constructive tone going forward,” he said. Chinese State media noted that “Xi’s   trip at    was marked by cordiality, with both presidents seen smile [sic] to each other. ” Some issues discussed during the visit are important to the United States: Trade and Currency, Trump told the Chinese that they needed to “level the playing field for American workers,” according to a statement from the White House. He expressed concerns about the Chinese government’s intervention in U. S. economy was hurting jobs for the American worker. Both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross spoke positively of a “  plan” that they discussed with their Chinese counterparts to make important changes immediately. “The most interesting thing to me was they expressed an interest in reducing their net trade balance because of the impact it’s having on money supply and inflation,” Ross said about the Chinese. “That’s the first time I’ve heard them say that in a bilateral context. ” According to Xinhua, the Chinese state media, President Xi urged both countries to “grasp the opportunity” of economic development between the two countries and signaled interest in future investments. “China welcomes the U. S. side to participate in cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative,” said Xi. North Korea, Trump and the Chinese agreed that North Korea’s nuclear weapons program presented a challenge to the region and said that they would take steps to pressure the rogue state with the “international community. ” No agreement was reached, but the United States reasserted that it is willing to act alone. “[W]e understand it creates unique problems for them and challenges and that we would, and are, prepared to chart our own course if this is something China is just unable to coordinate with us,” Tillerson said. South China Sea, Officials from the United States discussed the ongoing military buildup in the East and South China Seas, but the result was merely a “candid” conversation. “President Trump noted the importance of adhering to international rules and norms in the East and South China Seas and to previous statements on ” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement.

Trends US Elections 2016 
A man dressed as a construction worker arrived at the site early Wednesday morning to inflict some serious damage on the Hollywood Boulevard star. Using a sledgehammer, the man later identified as Jamie Otis attacked the star, literally pounding it to dust as onlookers watched. 
Trump’s star has seen a lot of abuse during his presidential run. From being spray-painted with a Swastika to being covered in dog feces and having its own wall built around it, the star has been a target for disgruntled Americans angered by the Republican candidate’s controversial statements.

Otis originally planned to remove the star and then auction it off, with the money going towards victims of Trump’s alleged sexual harassment and assault. Speaking to reporters at the scene, Otis explained “four or five” of his family members had been victims of sexual assault, and he wa s “terribly upset that we have a presidential nominee who is the poster child for sexual violence.” 
Over the past month, nearly a dozen women have come forth to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them in the past. Most are represented by Gloria Allred, a California lawyer and outspoken Democrat. 
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which is in charge of the Walk of Fame, condemned the star’s destruction. 
“The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees,” Chamber of Commerce’s Leon Gubler said. “When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark. Our democracy is based on respect for the law. People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property.” 
The Chamber of Commerce is working to prosecute those involved, Gubler said, adding that the star will be repaired immediately.

[11/2/16] An analysis of data by The Times shows that crop yields did not increase and herbicide and insecticide use did not shrink in the 20 years since GMO seeds were introduced in North America. In fact, herbicide use has increased . 
“An analysis by The Times using United Nations data showed that the United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields — food per acre — when measured against Western Europe, a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like France and Germany,” an October 29 Times article stated. 
Times researchers compared data from Europe, where genetic modification was rejected, with that from Canada and the United States, where they are widely used. The data goes back 20 years and indicates that GM technology did not deliver on some of the promises that its promoters made. 
In fact, herbicide use has increased by 21 percent in the U.S. while it has decreased by 36 percent in France’s, Europe’s largest agriculture producer. GMO seeds have led to a decrease of about 33 percent in insecticide and fungicide use in the U.S., but France has seen an even larger decrease — 65 percent – without using genetically modified crops.

22174,Comey Must Explain Why He Advised Obama Not to Publicly Accuse Russia of Hacking Democrats,"By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 1:26 pm Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as ""partisan"". Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Russia did hack the Democrats. So all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the U.S. election. 
But FBI Director James Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as “partisan”. 
Republican FBI Director James Comey advised the Obama administration not to publicly accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and more “on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the Nov. 8 election,” officials “familiar with the deliberations” told the Washington Post. 
These sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity. 
There are a few reasons why Comey might want to keep his agency’s investigation of Russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be re-opening its exhaustive investigation of Clinton’s emails, which resulted from a Republican-led, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless Benghazi investigation that also cleared Clinton, it seems odd that Comey was going to stay silent on the Russia matter. 
Comey’s decisions is especially odd given the reports that the Russians have been communicating and coordinating with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the point that he is already “compromised.” 
Only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the United States president. 
The same sources tell the Post that Comey made the decision to reveal the Clinton emails to Congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. 
Not sure I’m buying that because if Comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldn’t have said anything at all, but that doesn’t mean that his motives were nefarious. 
There might well be good reason for this – after all, this is the FBI and they can’t tell us everything, but as of right now Comey has mishandled this `and appears to be trying to influence an election to help Republicans. Just because he is a Republican and just because he has donated to Republicans doesn’t mean he isn’t doing his job properly. 
But Comey has a lot of explaining to do right now. He is under fire for good reason, as the explanations he’s giving for these decisions don’t make sense and are contradictory.",0

McEnany mentioned that DeVos has not had the same type of exchange with Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association (NEA).  “I think it’s imperative that we work together to find common ground,” DeVos said. “If students represent 100 percent of our future, we need to be focused on what’s right for them and doing what’s right for them. ” “My conversation with Randi was great, and we’ve agreed to visit schools together,” the secretary added. “I will visit a school she selects  —   a traditional public school  —   and she will visit a choice school.

Hillary is NOT a champion for gays. 
She takes MILLIONS from countries who abuse, imprison, and execute gays. 
Clinton turns a BLIND EYE to these grotesque atrocities to gays (and women) so she can keep lining her pockets. 
She even laughed when Trump asked her to return the BLOOD MONEY to these hateful countries. 
On top of that, Clinton wants to FLOOD America with Muslin refugees from these “moderate Muslim” countries that abuse, imprison, and execute gays and women. 
These people do not want to assimilate to Western culture – they come here and spread their 7th-century HATE. 
This is why so many gays support Trump. 
From Washington Examiner : 
The Miami chapter of LGBTQ Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) announced on Monday its decision to break with the national organization to support GOP nominee Donald Trump for president. 
“We, as Log Cabin Republicans of Miami, we’re Americans first, we’re Republicans second, and we happen to be gay or allies of the LGBT community. American national security is our government’s first and foremost responsibility, then the economy – those two issues really are paramount to any American,” Miami chapter president Vincent Foster told the Washington Examiner on Monday evening. 
“Our membership has gotten behind the Republican national nominee and it’s unfortunate that other Republicans are unable to do so. Regardless of differences, we understand that a Hillary Clinton presidency is only going to be detrimental to the LGBT community and the general American population.” 
LCR announced on Oct. 22 that it would not support Trump despite his being “perhaps the most pro-LGBT presidential nominee in the history of the Republican Party” because he has “concurrently surrounded himself with senior advisers with a record of opposing LGBT equality.” 
Foster said the national organization’s decision was a “big surprise” and prompted the South Florida chapter to re-evaluate the matter. On Oct. 26, the 20 members of Miami LCR unanimously voted to endorse Trump. 
The Miami chapter has had a long-standing relationship with Trump, Foster explained. The billionaire businessman’s campaign initially reached out to the group months ago to work together in the battleground state. Foster added the campaign attended the group’s Lincoln Day dinner and has been fully supportive of them. 
“To have a Republican presidential nominee who cares so much, especially after Orlando – that resonated so much,” Foster said. 
Although LCR typically does not allow local chapters to support other candidates, the organization is allowing for flexibility in this election. The Washington, D.C.-based national group is permitting regional chapters to endorse or not endorse Trump in this election. 
Log Cabin Republicans in Cleveland, Los Angeles, Orange County, Texas and Georgia have also endorsed Trump, according to Angelo.

“Faced with the choice between changing one’s mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everybody gets busy on the proof.” -J. K. Galbraith
Last month, tensions between dark matter simulations and galactic rotation observations reached a new high. Despite all the successes of dark matter on the largest scales — for the CMB, for large-scale structure, for gravitational lensing and for galaxy clusters, among others — the simplest dark matter simulations reproduced unrealistic results for how individual galaxies ought to rotate. Moreover, a team of scientists uncovered a surprising relationship: between the normal (baryonic) matter alone and the observed acceleration in galaxies.
The correlation between gravitational acceleration (y-axis) and the normal, baryonic matter (x-axis) visible in an assembly of 153 galaxies. The blue points show each individual galaxy, while the red show binned data. Image credit: The Radial Acceleration Relation in Rotationally Supported Galaxies, Stacy McGaugh, Federico Lelli and Jim Schombert, 2016. From https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05917v1.pdf.
If dark matter were real, then the simulations needed to reproduce that result as well, which appeared to be a tremendous challenge. Yet in a new paper, two scientists from McMaster University, Ben Keller and James Wadsley, did exactly this. Even more impressively, they didn’t make new simulations, they simply took pre-existing ones and showed that this relation does, in fact, get reproduced among all their galaxies.
While the web of dark matter (purple) might seem to determine cosmic structure formation on its own, the feedback from normal matter (red) can severely impact galactic scales. Image credit: Illustris Collaboration / Illustris Simulation.

22190,DELINGPOLE: The EPA’s Air Pollution Scare Is Fake News Myth,"More fake news from the Washington Post: turns out that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has helped save Americans from a substance which kills 4. 2 million people every year  —   air pollution. [No really. If you believe WaPo it’s the fifth deadliest killer known to man:  The researchers concluded that exposure to particulate pollution was the fifth deadliest health risk of all 79 they studied, ranking behind high blood pressure, smoking and high blood sugar, and about matching high cholesterol  —   conditions many people upend their lives in order to mitigate. Air pollution exposure was deadlier than having high body mass index or alcohol use. So clearly, WaPo’s message runs, President Trump would be mad to rein in this vitally important agency. Except the claims just aren’t true. As Steve Milloy explains in lavish and incontrovertible detail in his book Scare Pollution: Why and How to Fix the EPA this whole scare story is based on the flimsiest of junk science. In a chapter called EPA Fails Every Test  —   because it describes how the EPA fails every test  …      —   Milloy describes failings in the EPA’s methodology so spectacular you’re left gasping in disbelief that this could be the handiwork of a real government agency. Surely, you tell yourself, this must be some kind of Manchurian EPA, a sort of parody organisation designed and funded by some sinister   cabal with the express intention of satirising Big Government lunacy and discrediting the Obama administration which relied on it so heavily to advance its war on capitalism. But no the Environmental Protection Agency really is as useless as its critics say  —   and nowhere is this more evident than in the way it concocted a completely dishonest air pollution scandal involving particles classified as PM2. 5. If you believe WaPo’s editorial, this is the fifth biggest killer of our age. But that’s only because they’ve taken at its word a big new report State of Global Air  —   which was part funded by the Environmental Protection Agency and which used the same suspect methodology the EPA used to finger PM2. 5 as the major environmental problem it simply isn’t. Milloy who has testified before a number of Congressional hearings on the subject describes it as the “biggest government science fraud of our time. ” What the EPA and its useful idiots in the media have done is to take the public’s perfectly natural concerns about pollution and air quality  —   but then demonise air particles so tiny and ubiquitous that it’s quite impossible to regulate against them without damaging whole swathes of US industry. Which is exactly what the EPA has done. Its ozone rule  —   introduced to combatPM2. 5 has lumbered the US economy with an estimated $1 trillion in compliance costs and more or less destroyed the US coal industry, wiping out 90 per cent of its value during the Obama years. So there must be some evidence to justify all those job losses and all that massive economic damage? Nope. None at all. You can read the full details on this fact sheet. Not one single epidemiological study, not one toxicological study, not one clinical study has EVER demonstrated that PM2. 5 is capable of causing death either in the short term or due to prolonged exposure. If these tiny particles (which by the way are produced by dust, pollen, mould, pet dander, forest fires, sea spray and volcanoes, among other natural sources, as well as from cigarette and dope smoking, wood fire burning and fossil fuel burning) were as deadly as the EPA claims, people would be dropping like flies from London to New York to Beijing. But they’re not. The whole problem is an EPA fabrication.

22192,Liberals urge NASA to release satellite map of “Diwali pollution” in India,"Liberals urge NASA to release satellite map of “Diwali pollution” in India Posted on Tweet 
In a written petition via Change.org, as many as 420 Indian liberals from a group named “Liberals for Indian Equality & Secularism” (LIES) have urged the National Aeronautical Space Agency to release a satellite map highlighting pollution all over India, during the Hindu festival of lights, Diwali. According to the petition, the map would go a long way in effectively eradicating the menace of pollution, which according to them, was largely due to the festival. 
A copy of the petition has been provided to us by The UnReal Times’ liberal beat reporter Christopher Ali Kumar, who himself is one of its signatories: 
“Respected Mr. Bolden, 
We are a group of concerned Indian citizens, who have united to seek your assistance in order to once and for all eradicate the catastrophic menace of pollution due to the Hindu festival called Diwali. Diwali, which is the festival of lights, has unfortunately been misappropriated by the communal, right-wing, divisive, Hindutva forces who viciously pollute the atmosphere, scare away and even injure poor, defenseless animals and birds with their egregious bursting of crackers and fireworks. Often, these majoritarian celebrations have gone overboard and out of control, disturbing the peaceful minorities, unsettling secularism and communal harmony, which are the foundations for the very idea of India. Accidental injuries to their own selves too have proved to be of no avail when it comes to curbing these detrimental ceremonies. Pardon the pun, Mr. Bolden, but the fact that they have a favorable Prime Minister in Narendra Modi only seems to have emboldened them all the more. 
All this is notwithstanding the fact that India’s national capital is already among the world’s most polluted cities. We recently determined that despite multiple statements of denials from your agency, a satellite map of India purported to be released by your esteemed organization, still continues to go viral every year, during this season and otherwise. Given the unmitigated response that the image has been getting for over a decade now, we beseech your organization to consider releasing a satellite map depicting India’s alarming, fatal pollution levels during the Diwali season. We are of the strong, firm belief that such an image would dramatically and remarkably pay off in wiping away the gross misfortune of Diwali pollution. 
If releasing such a map would be too much trouble, we are absolutely okay even with a hoax image which you could ‘leak.’ We could take it forward from there and ensure a significant impact. 
While it is real journalism to convey facts, it is courageous, important journalism to drive home a narrative for the betterment of people and like on countless other occasions, we firmly believe that, this time too, thanks to the prevalent, highly polluted atmosphere in India, the latter requires our unstinting support. 
Looking forward to your cooperation and support, 
Warm regards, LIES”

22193,Why We Wait For The Future,"opednews.com - Advertisement - 
I have suggested elsewhere that if we want a better future we will have to create it out of whole cloth and intend that it be 'for the highest and best good for all concerned and the planet'. 
Most of us know that two things cannot occupy the same space at the same time. The time, space thing that is our planetary reality is occupied by dark, evil, powerful forces with no intention of moving aside to accommodate positive outcomes. 
Carl Jung has noted that ""the opposite of love is not hate, it is power"". I get this. Love nourishes and empowers the object of its attention, power seeks dominion over what it notices, is destructive. We cannot confront this power and it would be karmically harmful to do so resulting in no change. 
So, the existent power, in play for 300,000 years, must 'start' to break down before change is possible, to allow space for that change. If we want to be in control of that change we must be the dominate unified conscious intent during the breakdown of order and focus that positive intend toward a better future. 
The breakdown of order is in play right now in front of our eyes .It is remarkable and noteworthy that the U.S., the evil empire has leveled most of the Middle East, used depleted uranium weaponry in Iraq causing severe genetic damage to newborns for generations, has driven millions of hapless refugees into Europe and I hear no loud, clear voice screaming for them,us, to stop. I have just described an 'end of times, type horror story the evil doers who run the U.S. are engaged in and plan to expand around the globe. They actually plan and promote the breakdown of order, the chaos out of which they expect to rise with an absolute grip on all power. They expect us to welcome this enslavement just to stop the pain and suffering they have caused us. Again, this madness is taking place right now in front of our eyes. 
If the decent and responsible among us organize now to be that dominate unified intent, the dominate consciousness , we would control the aftermath of the planned breakdown of order. Our rulers do not imagine us capable of this since we have behaved like victims who always attract and suffer victimizers to their lives. - Advertisement - 
So that's it. We need about ten percent of us to to lightly hold the intent to create the new paradigm of existence and hold this vision while chaos descends around us. If this is an effort by 'enough' of us we will prevail. The Law of Attraction, the first universal law will assist us and attract more positive energy than thought possible. The planet herself is considered a conscious being and would certainly direct all possible positive energy to our cause-her cause. As our energy grows the energy available to evil wanes. When they sense this their testicles will shrink!

22194,Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan Pledge $3 Billion to Fighting Disease - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, last year said they would give 99 percent of their Facebook shares to charitable causes. Now they are putting a large chunk of that money to work. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the limited liability company into which Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Chan put their Facebook shares, on Wednesday said it would invest at least $3 billion over the next decade toward preventing, curing or managing all diseases by the end of the century. While the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has already made investments in charter schools and education   the money toward curing diseases represents the group’s first major initiative in science. The announcement was also a coming out of sorts for Dr. Chan, who has a big interest in health and was trained in pediatrics. In a speech to introduce the health initiative at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday, Dr. Chan said the work to cure disease was in keeping with her organization’s mission to advance human potential and promote equality. She gave an emotional preamble, describing how a   education helped her succeed as the daughter of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants. “We want to dramatically improve every life in Max’s generation and make sure we don’t miss a single soul,” Dr. Chan said, referring to her and Mr. Zuckerberg’s infant daughter, Maxima. “We’ll be investing in basic science research with the goal of curing disease. ” The event was attended by Mayor Ed Lee of San Francisco Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California and former secretary of homeland security and investors including Yuri Milner, who backed Facebook before it went public. About 63, 000 people watched the event on Facebook Live and there were about 450 attending. Several of Mr. Zuckerberg’s Facebook   or early executives have also pledged money to charity or specifically toward health initiatives. Dustin Moskovitz, a Facebook   is part of the Giving Pledge, through which the world’s wealthiest individuals and families have dedicated a majority of their wealth to philanthropy. Sean Parker, who was president of Facebook when the company was still a   earlier this year said he would give $250 million to six cancer centers nationwide. Other tech billionaires have also given to public health, including Bill Gates, Microsoft’s  . His Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation gave $10. 2 billion through 2014 to global health initiatives like fighting AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Chan, who are also part of the Giving Pledge and have looked up to Mr. Gates, announced the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative at the end of last year. At the time, their Facebook holdings were valued at around $45 billion. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s structure as a limited liability company gives it freedom to also spend on   companies and political donations. Some traditional philanthropies, which have spending restrictions and targets they must meet, disapprove of the L. L. C. structure. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s science work will be led by Cori Bargmann, a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York. The first project will be the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, an independent research center in San Francisco that will bring together engineers, computer scientists, biologists, chemists and others. Formed in partnership with Stanford, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, San Francisco, it will receive initial funding of $600 million over 10 years. At the event Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said that if his organization’s plan to cure or manage all disease worked, it should increase human life expectancy to 100 years. “That doesn’t mean no one will ever get sick,” he said. “But they should be able to treat it and manage it. ”",0

22211,Places Most Unsettled by Rapid Demographic Change Are Drawn to Donald Trump,"Places Most Unsettled by Rapid Demographic Change Are Drawn to Donald Trump Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg, Wall Street Journal, November 1, 2016 
Small towns in the Midwest have diversified more quickly than almost any part of the U.S. since the start of an immigration wave at the beginning of this century. The resulting cultural changes appear to be moving the political needle. 
A Wall Street Journal analysis of census data shows that counties in a distinct cluster of Midwestern states–Iowa, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota–saw among the fastest influxes of nonwhite residents of anywhere in the U.S. between 2000 and 2015. Hundreds of cities long dominated by white residents got a burst of Latino newcomers who migrated from Central America or uprooted from California and Texas. 
That shift helps explain the emergence of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump as a political force, and signals that tensions over immigration will likely outlive his candidacy. Among GOP voters in this year’s presidential primaries, counties that diversified rapidly were more likely to vote for the New York businessman, the Journal’s analysis shows. 
{snip} 
The Journal identified the epicenter of this shift using the diversity index, a tool often used by social scientists and economists. It measures the chance that any two people in a county will have a different race or ethnicity. In 244 counties, that diversity index at least doubled between 2000 and 2015, and more than half those counties were in the cluster of five Midwestern states. The analysis excludes tiny counties that produce numeric aberrations. 
{snip} 
Mr. Trump won about 71% of sizable counties nationwide during the Republican presidential primaries. He took 73% of those where diversity at least doubled since 2000, and 80% of those where the diversity index rose at least 150%, the Journal’s analysis found.

22213,Julian Assange claims Hillary Clinton funded by ISIS BACKERS in ‘MOST DAMNING’ leak,"By wmw_admin on November 4, 2016 Zoie O’Brien — express.co.uk Nov 4, 2016 
The democratic presidential candidate who will go toe-to-toe with billionaire Donald Trump for the White House next week has been at the centre of email controversy for many months. 
Just weeks ahead of the US elections on November 9, the FBI revealed it would re-investigate the content of the correspondence. 
Now Mr Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to the US, said the most damning email yet is about to come out. 
In an interview with veteran journalist John Pilger, for Russia Today, Assange said the Saudi Government funds both ISIS and Clinton’s foundation. 
He said: “There’s an early 2014 email, from very early on, so not so long after she left secretary of state to her campaign manager John Podesta. 
“It states that ISIS is funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar – the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. 
“I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection.” 
Mr Pilger, author of Distant Voices and Tell Me No Lies and owner of Dartmouth Films, asked whether this meant the same people who funded ISIS were funding Hillary Clinton. 
Assange simply replied “yes”. 
He told Dartmouth Films: “All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ‘rogue’ princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. 
“But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.” 
Julian Assange accuses Hillary Clinton of misleading Americans about the true scope of Islamic State’s support from Washington’s Middle East allies 
In one year WikiLeaks has released three sets of emails from the Clinton camp – drawing criticism of Assange. 
When asks by Mr Pilger if he was “trying to get Trump in the White House” Assange denied it. 
However, he said Clinton would win the vote. 
He said: “Trump would not be permitted to win. Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment 
“Banks, intelligence, arms companies.. foreign money etc.. is all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well. 
“Media owners and even journalists themselves.” 
Russia Today released a teaser from the interview which sees Mr Pilger asking if while Mrs Clinton was secretary of state, the State Department was approving massive arms sales, while the Clinton Foundation was also receiving money from them 
Assange replied: “Under Hillary Clinton – and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it – the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. 
“During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value.”",0
22216,Exclusive--Sen. Ron Johnson: ’What We Do Know About Susan Rice Is You Can’t Believe What She Says’,"The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee told Breitbart News that he is very concerned about allegations that Susan Rice, President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, abused her access to intelligence reports that included incidental collection of information about associates of President Donald Trump. [“First of all, I don’t know all there is to know about what Susan Rice was doing,” said Sen. Ron Johnson ( ).  Rice is accused of “unmasking” the names of American citizens associated with Trump in intelligence reports. Those names are deliberately cloaked to preserve the constitutional protections against warrantless monitoring enshrined in the 4th Amendment. “What we do know about Susan Rice is you can’t believe what she says, and that is pretty obvious, so we need to get her under oath,” he said. “It doesn’t surprise me in the slightest that the former administration would utilize the awesome power of the government —  they did it with Lois Lerner and the IRS, using the IRS as a political weapon against their political opponents,” he said. If the Obama administration was willing to use the IRS for political advantage, it is natural for them to use the federal surveillance programs, as well, he said. “We need to get her under oath in front of the Intelligence Committee and let’s see exactly what we do find out about her,” he said. Johnson said he is not worried that political abuse of surveillance and intelligence gathering programs would jeopardize the actual programs themselves. “In a responsible person’s hand, it should not be a problem. We do need the ability to gather intelligence. We need the ability to do these things. ” The senator said another problem is how intelligence related to Trump made its way into the press. “We need to keep these pieces of information classified, as well,” he said. “There’s a reason you have classified information and national security interests —  it is how you keep the nation safe. ” The senator said there is a difference between national security career professionals and the political appointees, such as Rice. “The vast majority of people, career folks in the NSA or the FISA courts, these are patriots trying to keep the nation safe,” he said. “When you have political hacks that potentially use these agencies improperly? That’s the problem. You have to get the political hacks out of the process. ”",0
22223,Return Of The Anunnaki? Nine-feet Tall Giants 'Found Living Near Egyptian Pyramids',"San Francisco | A chinese man visiting his family in California became their neighbor’s worst nightmare when they found out days later that their missing dog had been eaten by the strange visitor. 


The 34-year old plumber from Beijing that has since been arrested does not seem to have any grief over what he did to the couple’s favorite companion, a 7-year old german shepherd, which they’ve had since it was a puppy.

The man’s family has argued in his defense that in his country, it was common for him to eat dog meat and have acknowledged that it was not right to eat their neighbor’s dog without their consent. They have also offered to replace the dog with another one to help ease the pain of their loss.

“If I had known he was to suffer such a gruesome ordeal, we would’ve never picked him up at the animal shelter” explains the owner, still visibly under shock. The neighbor’s discovered in horror that their dog had been slain by the neighbors when they witnessed the man of Chinese origin grilling what seemed to be pieces of dog meat onto the barbecue. “There were also pieces of fur we found lying on top of the garbage container, as if he wanted us to find them, or was oblivious to the fact that we cared about our dog other than being just a piece of meat” admitted the horrified neighbors.

Humphrey was given a proper burial even though the man had cooked large parts of the dog before police officers arrived on the scene and apprehended the perpetrator. “We buried the parts we could find, what a horrible mess” added the dog’s owner, fighting to contain her tears. “I just hope this awful man goes to prison for a long, long time” she added.

22225,Глава ВАК призвал умерить пыл вокруг диссертации Мединского,"5 комментариев 5 поделились 
Напомним, газета ""Коммерсантъ"" сообщала, что известные российские академики, члены ""Клуба 1 июля"", присоединились к требованию участника сообщества ""Диссернет"" Ивана Бабицкого лишить ученой степени Владимира Мединского . Ученые возмущены тем, что в качестве главного методического принципа своей диссертации министр объявил ""соответствие интересам России"". По словам академиков, Мединский пытался ""заменить истину мифами"", что ""подрывает основы научного взгляда на мир"". 
Ранее ВАК приняла решение отозвать дело о лишении степени из диссертационного совета Уральского федерального университета. ""Вопросы лишения ученых степеней и рассмотрение этого вопроса жестко регламентированы соответствующими нормативными актами. Поэтому здесь надо действовать очень четко, в соответствии именно с этими положениями. Потому что любое нарушение этих действующих положений повлечет автоматическую отмену через суд этого решения, если обратится любая из сторон: или тот, на которого заявляют, или заявители, которые заявляют"", — сказал Владимир Филиппов РИА Новости. 
Глава ВАК подчеркнул, что и Минобрнауки РФ, и руководство аттестационной комиссии действовало в полном соответствии с нормативной базой. 
""Если есть заявление человека, чье аттестационное дело рассматривается в совете, о том, чтобы перенести заседание диссовета, и он, возможно, планирует свое участие, то мы обязаны это сделать. И если будет проведено заседание диссовета при наличии его заявления, то это будет нарушением, и любое решение диссовета в таком случае будет отменено. Диссоветы должны рассматривать поступившие к ним на рассмотрение дела в течение двух месяцев, по истечении двух месяцев уже Минобрнауки должно принимать соответствующее решение, в частности по отзыву диссертации из диссовета"", — сказал Филиппов. 
По его словам, если будет проведено рассмотрение диссертации за пределами двухмесячного срока, любая из сторон может оспорить решение диссовета. В соответствии с нормативной базой, любое решение диссовета может быть отменено. 
Владимир Филиппов отметил, что решение о назначении нового диссертационного совета по этому делу, скорее всего, будет принято 25 ноября на президиуме ВАК. 
Напомним, в апреле участник сообщества ""Диссернет"" Иван Бабицкий подал в Минобрнауки заявление с просьбой лишить Мединского степени, поскольку, по его словам, диссертация ""Проблемы объективности в освещении российской истории второй половины XV — XVII веков"", абсурдна и не имеет научной ценности. 
Владимир Мединский защитил диссертацию в 2011 году в Российском государственном социальном университете, однако позже диссертационный совет РГСУ был распущен, и вопрос о сохранности ученой степени был перенесен в стены Уральского федерального университета. Заседание диссертационного совета УрФУ отменили, так как Мединский на нем не присутствовал. После было объявлено об отзыве дела из диссертационного совета из-за истечения двухмесячного срока рассмотрения. 
Ранее пресс-секретарь Мединского Ирина Казначеева отметила, что под обращением в основном подписались ""физики и математики, которые никогда не скрывали негативного отношения ко всему, что делает власть"". По ее словам, авторы письма пытаются доказать, что лишить ученой степени можно любого человека, который не разделяет каких-либо либо научных или политических взглядов.

22228,U.S. Senator Unloads – “May Be the World’s Largest Money Laundering and Influence-Peddling Operation” (VIDEO),"by LN Buzz Team 
News is now breaking about how it appears the FBI’s primary focus on Clinton surrounds the Clinton Foundation. Specifically, the pay-to-play scheme that was being run through the Foundation while Hillary was head of the State Department. 
Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas joined Fox & Friends this morning and he didn’t hold back. He absolutely unloaded both barrels. 
Here’s the quote followed by video: 
The more we learn about the Clinton Foundation’s operations, whether it’s from the book Clinton Cash, or Bret Baier’s reporting or The Wall Street Journal‘s reporting, the more it becomes clearer that the Clinton Foundation may be the world’s largest money laundering and influence-peddling operation. In fact, with two investigations swirling around Hillary Clinton both the email investigation and the Clinton Foundation investigation, I think it may become clear that those are really the same controversy. One reason why Hillary Clinton probably went and set up a private email server was so she could advance her pay-for-play agenda at the State Department with Clinton Foundation donors giving perks and benefits to dictators and shady oligarchs all around the world. . @SenTomCotton : The Clinton Foundation may be the world's largest money laundering and influence-peddling operation pic.twitter.com/wP8COKjFQN

22229,Homeschool Families Targeted In District’s ‘Operation Round Up’,"Off the Grid News – by Daniel Jennings 
A public school official in Florida has urged citizens to fight truancy by reporting any children they suspect might not be in school or being educated — including homeschool families. 
It is all part of an “anti-truancy” initiative called Operation Round Up, in which residents of Jackson County, Florida, are urged to be on the lookout for children not in school and to report them to school officials or to police. 
A truancy report can lead to a home check by sheriff’s deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents, TV station WJHG reported. 
The policy of the Jackson County School District is to send law enforcement to the homes of suspected truants. 
“Sometimes if these citizens don’t call me, I have no way of knowing,” Shirl Williams, director of student services for the school system, told the TV station. “So if it’s a nosy neighbor, be a nosy neighbor. Just call me and let me check out the situation.” 
Williams acknowledged that homeschool children can be mistaken for truants but urged citizens to report them so school authorities can investigate. 
“Sometimes the community will see them around town and they think, ‘Hey, they’re not being educated.’ Sometimes the community is right,” Williams said. 
Home School Legal Defense Association attorney TJ Schmidt wrote Williams and the Jackson County superintendent, saying that while truancy is a problem, homeschoolers should not be targeted. 
“Your statements suggest that everyone should report children they think aren’t being educated,” the letter read. “In our opinion, this is a threatening practice, and will instill a spirit of suspicion and hostility against homeschoolers in the community.” 
Schmidt wrote to Williams after a parent saw her on TV and complained to HSDLA.

22231,Set Staff Horrified At What Hillary Is Caught Doing After Brutal Interview,"Set Staff Horrified At What Hillary Is Caught Doing After Brutal Interview Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Set of the Commander-in-Chief Forum (left), Hillary Clinton at the Forum (right) 
It was only a matter of time before the glue that keeps Hillary Clinton together cracked and her true evil self came out from behind her forced smile. Looking visibly uncomfortable in front of the camera during a particularly brutal interview, Hillary exited stage left as quick as she could when a horrified staff member caught what she did backstage. 
Hillary probably felt safe going into the interview by liberal-leaning Matt Lauer, who conducted a televised question and answer session with the Democratic candidate in September at the Commander-in-Chief Forum. As she’s apparently accustomed to, Hillary allegedly received a list of questions before the event, so she could prepare her answers (lies) and prevent being caught on the spot to come up with what to say, making her come across flawlessly to the public. Thinking everything was worked to her advantage as is typically the case, Lauer threw the candidate a curve ball that Hillary couldn’t hide from. 
According to The Watch Towers, a Comcast official (the parent company of NBC Universal) stated that Lauer went rogue when he asked “one legitimate question about the FBI investigation concerning her homemade server and the unsecured emails.” The alleged informant said at that point “we could see she (Hillary) was beginning to boil.” 
It’s evident by her expression and tone caught in the recording of the Forum interview that Hillary wasn’t happy about being forced to answer a question she wasn’t prepared for. Holding her rage inside the best she could, the person claiming to be a producer on the set, accused Hillary of launching an explosive verbal assault on her staff backstage after the interview. 
“She was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her – she went kind of manic and didn’t have any control over herself at that point,” the anonymous informant claimed in an unconfirmed report by Watch Towers . 
“Hillary proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and throw it at the face of her assistant, and the screaming started,” the description of the alleged events also said. The staffer claimed that they heard Hillary turn her rage on Donald Trump, saying, “If that f – – – ing bastard wins, we all hang from nooses! Lauer’s finished…and if I lose it’s all on your heads for screwing this up.” 
While the reports of this incident have not been authenticated, it definitely doesn’t seem out of character for Hillary, and with what happened to Lauer after the interview certainly shows that the Democratic candidate complained. “Matt Lauer was massively criticized for the rest of the week on air by the Clinton campaign and the rest of the MSM as having conducted ‘an unfair and partisan attack on Clinton’,” Watch Towers reported. 
As we saw in the court hearings over Benghazi, Hillary is a loose cannon when being called out on her illegal, dishonest, and deadly actions that she’s not used to being confronted on. Whether this explosive tirade happened or not — to any degree of severity — her angry actions against the American people and our heroes she disrespects, speak volumes about who she is, which isn’t someone we need leading our country.",0
22233,California Black Lives Matter Proud of Facebook Post Saying They Spit in Police Officer’s Starbucks - Breitbart,"A California Black Lives Matter group claiming one of its members happily spit in a local police officer’s Starbucks order is also saying they are proud of the incident, even as the Starbuck’s location is denying it ever happened. [A Facebook post on the Black Lives Matter sponsored page titled “Stockton Police Department, Corruption Reporting Page,” announced that a Stockton police officer was given a coffee order laced with spit.  “We are very happy to report that today this officer from Stockton Police Department got to have coffee at Starbucks with the public,” The post reads, “it was hot coffee according to our supporters served with a side of spit they even gave it to him with a smile and a nice comment. ” The post is accompanied by a photo of an officer and his wife and child and was posted on December 28 on a page that also features a banner that reads, “The thin blue line is a terrorist symbol. ” Many commenters at the page criticized the Black Lives Matter group for its cowardly and disgusting action, but the admin of the page replied to many stating they are proud of what they claimed happened. For instance, to one commenter who said, “That’s wrong” the admin replied, “But it feels so good. ” After the Facebook post made a stir, though, the local Starbucks said it investigated the incident and later reported saying they can find no evidence and no employee who perpetrated the spitting. “We are proud of our relationship with the Stockton Police Department, who initially notified us of this rumor. We can confirm there is absolutely no truth to this post, and we are disappointed with the suggestion,” the local Starbucks said in a statement released to Fox 40 Sacramento. After the store’s denial, the Black Lives Matter group insisted that store managers are lying and that the incident did, indeed, take place, but they won’t say which employee did it so the employee won’t face any repercussions. The group also claimed that another restaurant in the area does the same thing to orders by police officers, but the group refused to name the place. Commenters on the story were mostly negative toward the BLM group.

22236,Trump’s Last Campaign Day Spent Fitting In As Much Racism As Possible,"0 Add Comment 
AS America’s ‘decision day’ looms, Republican candidate Donald Trump has been engaged in a frantic bid to fit in as much casual racism as possible on the final day of campaigning. 
“It’s highly likely Donald would be arrested for all the racist, xenophobic and misogynistic things he says if he weren’t a candidate so I think he wants to make the most of his last full day as a fully protected monster,” adviser to Trump, David Scalden explained. 
“Plus, for Donald, it just feels really, really, really, good to give out about people who aren’t white and voting for him,” added Scalden, “it’s not about swing states, or convincing people to vote. Right now, he just wants a podium and a crowd to shout in the general direction of”. 
Trump took to several hastily assembled rallies as he bid to be as freely racist as possible, calling into question any and every non-white race or group of people he could think of. 
“Get me an atlas, let’s see who’s next,” Trump said shortly after doing a 12 minute impression of a person from China while pinning back the skin around his eyes. 
“Believe me, I will be president, but let me tell you if I’m not, I’m gonna get arrested so quickly if I carry this act on after election day, so ya gotta make the most of it folks, believe me,” the tiny handed reality TV star explained. 
It is alleged that aides close to Trump have taken away his phone in recent days for fear he may use Twitter. It is also alleged that they have taken away his make up and fake tan amid fears Trump would attempt ‘black face’ in order to appeal to white supremacists in an actual attempt to reach out to African Americans voters.",0

Jerome Cambrils, obeso mórbido fallecido ayer en Seattle a los 43 años, se ha quedado atrancado en el túnel de la luz al final del túnel, tapando la salida y sumiendo el trayecto en la total oscuridad. “Hay cientos de almas haciendo cola, es un caos”, confirmaba esta mañana la curia vaticana. 
Desde esta madrugada, se han interrumpido los fallecimientos y ya son más de dos millones los enfermos que agonizan a la espera de que el tapón se diluya. “El túnel se diseñó cuando el sobrepeso entre la población no alcanzaba los niveles de hoy en día”, argumenta el padre Almunia, teólogo del Vaticano. 
“Te pasas la vejez haciendo cola en la Seguridad Social y esperas que, al morir, el sufrimiento termine. Y ahora resulta que al otro lado te espera otra cola igual o peor”, lamenta uno de los afectados, que ha pedido que le induzcan un coma “hasta que el puto gordo avance”. 
Aunque la Santa Sede cree que el fallecido acabará cediendo a la presión de los muertos que empujan detrás de él, no sabe concretar cuánto tiempo estará bloqueada la travesía que conecta el mundo de los vivos con el de los muertos.

So I honestly don’t know. I do know that we are in the midst of a civilization warping crisis of public trust, and we need to talk honestly about our institutions that need to be restored and need to have the ability for people in five and eight and ten years to trust these institutions. There are lots of reasonable arguments people can make about the way Director Comey made decisions in the midst of the unprecedented complexities of the 2016 election cycle. ” “Lots of people can think that Director Comey, who is a fundamentally honorable man, but people can think that he executed his job in all sorts of clunky and imperfect ways,” he continued. “That’s a different question than whether or not he should have been fired the way he was last week, and I’ve been critical of that decision. I think it exacerbates the erosion of trust in our institutions. So I’m disappointed in the timing of the firing, but I want to preserve room that there are lots of reasonable reasons that people across the political spectrum can argue about the way the FBI leadership conducted its business in the 2016 cycle. ” (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
22242,Don’t Diss the Dark Ages,"Leave a reply Charles Hugh Smith – Once dissed as The Dark Ages, the Medieval Era is more properly viewed as a successful adaptation to the challenges of the post-Western Roman Empire era. The decline of the Western Roman Empire was the result of a constellation of challenges, including (but not limited to) massive new incursions of powerful Germanic tribes, a widening chasm between the Western and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium), plague, an onerous tax burden on the non-elite classes, weak leadership, the dominance of a self-serving elite (sound familiar?) and last but not least, the expansion of an unproductive rabble in Rome that had to be bribed with increasingly costly Bread and Circuses. In effect, The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire ran out of time and money.The Grand Strategy, successful for hundreds of years, relied heavily on persuading “barbarian” tribes to join the Roman system for the commercial and security benefits. This process of integration worked because it was backed by the threat of destruction by military force. The Empire maintained relatively modest military forces given its vast territory, but its road system and fleet enabled relatively rapid concentration of force to counter an invasion. It also maintained extensive fortifications along active borders. All of this required substantial tax revenues, manpower and effective leadership, not just for fortifications, the army, roads and the fleet, but to maintain the commercial and political benefits offered to “barbarians” who chose integration in the Empire. Once the military threats proliferated and the benefits of Imperial membership eroded, the Grand Strategy was unable to maintain the integrity of the Imperial borders. As tax revenues and the bureaucracy they supported imploded, security declined, reducing trade and communications. This unvirtuous cycle fed on itself: reduced trade led to reduced tax revenues which led to phantom legions that were still listed on the bureaucratic ledgers but which no longer had any troops. The collapse of the Western Empire was a process, not an event. Key organizational infrastructures that endured through the Medieval era–for example, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian Churches–gained traction in the waning centuries of the Western Empire. Monasteries offered islands of scholarship and literacy and in many cases offered security via fortifications. As trade diminished along with secure trade routes, self-reliance became the order of the day outside the borders of the Byzantine and Persian empires. Though political leadership shifted with the latest invasion from the steppes of Eurasia, the two branches of Christendom slowly converted many invading groups or consolidated existing Christian powers into alliances that bound together diverse groups and proto-states. These alliances were typically contingent and temporary, as today’s ally became tomorrow’s enemy, or vice versa. Despite the shifting loyalties of constant invasion and warfare, the Byzantine Empire endured and Charlemagne (and others) in Western Europe established the fractured but still effective Holy Roman Empire. Much was lost when the Western Roman Empire collapsed, but islands of literacy, learning and security arose despite the constant conflicts and threats of invasion. Venice offers one example of a small city securing trade routes with commercial centers that then funded a regional empire. The tidiness of the old Empire could not be reinstated. The adaptations were as messy and untidy as the challenges that swept in from the steppes and forests. So please don’t diss the Dark Ages. Yes, the Roman baths, coliseums and political /social order fell into disrepair, but new ways of coping emerged that were as contingent and untidy as the era’s multiple challenges. New modes of production and new social /political orders do not arise fully formed. They are pieced together by trial and error and numerous cycles of adaptation, innovation and failure.

The UN Human Rights Commission described a number of the atrocities being perpetrated by ISIS operatives during the course of the Mosul offensive in the past week. For example, three women and three young girls were shot to death because one disabled girl could not maintain the pace of a group of villagers who had been evacuated from the place they were in by the terrorists. 
UN officials claim this is just one of a number of cases of civilian executions by ISIS in the past week. Civilians were also used as human shields against the attacks of the Iraqi army and the Kurds. 70 other dead civilians were discovered with gunshot wounds, as well as 50 policemen. 
In the village of Sapina, 45 kilometers south of Mosul, 15 civilians were shot dead and their bodies thrown into a river. Other

22250,TRUMP CALLS FOR TEACHING ‘PATRIOTISM’ IN SCHOOLS,"Email 

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP SIGNALED THURSDAY PLANS TO SEEK NATIONWIDE CHANGES TO SCHOOL CURRICULA WITH THE GOAL OF “PROMOTING AMERICAN PRIDE AND PATRIOTISM IN AMERICA’S SCHOOLS.” 
“In a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America’s children,” Trump said, speaking at the American Legion’s annual convention in Cincinnati. 
“We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America’s history, its institutions and its heroes, many of whom are with us today,” he told the veterans group. 
The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law“We will stop apologizing for America. And we will start celebrating America. We will be united by our common culture, values and principles, becoming one American nation, one country, under one Constitution, saluting one American flag, and always saluting it,” Trump said. 
Last year a Denver-area school board sought to change the content of the AP U.S. history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism. 
That sparked a political proxy war in Jefferson County, Colorado, and the 2015 school board election drew nearly $1 million in campaign funding from outside interest groups. 
Public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding. 
Current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising “any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system.”",0

His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud, dirty trick and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS – just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about. 
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses – acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America. 
Could Hillary’s reported election victory – or Donald Trump’s defeat – signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or “rigged”? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election. 
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest. 
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment’s “selection” for president: 
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny. 
According to an unnamed source – who has provided accurate intel in the past – an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after. 
Date: October 30th – 30 days after the election Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York 
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) – drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre. 
2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) – Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed. 
3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) – Possible new acronym or term for “Martial Law”. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario. 
Source said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military 
At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end.

She was determined to latch on to her high approval ratings and lay the foundation for a second presidential run. That’s when Anthony D. Weiner happened. The husband of Clinton’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, was running for mayor of New York when it was revealed that he had continued to exchange lewd messages with women online even after the practice cost him his congressional seat. The incident brought Abedin’s relationship with Clinton into the spotlight, and Clinton was once again making headlines for sexual indiscretions. Now, just weeks away from the election, Weiner has pulled her into yet another one of his dramas. Federal investigators are looking into his sexual messaging with an underage girls, and they just happened to stumble across thousands of emails that are potentially pertinent to the FBI investigation of Clinton’s private email server. This was disturbing for many reasons. Americans are not happy that the Clintons have a continued behavior of standing behind those who have committed dangerous sexual or financial acts. That doesn’t align well with Hillary’s message about empowering women. In fact, many of Clinton’s friends have suggested she distance herself from Abedin. Still, she kept Abedin close by her side as she prepared to make a statement about the new revelation to the media. “We of course stand by her,” her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, said on Saturday when he was asked whether Abedin would step down. The question on many Americans’ minds now is whether Clinton’s loyalty to Abedin would inspire her to bring her friend (and her drama) into the White House if she wins the presidency.

22261,Federal Complaint Traces Ahmad Khan Rahami’s Steps Before Bombings - The New York Times,"Federal authorities in Manhattan and New Jersey charged Ahmad Khan Rahami with several crimes late Tuesday, including the use of weapons of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use. A federal complaint roughly laid out the method the authorities believe Mr. Rahami used to compile the materials for bombs and then place them in New Jersey and New York. Here are some details from the document: Two days before the bombing in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, Mr. Rahami was filmed igniting a device in the backyard of his home in Elizabeth, N. J. Federal investigators said the video shows Mr. Rahami in his backyard, lighting the fuse of a small cylindrical object in the ground followed by a loud noise and flames, smoke and laughter. Investigators believe Mr. Rahami bought some of the materials he used to make bombs on eBay between June 20 and Aug. 10 under the name “ahmad rahimi. ” On July 12, that user bought an electric igniter for a fireworks system. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that “an analysis of the 27th Street bomb identified numerous electric igniters inside. ” On July 31, the user bought a circuit board, which the authorities said could be used in explosive devices. On Aug. 10, the user bought what authorities believe to be citric acid, which was described on the online auction site as being “great for bath bombs and candy making. ” The F. B. I. described citric acid as a precursor for improvised explosives. On various dates, the user bought items listed as milling balls and slingshot ammo, which investigators said could be used to increase a bomb’s fragmentation. The items were shipped to a business where Mr. Rahami worked. The complaint describes a handwritten journal investigators say they recovered from Mr. Rahami during his arrest. They said the journal includes references to slaughter in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine and Syria concern about being apprehended by the F. B. I. and the Department of Homeland Security and references to “jihad,” “pipe bombs” and a “pressure cooker bomb. ” It also includes “laudatory” writing about the   cleric Anwar   Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who killed 13 people in Fort Hood, Tex. and “Brother Osama bin Laden.” The document ends with the following: “Inshallah [God willing] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death to your OPPRESSION. ” A YouTube account under a name the authorities linked to Mr. Rahami includes, on a page of favorites, what they describe as two   videos, as well as Afghan wedding songs, a model aircraft compilation and the viral video “Charlie Bit My Finger  —   Again!” The explosive in Chelsea was so powerful that it propelled the Dumpster it was under more than 120 feet, shattering windows as far as 400 feet away and three stories high. Fragmentation from the bomb, which was packed with ball bearings and steel nuts, was found more than 650 feet away.   people were injured, two more than were initially reported, the report said. Investigators recovered 12 fingerprints from the unexploded bomb on 27th Street, which F. B. I. agents matched to Mr. Rahami. They also say they matched fingerprints from materials inside the backpack used for the bomb at the train station in Elizabeth to Mr. Rahami. The injuries included lacerations to the face, stomach, legs and arms from flying glass and metal shrapnel and fragmentation embedded in skin and bone. One woman had multiple ball bearings removed from her body, metal from her ear and splintered wood from her neck. Another victim, a man who was driving by the bomb site, was knocked unconscious by the explosion. A video shows a man pulling a suitcase on West 27th Street about two minutes after the West 23rd Street explosion. That man, who investigators believe to be Mr. Rahami, returns shortly thereafter into the camera’s view, without the suitcase.",0

It looks like President-elect Trump’s HISTORIC WIN is great for his business! 
Donald Trump bested Hillary Clinton on election day (well the next day, actually) with the political “comeback” of our lifetime! 
Trump has seen a 20% increase in hotel bookings at some of his most prominent hotels. 
From Fox News : 
Bookings at Trump hotels in Washington, DC, and New York — which plunged during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign — have spiked since his victory. 
The Trump International Hotel Washington, DC, just blocks from the White House, has seen a 20 percent increase in reservations and is sold out for Inauguration Day weekend in January. 
“Wow. Demand is definitely up,” said Jack Ezon, president of Manhattan-based travel agency Ovation Vacations. “I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly.” 
Bookings at the Trump International Hotel & Tower New York are up 18 percent since Election Day, and there has been a 15 percent rise at the Trump Soho New York, Ezon told The Post. 
A check on the Expedia travel site Thursday showed the Trump New York was sold out for Friday night, while similarly priced hotels, like The Plaza and The Mark, had vacancies. Rooms were available at the Trump Soho for about $500. 
But reservations at other Trump-branded hotel and resorts remained virtually unchanged. Amy Moreno is a Published Author , Pug Lover & Game of Thrones Nerd.

[The petition asks university leadership to decline the invitation to perform. The petition reads, “As either proud residents of Tennessee or proud University of Tennessee alumni, we are greatly disturbed by the behavior exhibited by Donald Trump both during and after the recent presidential campaign. He has made racist and sexist remarks that should never come out of the mouth of someone in public office  …    we believe the attendance at the upcoming inauguration of a band representing the state of Tennessee would condone this behavior,” said the petition. ”  Donald Trump won 94 of the 95 counties in Tennessee during the Republican primary in addition to trouncing Hillary Clinton there during the general election. So, the idea that the “proud residents” of Tennessee would clutch their proverbial pearls and take great issue with the Tennessee band representing the Volunteer State seems a bit more than laughable. According to the AP, Marist College and Talladega College have also experienced some resistance to the idea of taking part in the inauguration. Somehow, despite potentially not having the bands of Marist, Talladega College, and Tennessee, Donald Trump will have to find a way to become president.

Medical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations – Should Their Views be Silenced? eBook – Available for immediate download. 
One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all “quacks.” 
However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding “the science” of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. 
The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary. 
Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. 
In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves “pro-vaccine,” for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. 
Many doctors recommend a “delayed” vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. 
These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. 
In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

[In her address to the Council in Geneva —  the first by a U. S. Permanent Representative —  Haley renewed the U. S. commitment to human rights and, in particular, its commitment to women’s rights.   “There is no room here for cultural relativism,” she said: . @NikkiHaley: US will not sit quietly while this body, supposedly dedicated to #humanrights, continues to damage the cause of human rights. pic. twitter.   —   Department of State (@StateDept) June 6, 2017,  The U. S. has had a tense relationship with the Council since Trump took office, particularly over the Council’s   bias and its membership, which includes countries with poor human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Cuba. The U. S. has mulled leaving the Council for months and boycotted its opening session in March due to the   agenda. While Haley told the Council that the U. S. is “looking carefully” at U. S. participation in the body, she refrained from giving an outright ultimatum in her address. She did point to a side event on human rights abuses in Venezuela and warned the socialist country that it should step away from the Council if it cannot end its abuses. “If Venezuela cannot, then it should voluntarily step down from its seat on the Human Rights Council until it can get its own house in order,” she said. “Being a member of this council is a privilege, and no country who is a human right violator should be allowed a seat at the table. ” She then drew a contrast with the way the Council treated Venezuela and the way it treated Israel. “It’s hard to accept that this Council has never considered a resolution on Venezuela, and yet it adopted five biased resolutions in March against a single country —  Israel,” she said. “It is essential that this Council address its chronic   bias if it is to have any credibility. ” Later Tuesday, Haley was scheduled to make an address to the Geneva Graduate Institute, where she said she will outline a plan to make the Council “more effective, more accountable and more responsive. ” Haley’s address comes days after she penned a withering   in the Washington Post in which she blasted the body as a “haven for dictators. ”  The Bush administration boycotted the Human Rights Council when it was formed in 2006 as a successor to the Human Rights Commission, which was also criticized for   bias and its membership.

Montrealâs Concordia University has confirmed a professor has been âremoved temporarilyâ as officials âassess the situationâ after someone allegedly made racist comments during a classroom lecture. 
Global News spoke to two students who were in the classroom when the allegedly racist comments were made. They asked not to be identified because they fear reprisals from the university. 
Yeah, I’m sure the university would enact reprisals against students for being anti-racists. They’re well known to be Nazi sympathizers, after all. A rare picture of the Concordia University board of directors. 
In an online post, a student at the John Molson School of Business (JMSB) described what allegedly happened on Oct. 21. 
According to the post on the private John Molson School of Business Facebook page, part-time lecturer Roumen Solov said during a class that after the Second World War, Jewish people came to New York City and âgot high education, but black people are not educated.â 
Concordia University is investigating the matter. Uneducated? smdh. 
âWeâve interviewed the students and the professor and he has been removed temporarily while we assess the situation,â ClĂŠa Desjardins, a spokesperson for the university told Global News. 
Solov also allegedly singled out the only black student in the room. 
She told Global News she challenged Solov after his comments and said it sounded like he was saying black people were lazy and not interested in education. 
According to her, Solov then tried to clarify by saying slavery prevented black people from getting access to education. 
In other words, he said Blacks were oppressed by Whites because of slavery, and thus didn’t have access to higher education. Sounds pretty much like standard SJW rhetoric to me, no? 
Some students have started a petition to have Solov fired. 
Several hundred have signed so far. 
A spokesperson for the university said the issue should be resolved within the week. 
The endgame of the SJW movement is to enact public lynchings of every White man who even tries to address racial issues without immediately bending over backwards to apologize for being an evil oppressor of poor defenseless minorities. 
So yeah, they’re trying to get him fired. No surprise there. 
Some students have started a counter petition, on the other hand, to get this man a promotion.",0

22283,"Trump Called Edward Snowden a Traitor, Implied He Should Be Executed","
Sure, Hillary Clinton is a banshee nightmare from Hell, but that really doesn’t mean Donald Trump is automatically amazing just because literally anything is better than Hillary. That’s a pretty low bar.
Trump has assured us he’ll give a lot more power to Big Brother as if we aren’t already living in an Orwellian nightmare as it is. He has said that he will grow the police state, boost the Patriot Act, and extend the neverending wars (he keeps mentioning Iran specifically, because no matter who becomes president, they all know they have to sing that same old “Which Path to Persia?” tune). Once I even heard the man say he expects the NSA to be listening in to all our phone calls… guess that makes it okay???
ಠ_ಠ
Trump has also called Edward Snowden a traitor and implied that he should be executed.

He also banned Snowden from Miss Universe… which I’m sure must’ve really broken poor Edward’s heart.
Message to Edward Snowden, you’re banned from @MissUniverse . Unless you want me to take you back home to face justice!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2013 

While Snowden may be a limited hangout, that’s beside the point here. Without Snowden, we wouldn’t have so much hard physical evidence of just how much our Constitution has been trampled, our 4th Amendment has been run over, and our privacy has been rendered nonexistent in the cybernetic technological control grid we now find ourselves living in.
How is exposing the tyrannical government’s crimes against the people a traitorous act worthy of death?
And this talk of “justice”?
Real justice would be someone standing up for the Constitution and Bill of Rights and challenging Big Brother and the NSA surveillance state, something neither Trump nor Hillary ever planned to do.
Then again, Trump is the same guy who said he would “take out” the family members of terrorists. Do you have a criminal in the family? How would you like to be killed because your family member is a criminal? Same logic fail.
Like this government is honest about who the real terrorists even are anyway. Come on. If we’re to believe Trump is that naive, he shouldn’t go anywhere near the oval office.
Then again, how does the saying go? Everyone that would make a truly good president is smart enough to realize they’d never want to be president? Not that presidents are really running anything in this country anyway…
Sigh.
. @realDonaldTrump yes, I’m sure Edward Snowden would take it all back if he’d known he’d eventually be banned from @MissUniverse .

22285,Truancy crackdown 'Operation Round Up' hunts homeschoolers,"Truancy crackdown 'Operation Round Up' hunts homeschoolers   Source: One News Now 
Homeschool students in Florida’s Jackson County are being hunted down in a countywide initiative called “Operation Round Up,” which was launched by local school board officials to enroll more children in pubic schools. 
After watching a television interview featuring the Jackson County School Board’s director of student services – who called on the community to report any suspected truant students to her – one homeschool family sought legal advice out of fear that the public school was aggressively and specifically targeting homeschool students. 
Crackdown on homeschoolers 
Anxiety over the matter was validated by the director when she implied that many homeschoolers are really not being educated by their parents. 
“[Homeschooling families are] not set on a particular schedule, so sometimes the community will see them around town, and they think, ‘Hey, they aren’t being educated?’” the leader of the Jackson County School Board asserted during a televised news interview on the local WHJG station . “Sometimes the community is right.” 
Not stopping there, the local television station went on to insinuate that homeschooling is a disservice to children, urging members of the community to support the local schools by launching their own crackdown on homeschoolers. 
“[The] school board still encourages people to speak up with their suspicions [about homeschoolers],” the WHJG report announced across Jackson County. 
Inciting suspicion 
When apprised of the warning and incited crackdown, the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) stepped into the matter. 
HSLDA Staff Attorney Tj Schmidt promptly informed the director of the Jackson County School Board, as well as the superintendent of Jackson County schools, that their approach through the problematic Operation Round Up was troubling and needed to be addressed immediately to alleviate local homeschoolers’ concerns. 
“Your statements suggest that everyone should report children they think aren’t being educated,” Schmidt wrote in his letter to the school officials, according to HSLDA . “In our opinion, this is a threatening practice, and will instill a spirit of suspicion and hostility against homeschoolers in the community.” 
In order to put an end to the misinformation and ill-advised crackdown on homeschoolers, Schmidt proceeded to offer information to Jackson County officials and residents – and anyone participating in Operation Round Up – so that they would be able to properly interact with local homeschooling families and maintain respect for their parental rights to educate their own without undue interference. 
Don’t let them get away with it … 
Attorneys with the nonprofit Christian legal organization are confident that the letter submitted by Schmidt will work to educate the community and improve the relationship between local public school officials, residents and homeschooling families countywide. 
According to HSLDA, Operation Round Up and other ill-intended and misguided attempts to boost public school revenues – orchestrated to bring in more homeschoolers and increasing attendance – must be reported to legal experts. It maintains that such vigilance must be exercised in order stop the government’s monopoly on education from winning its war against homeschooling … and anything else that falls outside of its over-regulated system.

22286,WE TOLD HER! Budweiser Hits “DELETE” On Beer Ads Featuring Amy Schumer Because…,"0 comments 
Well, here’s a lesson for ya! Comedy and politics DON’T mix! So if you’re a comedian and you want to be successful- don’t bring politics into your act! Seriously, it just kills the mood, no one will be up to laughing after you insult them over who they are supporting for President, or whether or not they view abortion as murder. 
Who would find any humor in that? 
This should be common sense, but for Amy Schumer …twas not. Now she’s learning the hard way, what many of us were warning her about for a while now! 
According to AdWeek, Budweiser came in under expected profits in their third quarter, prompting the company to pull the Schumer ads ahead of schedule. The ads themselves were not at all doing well, and the last one received such negative attention on YouTube that it currently has more than 1,900 “thumbs down,” compared to only 300 “thumbs up.” 
Fox News reported that, at one time, the YouTube video had comments disabled, but that has since been changed. Many comments are negative toward Schumer herself, who has recently been in traveling around promoting feminist ideals and social justice causes. 
Schumer’s attitude on politics has alienated many people over the past few years, however. Many would say that the comedian’s negative views on men, and hypocritical outrage, is often in complete contrast with inclusivity. This could have further attributed to the decline in Bud Light’s sales, as having a wildly unpopular figure represent your product will devalue it to the public. 
Sorry Schumer. Either be a comedian, or a social justice warrior…the two however, do not play well together. Somewhere along the line you got that very obvious truth, twisted. Related Items",0
22289,"Liberals Brag With Pic Of Hillary, FURIOUS At What Snuck In Behind Her","Liberals Brag With Pic Of Hillary, FURIOUS At What Snuck In Behind Her Posted on November 1, 2016 by Alisha Rich in Politics Share This 
It’s been a rough week for crooked Hillary Clinton, and things only seem to be getting worse. She’s panicking behind closed doors, and things are now spiraling out of control after a popular liberal newspaper attempted to brag about the presidential hopeful by using a picture of her in Florida. However, liberals were left furious when they realized what snuck in behind her in the photo. 
Hillary Clinton stopped at an early voting location to do a little last-minute campaigning in Pompano Beach, Florida. When The New York Times obtained a picture of Hillary at the event, they decided to run the picture in their newspaper. However, the editors made one massive mistake that left them not only furious but embarrassed as to what they had accidentally published behind Hillary in the picture 
According to The Gateway Pundit , “You know the wheels are falling off your crooked campaign when the far left NY Times” publishes a picture of Hillary Clinton surrounded by Trump supporters. At least six Trump signs can be seen in the photo, making them hard to miss, but liberals have been known to turn a blind eye to obvious things, such as the dirty deeds of their crooked candidate. 
As Mad World News has previously reported, Hillary’s problems only got worse when those Trump supporters were heard chanting three brutal words, “Lock her up.” Of course, she chose to ignore their bold statement and focused on her few supporters who were in attendance and were mildly excited for her presence. 
Clearly, Hillary Clinton’s campaign is imploding and her chances of being elected as the next president are getting smaller and smaller on a daily basis. Obviously, it’s her own fault. 
Perhaps if she had learned how to be a bit more honest and a lot less corrupt, she wouldn’t have anything to worry about from the FBI or the American voters. However, that’s not the case for the crooked Clinton, and it’s becoming a no-brainer that Donald Trump is going to be in the Oval Office, working to make America great again.",0
22293,Player Makes First Contact with Hidden Aliens in ’Elite: Dangerous’ - Breitbart,"Two years after the launch of   Elite: Dangerous, a player has had a close encounter with mysterious alien lifeforms. [Until now, series creator and Frontier Developments CEO David Braben has done little more than taunt   fans of Elite with a simple answer to any questions about the existence of a hidden alien menace from earlier games in the series: “They are coming. ”  In an online galaxy of 400, 000, 000, 000 stars, there’s a whole lot of space in which the creatures might hide. But finally, two years from the debut of the massive online universe, one intrepid explorer has instead been found. The player, “DP Sayre,” was pulled out of “witchspace” during travel, disabled, and apparently scanned by a strange craft with an almost organic appearance. Just after it happened, the official Elite: Dangerous twitter tweeted a brief message, along with a link directly to DP Sayre’s XboxDVR page: A report just coming through that a CMDR has experienced something  …     strange. https:  .   —   Elite Dangerous (@EliteDangerous) January 5, 2017,  There is little doubt that these are the legendary Thargoids, “an insectoid alien race who are said to originate outside of known space,” according to the Elite: Dangerous wiki. The creatures are speculated to have come from another dimension, and in the past have been exclusively hostile to players. But this is only the latest in a virtual world steeped in mystery. From unknown artifacts to ship diagrams and spectrographic codes, Frontier has given players enough breadcrumbs to fuel an independent subreddit. And in a gaming climate in which developers are inclined to purposely make sure that nothing is ever truly out of a player’s reach, Frontier’s cryptic   approach to the Thargoid reveal is both refreshing and genuinely compelling. It will be interesting to see what happens from here. So far,   artifacts have played with the ships upon which they’re carried and shut down entire space stations with their mere presence. Other than confirming the legitimacy of the footage with their tweet, the developers have maintained their silence. If the past two years are any indication, they’re more than content to allow their players to have the spotlight as events unfold.

22294,Senior Haaretz Correspondent Uses New Yorker Satire Piece As Journalistic Source In Jared Kushner Takedown,"TEL AVIV  —   Israel’s   daily Haaretz published a column this week claiming President Donald Trump’s    Jared Kushner, boasted that his knowledge of the Middle East was picked up while waiting for ski lifts. The source for this gem of information? A satire column written for the New Yorker. [Amir Oren, Haaretz’s senior correspondent, columnist and a member of its editorial board, published a column Sunday entitled “From the Passport Stamp Controversy to Trump’s   . ”  In it, Oren wrote: Foreign visitors stream to the White House, but there is an embarrassing emptiness there behind the power of Trump’s    adviser, Jared Kushner, who boasted that, while waiting to board ski lifts on vacation, he read up on the Middle East on his smartphone. As blogger Elder of Ziyon noted, the basis of Oren’s claim comes from a hilarious  —   and very     —   column written in the New Yorker by comedian and satirist Andy Borowitz: BAGHDAD (The Borowitz Report)  —   Jared Kushner said on Tuesday that he became “incredibly  ” on the Middle East by reading up on the region while waiting for the ski lift on a recent trip to Aspen. “There would be times when you’d have to wait five or even ten minutes for the ski lift, and that’s when I’d take out my phone and read up on the Middle East,” he said. “I really got into it. ” Kushner said that the Middle East was a “truly fascinating region” because of “all the countries that they have there. ” “There is Israel, and Egypt, but there is also Yemen and places like that,” he said. “Sometimes I would start learning about a new country, but then the ski lift would come. ” Kushner said that, during a meeting on Monday in Baghdad, he “wowed” the Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider   with knowledge that he had gleaned about the nation while waiting for the ski lift. “I told him that Iraq’s main agricultural products include wheat, barley, corn, and rice,” he said. “He seemed really surprised that I would know things like that. ” “Something else that’s interesting about the Middle East is there is a country called Jordan,” he added. Haaretz later updated the aforementioned paragraph to read thusly (emphasis added): Foreign visitors stream to the White House, but there is an embarrassing emptiness there behind the power of Trump’s     Jared Kushner. The senior adviser boasted that (according to reports that some say were satirical) while waiting to board ski lifts on vacation, he read up on the Middle East on his smartphone. Later still the article was updated a third time (it’s worth noting that none of the amendments were mentioned in an disclaimer endnote) this time reading: Foreign visitors stream to the White House, but there is an embarrassing emptiness there behind the power of Trump’s     Jared Kushner. The senior adviser was ridiculed as ostensibly taking a crash course on the Middle East while waiting for ski lifts on vacation. The last sentence hyperlinks to another Haaretz article that has no mention whatsoever of Kushner’s   habits. The   version sticks to amendment number two, perhaps assuming that its readers won’t know or won’t bother to find out who Andy Borowitz is.",0
22296,Thomas Jefferson: Government’s Role is Defense of God-Given Rights - Breitbart,"When declaring independence from King George III’s tyrannical rule, Thomas Jefferson wrote that men are born with   “unalienable rights,” and the government’s duty is to protect those rights. [This   comes as news to Senators Chris Murphy ( ) Joe Manchin ( ) and the whole Democrat Party, almost every member of which is focused on using the expansive powers of government to chip away at   rights rather than protect them.  For example, on August 6, 2013, Breitbart News quoted Murphy saying, “The Second Amendment is not an absolute right, not a   right. It has always had conditions upon it like the First Amendment has. ” Murphy is wrong in at least three places: 1. Second Amendment rights are  . 2. They are “absolute” because they were given by Him who is absolute. 3. First Amendment rights are absolute as well (as they, like all unalienable rights, have their origin in God, not government). As for the “absolute” nature of these rights, William Blackstone explained: The absolute rights of man, considered as a free agent, endowed with discernment to know good from evil, and with power of choosing those measures which appear to him to be most desirable, are usually summed up in one general appellation, and denominated the natural liberty of mankind. This natural liberty consists properly in a power of acting as one thinks fit, without any restraint or control, unless by the law of nature: being a right inherent in us by birth, and one of the gifts of God to man at his creation, when he endued him with the faculty of  . Note: “absolute rights” have limits but they are not limits put in place by government, rather, they are limits inherently present in “the law of nature” and evident in the order of nature. For example, my right to keep and bear arms is “absolute” but natural protections on it end if I use my guns —  or try to use my guns —  to take innocent life. Moreover, my right to life —  one of the most fundamental of natural rights —  ends if I use my Second Amendment rights to take the life of an innocent or am in the act of the trying to take that life. Government gun control does not do this. In fact, gun control is not even necessary to it. Rather, nature teaches us these things and the laws of man reflect it in statutes against murder and attempted murder and by laws that shield   citizens who kill attackers in  . This all comes together in Jefferson, who wrote: We hold these truths to be   that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. —  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. We are born with “certain unalienable rights. ” The fact that they are “unalienable” means they cannot be separated from us they are part of our humanity. And it is government’s duty to “secure these rights,” not to regulate or in anyway diminish them. Therefore, when the Second Amendment says, “The right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed,” we must understand that it is incumbent on government to shield that right from infringement.

22297,An Ode to ‘the Purple One’: Prince’s Most Memorable Albums - The New York Times,"Prince released music steadily from 1978 on, making for one of the most daring, radical and inventive catalogs in all of pop. Here are five of his finest albums, released at   moments in his career, that show the artist, who was found dead, at 57, on Thursday, in his fullness: a cunning vocalist, a fiery musician, and a peerless songwriter and producer. This was Prince’s third album, but the first on which his lusty   experimentalism was operating at full sweat levels. Playing and producing almost the whole album himself, he created a universe of unbridled id, from the hunger of “When You Were Mine” to the   incestual drive of “Sister,” while also creating a   hybrid of new wave, flashy rock and   soul. Here is Prince at his orchestral best: “Purple Rain” is the first album he released with his backing band, the Revolution, and the one that cemented him as one of pop music’s essential stars. “Purple Rain” is glorious, ecstatic, piercing, with anthems of quiet desperation (“When Doves Cry”) boundless energy (“Let’s Go Crazy”) or both (“I Would Die 4 U”). Though the album was designed as a soundtrack for the film of the same name, it stands as one of the most important records in pop history. Here is Prince collecting material recorded over several years, showing off how his flamboyant, daring skill could tackle almost any sound or attitude of the day. The title track addressed a litany of societal ills, and “If I Was Your Girlfriend” represented Prince at his carnal best. But those were only two extremes on an album full of them, one that showed the full scale of his ambition. By this stage of his career, Prince wasn’t as loose as he’d been in his early days, but he found ways of   his erotic impulses, which weren’t weakened at all. On this album  —   his first billed with the New Power Generation, then his backing band  —   he made   pop “Cream,” sly   on “Willing and Able” and clangorous   on “Gett Off. ”   Prince could be a hodgepodge  —   after he split with his record label Warner Bros. in the   he pinballed among styles, releasing music at an idiosyncratic clip. “Musicology,” an album that is jubilant and grounded in Prince’s   sonics, marked his return to the major label system, and also to controlled form. He also gave away copies of the album to people who bought tickets to his tour, showing that his skepticism of typical   practices remained high.",0

The announcement of an exercise to be held in parts of the South China Sea was posted on China’s Maritime Safety Administration website. Read more ‘Illegal & provocative’: US destroyer sails through contested waters amid Chinese warnings 
Without disclosing the details of the drills, the maritime authority provided the coordinates for the maneuvers, which are planned for Thursday. It also ordered civilian vessels to stay away from the waters just south of Hainan island and northwest of the disputed island chain in the South China Sea. 
The announcement of the drills, which are quite routine in the disputed waters, comes less than a week after USS Decatur conducted a “freedom of navigation” sail-by near the disputed Spratly or Paracel Islands, through which some $5 billion dollars’ worth of trade passes through each year. 
“USS Decatur (DDG 73) conducted this transit in a routine, lawful manner without ship escorts and without incident on October 21,” Pentagon spokesman Commander Gary Ross told the Navy Times. “The United States conducts these routine operations on a regular basis around the world, in full compliance with international law.” 
The US operation last Friday was the fourth “ freedom of navigation” maneuver conducted in the past year by Washington. The move, as always, drew strong response and criticism from Beijing. 
According to the Chinese Defense Ministry, as the USS Decatur was “trespassing"" by the islands it was approached by at least two Chinese vessels. The People’s Liberation Army Navy ships repeatedly warned the US warship to leave, as they escorted USS Decatur from waters claimed by China. Read more US to hold joint drills with Philippines despite Duterte's scandalous outbursts 
Calling the American sail-by a “serious offense” and “aggressive behavior,” China accused the US intentionally sending US warship to Chinese territorial waters “without permission.” 
“We strongly urge the US side to respect China’s sovereignty and national security concerns. Do not repeat the mistakes again,” Chinese Defense Ministry said . 
At the same time, Beijing vowed to increase military air and sea patrols, as well as to strengthen the defense capacity to better protect the country's national sovereignty and security. 
The Spratly Islands are comprised of more than 750 islets and reefs off the coastlines of Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and China, with all the claimants having their own national names for the archipelago. 
China has a strong military presence on the archipelago concentrated around Woody Island, where Beijing maintains a runway and an arsenal of surface-to-air missiles. Beijing continues to claim the reefs in defiance of a Hague International Arbitration Court verdict this summer.",0

22307,"Blame Government, Not Markets, for Monopoly","Blame Government, Not Markets, for Monopoly Written by Ron Paul Email 
When Time-Warner announced it planned to merge with another major communications firm, many feared the new company would exercise near-total monopoly power. These concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both Time-Warner's competitors and consumers. 
No, I am not talking about Time-Warner’s recent announced plan to merge with AT&T, but the reaction to Time-Warner’s merger with (then) Internet giant AOL in 2000. Far from creating an untouchable leviathan crushing all competitors, the AOL-Time-Warner merger fell apart in under a decade. 
The failure of AOL-Time-Warner demonstrates that even the biggest companies are vulnerable to competition if there is open entry into the marketplace. AOL-Time-Warner failed because consumers left them for competitors offering lower prices and/or better quality. 
Corporate mergers and “hostile” takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors. These managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with affordable, quality products. Thus, laws making it difficult to launch a ""hostile"" takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm investors, workers, and consumers. 
Monopolies and cartels are creations of government, not markets. For example, the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees. Similarly, anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal regulations, they must sign a “franchise” agreement with their local government. Fortunately, the Internet has given Americans greater access to news and ideas shut out by the government-licensed lapdogs of the ""mainstream"" media. This may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web. 
Government taxes and regulations are effective means of limiting competition in an industry. Large companies can afford the costs of complying with government regulations, costs which cripple their smaller competitors. Big business can also afford to hire lobbyists to ensure that new laws and regulations favor big business. 
Examples of regulations that benefit large corporations include the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulations that raise costs of developing a new drug, as well as limit consumers ability to learn about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals. Another example is the Dodd-Frank legislation, which has strengthened large financial intuitions while harming their weaker competitors. 
Legislation forcing consumers to pay out-of-state sales tax on their online purchases is a classic case of business seeking to use government to harm less politically-powerful competitors. This legislation is being pushed by large brick-and-mortar stores and Internet retailers who are seeking a government-granted advantage over smaller competitors. 
Many failed mergers and acquisitions result from the distorted signals sent to business and investors by the Federal Reserve’s inflationary monetary policy. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the AOL-Time-Warner fiasco, which was a direct result of the Fed-created dot.com bubble. 
In a free market, mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices. Any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices and/or higher quality. Monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of well-connected crony capitalists. Therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the regulations, taxes, and subsides that benefit politically-powerful businesses. The most important step is to end the boom-bust business cycle by ending the Federal Reserve.

The playwright David Henry Hwang is making significant revisions to the script for the revival, incorporating recent discoveries about the relationship between Bernard Boursicot, who was an embassy worker, and Shi Pei Pu, a man whom Mr. Boursicot had believed for years to be a woman. The two were convicted of espionage in 1986. They were pardoned a year later. Mr. Owen, a British actor (“Closer”) will play the diplomat, named Rene Gallimard in the play. The play will be his second on Broadway  —   he made his Broadway debut in a 2015 revival of “Old Times,” by Harold Pinter. The role of the singer, named Song Liling in the play, has not yet been cast. The revival will mark Ms. Taymor’s first return to Broadway since “ : Turn Off the Dark,” a troubled production from which she was dismissed. She is best known as the creative genius behind the stage adaptation of “The Lion King,” for which she won two Tony Awards in 1998, for direction and costume design, and which is still going strong on Broadway and in productions around the world. Her most recent Off Broadway productions, including “Grounded” at the Public Theater and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” at Theater for a New Audience, won significant critical praise. The “M. Butterfly” revival, produced by Nelle Nugent, Steve Traxler, Kenneth Teaton, Benjamin Feldman and Doug Morris, the chief executive of Sony Music, is scheduled to open on Oct. 26 at an unspecified theater.",0
22310,BREXIT! PM Signs Official Letter to Brussels Beginning Britain’s Departure from the European Union,"LONDON, March 28 (Reuters)  —   Prime Minister Theresa May will file formal Brexit divorce papers on Wednesday, pitching the United Kingdom into the unknown and triggering years of uncertain negotiations that will test the endurance of the European Union. [Nine months after Britons voted to leave, May will notify EU Council President Donald Tusk in a letter that the UK really is quitting the bloc it joined in 1973.  The prime minister, an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the political turmoil that followed the referendum vote, will then have two years to settle the terms of the divorce before it comes into effect in late March 2019. “Now that the decision has been made to leave the EU, it is time to come together,” May will tell lawmakers, according to comments supplied by her office. “When I sit around the negotiating table in the months ahead, I will represent every person in the whole United Kingdom  —   young and old, rich and poor, city, town, country and all the villages and hamlets in between,” May will say.

22311,Donald Trump: Wall Construction Will Start ’as Soon as We Can Physically Do It’ - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump vowed to start his “big beautiful” wall on the Southern border of the United States immediately during an interview with ABC News anchor David Muir. [When asked for the construction date, Trump said that he would begin the project “as soon as we can physically do it” and confirmed that planning would start “immediately. ” He predicted, however, that the actual construction process might take a few months to begin.  The president will travel this afternoon to the Department of Homeland Security to sign several executive orders that deal with border security. Trump confirmed that ultimately Mexico would pay for the wall, but that the government would get the project started. He also dismissed Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto for insisting that his country would not pay for the wall. “I think he has to say that,” Trump replied, vowing that future negotiations with Mexico would ensure payment from the country. But he suggested that the wall would be good for Mexico too. “What I am doing will be good for the United States it’s also going to be good for Mexico,” Trump said. “We want to have a very stable, solid Mexico. ” The full interview airs tonight on ABC News at 10:00 p. m.

22312,Bishop Irate Over Mafia Kingpin’s Role as ‘Godfather’ in Baptism,"In a bizarre scene that could have been lifted from a Francis Ford Coppola film, the son of Sicilian Mafia boss Totò Riina returned to his native town of Corleone to stand as godfather in his niece’s baptism, an act now denounced by the local bishop. [Salvo Riina, who was released from prison in 2011 but prohibited from returning to Sicily, obtained special permission from the court to attend his niece’s baptism in his native town of Corleone, and furthermore convinced a Catholic priest in Padua to issue a declaration that Riina is a practicing Catholic in good standing and therefore a suitable godfather for the child.  On learning of the gangster’s role in the baptism, the bishop of Monreale, Michele Pennisi, stated Wednesday: “Neither I, nor the offices of the Curia were informed. Allowing the son of Riina to be the baptismal godfather was an imprudent and reprehensible choice, which I do not approve. ” The baptism was performed last December 29, but the circumstances only recently came to the attention of Bishop Pennisi, who is one of Sicily’s most vocal critics of Cosa Nostra, the local branch of the Italian Mafia. Salvatore “Totò” Riina ruled over Cosa Nostra from the early 1980s through the dramatic period of the early 90s, when he notoriously ordered the assassination of two antimafia prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. He was eventually arrested in 1993 and is serving several life sentences in an Italian   prison. Riina’s youngest son Giuseppe Salvatore (“Salvo”) reportedly killed his first victim before he turned 20, and was later arrested in 2002 and sentenced two years later for crimes of Mafia association, extortion,   and money laundering. Salvo Riina was released in 2011, but the district   prosecutor of Palermo forbade Riina from returning to Sicily, saying he had never interrupted his relations with Cosa Nostra. Since then, Riina has lived in the norther Italian city of Padua. The bishop of Monreale said he understood why the local priest accepted Riina as godfather for the baptism, since he had presented a valid certificate from his local pastor, “still, I will not change my mind about what happened,” he said. Bishop Pennisi recalled that the godfather “must be the guarantor of the faith and must give witness with his actions. ” “And I am not aware that the young man has ever expressed words of repentance for his conduct,” he said. Bishop Pennisi has announced that soon he will carry out a pastoral visit to Corleone. “We need clear words about the mafia,” he said. “Certain episodes are no longer tolerable. ” Follow Thomas D.

22313,Study: Swift birds fly non-stop for 10 months every year,"News Bulletin A common swift. 
A new study has revealed that a small bird known as the common swift can fly for 10 months without landing. The study in the US journal Current Biology has confirmed an old hypothesis that these birds spend most of their lives in the air. 
Scientists believe the birds which stop while flying does so only for a moment, and spent 99.5 percent of the 10 months in the air. They save energy during the day by sliding in upward currents of warm air.

22317,Catholic Bishop: Churches Should Not Shield Illegal Immigrants,"A Catholic Bishop is speaking out against the practice of parishes housing illegal aliens from federal immigration law. [In a letter to clergy, the Most Reverend Bishop Peter Libasci for the Diocese of Manchester says Catholic parishes should not be working against law enforcement, according to the Christian Post.  Libasci stated that the term “sanctuary church” was being misused by illegal immigration advocates. “Some use this term and mean what I have described above  —   a welcoming community ready to offer immediate aid to anyone in need. In these works, of course, we will always be involved,” Libasci wrote in the letter. “But others use this term ‘sanctuary’ to refer to churches that will allow individuals in fear of deportation to live in the church. ” Libasci went on to say that the propping up of sanctuary churches was creating a “false hope” for illegal immigrants who are trying to escape enforcement. “‘Sanctuary’ is not a designation recognized by law and provides no such legal protection,” Libasci continued. “Instead, immigration law imposes criminal penalties and fines on anyone who conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, in any place, an alien who has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of the law. ” The mainstream media has heralded the practice of churches harboring illegal immigrants wanted for crimes and other violations by ICE. In a piece in the New York Times, churches helping to shield illegal immigrants were referred to as “  immigrant sanctuaries,” Breitbart Texas reported at the time.

22319,Obama slams Trump's 'rigged' election claims as 'dangerous',"Email President Barack Obama admonished Donald Trump Thursday, saying the Republican nominee's claims that he might not accept the results of next month's election are ""not a joking matter."" ""I want everybody to pay attention here. This is dangerous,"" Obama said at a Hillary for America event in Miami Gardens, Florida. ""Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's mind about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you are doing the work of our adversaries for them."" Obama also encouraged the crowd of about 1,800 at Florida Memorial University to take advantage of Florida's early voting, telling the audience in doing so they can reject what the President called Trump's ""dark, pessimistic fear-mongering."" ""Our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters. That those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people,"" Obama said. On Wednesday night's debate Trump, answered, ""I will look at it at the time,"" when asked whether he would concede if he loses on November 8. ""I will keep you in suspense."" Trump also doubled down on Thursday in Ohio saying he will accept the results of next month's election as long as wins. Obama also used the opportunity while in Florida to weigh in on the close Senate race in Florida between Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy. ""Even Marco Rubio says there's no rigging of the vote,"" Obama said, ""Which I'd like to give credit for, except he's refuting the dangerous, unprecedented claims of a candidate he says he's still going to vote for!"" Earlier this week, Obama released a new ad for the Democrat in the Sunshine State, the same week it was announced the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was puling money for ads for Murphy.",0

Seeing is believing. That being said, this time with the release of the latest batch of Criminal Clinton’s, Weiner & Abedin emails, I think this time there’s enough to make the mud stick.

22322,Report: FCC Chairman Pai Planning a Fast Repeal of Net Neutrality,"Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai plans a quick repeal of the controversial net neutrality order and wants to replace it with lighter regulations intended to preserve an open internet. [Chairman Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, met with telecommunications groups on Tuesday to discuss his plans .  The net neutrality order, created by former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler back in early 2015, regulates the internet similar to a public monopoly. Net neutrality prohibited telecommunications companies from creating internet “fast lanes” that would ensure consistent Skype video chat, and   Netflix streaming. At the meeting, Pai suggested that internet service providers voluntarily agree to certain practices preserving an open internet. The Federal Trade Commission would then enforce compliance of these rules. Industry sources state that the FCC will unveil its plan to eliminate net neutrality as early as late April, a vote could come in May or June. Internet providers such as ATT and Verizon argued that net neutrality made it harder to manage web traffic and curtailed broadband investment. Net neutrality advocates worry that internet service providers might unfairly discriminate content. In December, Chairman Pai stated that net neutrality’s days were numbered. He said that he believes “in a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that. ”",0

22326,BREAKING! — Hillary Clinton looks like a goner!,"Wikileaks Just Released Her Full Isis Donor List With Names! 
WikiLeaks just finished the job that started few months ago! Hillary just got killed! She is not going to survive this! It’s too much! Pure treason! 
According to Conservative Daily Post: Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. 
After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. 
Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. 
An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: “Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region” to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of “providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” 
Citing the need to “use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,” said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were “important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.” 
Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary’s largest donations come from those two countries. 
In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 “birthday check.” 
The email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would “welcome the Clinton Foundation’s suggestions for investments in Haiti — particularly on education and health.” Desai added that while Qatar had already “allocated most of their $20 million … they were happy to consider projects we suggest.” Like this?

22329,FACEBOOK FACES HIGH PROFILE LAWSUIT REGARDING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ‘DEEPFACE’,"Home › MEDIA | US NEWS › FACEBOOK FACES HIGH PROFILE LAWSUIT REGARDING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ‘DEEPFACE’ FACEBOOK FACES HIGH PROFILE LAWSUIT REGARDING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ‘DEEPFACE’ 0 SHARES [10/27/16] As the technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous and far more accurate, facial recognition and the lack of any laws or regulations around the practice is slowly starting to enter mainstream consciousness. It’s a very important issue that isn’t getting the attention it deserves. 
For example, as I highlighted in the recent post, Half of American Adults Exist in a Government Accessible Facial Recognition Network : 
Half of all American adults are already in some sort of facial recognition network accessible to law enforcement, according to a comprehensive new study. 
Conducted over a year and relying in part on Freedom of Information and public record requests to 106 law enforcement agencies, the study , conducted by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology, found American police use of facial recognition technology is a scattered, hodgepodge network of laws and regulations. 
“Looking at the sum total of what we found, there have been no laws that comprehensively regulate face recognition technology, and there’s really no case law either,” Clare Garvie, an associate at the CPT, told Vocativ. “So we find ourselves having to rely on the agencies that are using that technology to rein it in. But what we found is that not every system — by a long shot — has a use policy.” 
With that in mind, Bloomberg published an interesting article yesterday covering a couple of lawsuits against Facebook and Google regarding their facial recognition practices. Post navigation",0
22331,‘Right Before Hitler Killed Himself’: Trump Insider Describes The Trump Campaign’s Final Days,"  
Trump’s chances of winning Tuesday’s election are pretty close to zero. Nearly everyone both inside and outside his campaign understands that, except him. Trump is a type A personality taken to extremes and he cannot accept failure. When faced with an actual loss (and in this case a humiliating national one), his mind creates a counter narrative that he can accept. Things are rigged. The race was stolen. Everyone is against him. 
I’m not just saying this because he looks crazy on TV. Plenty of people have come forward with some pretty horrific tales of what happens when Trump feels like he’s lost something. Even the littlest loss will set him into a tale spin of self-deception. Take Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter , who made an off-hand comment in Spy Magazine about Trump’s small hands. For the last 30 years he’s been receiving odd notes: 
To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him—generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby. 
Then there’s Selina Scott who also claims to have received weird little love notes from Trump calling her “sleazy” and suggesting she’s not a very good journalist. This after Trump tried and failed to seduce her. 
Trump also tried a similar tact with Selma Hayek; first he asked her out and then once she refused, he attacked. She says that he leaked a story to the National Enquirer that he turned her down because she was too short. (Later, he attempted to turn that smear into a positive by suggesting she go out with him to prove the story wrong. Classy.) 
That’s exactly what seems to be going on inside the Trump campaign right now. There’s a lot of anger and a lot of bizarre story-telling an anonymous Trump staffer told New York Magazine . He compares the atmosphere to what being in the bunker with Hitler must have been like just before he killed himself. People are all smiling at meetings and then returning to their offices to desperately search for work elsewhere. Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s newest campaign manager, is increasingly upset with him over his lack of strategy. Supposedly, before Paul Manafort left the Trump campaign he suggested that they try to keep Trump completely out of the public eye: 
The best thing we can do is to have you move into a cave for the next four months. If you’re not on the campaign trail, the focus is on her, and we win. 
In just over a week, Trump will have another loss to rationalize away. It’s likely to get pretty ugly and someone no doubt will receive some creepy news clippings in the mail. But just remember that not long ago this guy was actually neck and neck with Hillary Clinton. This bizarre sex-crazed business baby could have actually wound up being our next president. So congratulations America; but also, get your shit together.

22332,Border Patrol K9 Finds 30 Pounds of Meth,"A Border Patrol K9 agent in southwestern Arizona discovered 30 pounds of methamphetamine and other drugs at an inland border checkpoint. [The agents assigned to the Yuma Sector observed a Dodge pickup truck approach the Interstate 8 inland border checkpoint located east of Yuma, Arizona. During a cursory check of the truck, a K9 agent alerted to the possible presence of drugs, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesman Justin Kallinger.  The agents conducted a secondary inspection on the truck. The inspection led to the discovery of drugs hidden inside a spare tire, officials stated. Agents also found drugs hidden under the truck’s seats. The agents found 3 pounds of heroin, 2 pounds of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 30 pounds of methamphetamine. The agents arrested the driver of the Dodge pickup truck and identified him as a U. S. citizen. They did not disclose the driver’s identity in the official statement. Officials seized the truck and the drugs, estimated to be worth $327, 000 in street value. The suspect will be turned over to another federal law enforcement agency for possible prosecution under drug trafficking laws. This area is well known for drug trafficking and human smuggling. In March, Breitbart Texas reported on a serious crash that occurred after human smugglers attempted to flee Border Patrol agents. Border Patrol agents attempted to stop a vehicle on Highway 78, near State Road 2. The driver refused to yield and led the agents on a   chase. While attempting to evade arrest, the suspect lost control of his vehicle and rolled over. The driver received serious head trauma and torso injuries. His “human cargo” received minor injuries. Yuma Sector Border Patrol agents effectively combat smuggling organizations attempting to illegally transport people and contraband through southwestern Arizona and California, Kallinger stated. Citizens can help the Border Patrol and U. S. Customs and Border Protection by calling       to report suspicious activity. Callers can remain anonymous.

22333,Fastest electric commuter ferry unveiled in Sweden,"Fastest electric commuter ferry unveiled in Sweden Fri Oct 28, 2016 12:49AM News Bulletin The BB Green ferry, powered by LTO batteries. 
World's fastest electric commuter ferry has been unveiled in Sweden. This is a supercharged vessel capable of hitting top speeds of 56 kilometers per hour. The ferry can accommodate around 75 people, plus 15 bicycles. Engineers say its speed, range and low environmental impact will convince commuters to trade their daily drive for a waterborne journey. 
Instead of a chugging motor down in its hull, there's a humming 200 kilowatt hour lithium-ion battery bank. 
Those involved with the project believe the rapidly recharging batteries make it a competitive choice for a number of routes and commuter journeys. 
Key to the ferry's high speed is its unique air supported vessel technology that reduces water resistance by around 40 percent. Using an electric fan system and its unique hull shape, approximately 80 percent of the vessel's weight is supported on a cushion of air. Loading ...",0
22334,Obama's DOJ Hasn't Approved Warrant for FBI of New Hillary Emails,"Obama's DOJ Hasn't Approved Warrant for FBI of New Hillary Emails   
Lynch and Obama's corrupted DOJ have switched to overtly undermining the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton. Remember those Hillary emails that have come up in the Weiner investigation? 
As of Saturday night, the FBI had still not gotten approval from the Justice Department for a warrant that would allow agency officials to read any of the newly discovered Abedin emails, and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen. 
“We do not have a warrant,” a senior law enforcement official said. “Discussions are under way [between the FBI and the Justice Department] as to the best way to move forward.” 
This is Michael Isikoff so the spin is an attack on Comey. Though if Comey couldn't get Lynch to sign off on a warrant, the public announcement could very well have been his way of pressuring the DOJ to do the right thing. Now that the emails are an election issue, the only way to move forward is to allow the FBI to review them. 
But the Dems and the media are currently attacking Comey and the Isikoff piece is a typical example. Rather than tell the truth that the DOJ is obstructing the Hillary investigation, it's smearing the FBI instead. As so many have pointed out, imagine if Nixon had been a Democrat. This is the way the media would have covered Watergate. 
Meanwhile the Dems are also screaming that Comey tell them about the emails that they refuse to grant him access to.",0

In his Instagram post, the    Where to Invade Next director called on Democrats to impose a “halt to all business” being conducted by Trump, whom he called a “potential felony suspect. ” “No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation,” Moore wrote. “His presidency has no legitimacy until the FBI  —   and an independent investigative committee  —   discovers the truth.

The provinces of West Java and Aceh have taken similar measures. According to Reuters, authorities outright banned Valentine’s Day celebrations in some parts of Indonesia and Pakistan because it “encouraged casual sex and ran counter to cultural norms. ” In the city of Makassar, police raided stores and pulled condoms off the shelves, having received reports that “the minimarts were selling condoms in an unregulated way. ” Deutsche Welle quotes the mayor of Makassar complaining that condoms were sold “as if they were candy,” and warned shop owners they could lose their licenses if they sell condoms to unmarried people. There is an alarming political undercurrent to this  ’s Day push by Indonesian Muslims, as Deutsche Welle explains: Valentine’s Day this year falls a day before the capital, Jakarta, goes to the polls to elect a new governor in a vote widely viewed as a test of the country’s religious tolerance. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnically Chinese Christian, is running for   in a campaign marked by accusations that he insulted the Koran. The claims have led to hardline Islamic protests and a trial for blasphemy. The case has been criticized as unfair and politically motivated. Purnama is going up against two Muslim candidates, and his opponents have repeatedly urged people not to vote for him because he is not a Muslim. Tens of thousands of conservative Muslims have in recent weeks rallied at mosques against Purnama, whose lead in the polls has slipped. If he loses the vote because he is not a Muslim and is jailed for blasphemy, analysts say, it would be a blow to the country’s reputation as a pluralist democracy. Reuters notes that while the highest Islamic clerical council in Indonesia declared a fatwa (religious injunction) against Valentine’s Day in 2012 because they deemed the holiday “contradictory to Muslim culture and teachings,” Indonesian law protects religious diversity, and the holiday is still big business in cities like Jakarta. The Islamic Republic of Pakistan, by contrast, banned public Valentine’s celebrations in Islamabad and instructed media not to promote the holiday, to the dismay of florists.",0

A landslide on the main highway linking Colombia's two biggest cities has killed at least six people and trapped an unknown number under tons of earth. Antioquia state rescue chief Mario Parodi says four people were rescued and hospitalized after the Wednesday morning disaster covered all four lanes of the highway linking Bogota with Medellin. Rescuers with dogs joined the search for victims. Parodi said two motorcycles, a truck and two small vehicles were buried by the slide, which covered two football fields. He said the highway would be closed for several days. Landslides are not uncommon in Colombia's rugged mountainous terrain. Source: Associated Press",0
22348,Facebook Files Patent for Meme Analysis Engine - Breitbart,"A patent filed by Facebook detailing a proposed meme analysis engine has been uncovered. [Vipin Singh found the patent for “Meme Detection in Digital Chatter Analysis” while reading up on social media. The patent was filed on July 17th of 2015, and details a future system which would analyze memes by language and key words, then distribute them to their intended audience.  The abstract is as follows: Some embodiments include a method of detecting memes, as “key terms,” in a chatter aggregation in a social networking system. The method can include aggregating   content objects within the social networking system into the chatter aggregation according to a set of filters. A meme analysis engine can define a target group within the chatter aggregation to compare against a background group. The meme analysis engine can extract key terms from textual content of the target group. The meme analysis engine can determine a relevancy rank of a term in the key terms based on an accounting of the term in the textual content of the target group and a linguistic relevance score of the term according to a linguistic model. The engine works by identifying key terms within a meme, which can be one word or more, separating them from “irrelevant noise terms,” and using this to work out what exactly the meme is about. Key terms are then linked into different demographics, such as age, gender, location, and language. Figure 3 in the patent gives the example of US citizens aged   who like cars and trucks. Keywords such as “cars” “Camaro” and “Corvette” are considered relevant to the group, while other frequent terms such as “bad dog” are ignored. After releasing the memes, the engine can analyze how those users interact with the meme. Using machine learning, the engine should be able to pick up which memes were more successful and which did not do so well, in order to constantly refine and improve itself. The full patent can be read here. Jack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech. You can follow him on Twitter @ToryBastard_ or on Gab @JH.",0
22349,U.S. Consulate Official Shot and Wounded in Mexico - The New York Times,"MEXICO CITY  —   An official working at the United States consulate in Guadalajara, the   city in Mexico, was shot and wounded on Friday evening by a young man who stalked him in the parking lot of a shopping mall and then fired as he drove out. The State Department official, who was not identified, was in stable condition after the shooting, a spokeswoman from the United States Embassy in Mexico City said on Saturday. Neither embassy officials nor the Mexican attorney general’s office commented on a possible motive. Guadalajara is the capital of Jalisco, the headquarters of the New Generation Jalisco cartel, an organized crime gang that has carried out violent attacks on the Mexican military and police over the past two years. But residents of the city have rarely been a focus of cartel violence. Security footage released by the consulate on its Facebook page shows the gunman, dressed in a loosefitting dark blue   and pants and wearing glasses, waiting on the sidewalk adjacent to the exit ramp of an underground parking lot in an upscale neighborhood. A white car pulls up to the barrier gate, waits for the arm to lift and drives off. Then, as the consular official’s black car pulls up, the gunman raises his arm, fires and runs away. In a separate video, taken a few minutes earlier, at 6:16 p. m. the consular official, wearing red shorts and with a gym bag slung over his shoulder, pays at the automated ticket machine and walks off, with the gunman following him. The F. B. I. said it was offering a $20, 000 reward to anybody who could provide information leading to the identification of the gunman. “The safety and security of our employees overseas is our highest priority,” the United States Embassy spokeswoman said. Eduardo Almaguer, the attorney general for Jalisco, told the local news media that the consular employee worked in the visa section of the consulate. State and federal authorities are working on the investigation. Employees of the United States Embassy and consulates in Mexico have been victims of drug violence in the past few years, though they have sometimes been targeted by mistake. That was the case in 2010 of a consulate employee in the border city of Ciudad Juárez, her husband and the husband of another employee who were killed. The white S. U. V. that the employee and her husband were driving in was mistaken for the vehicle of a gang leader whose killing was ordered by a rival. In 2011, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was killed and another injured when they were ambushed by members of a drug gang hit squad on a highway. The next year, two C. I. A. employees were wounded when federal police officers fired at their armored car in an attack that has never been explained.",0

22354,Unhinged Trump Supporter Holds Children AT GUNPOINT Over Damaged Trump Sign (VIDEO),"on November 4, 2016 4:45 pm · 
If you had wanted to give Trump supporters the benefit of the doubt, this most recent incident proves that it’s far too much to give them. 
A 56-year-old man in Allen Park, Michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought they’d damaged the Donald Trump sign on his lawn. Yes, this is the kind of deranged, emotionally unstable supporters Trump has attracted. 
The man, Michael Robert Kubek, had called police on October 29th to report that his Trump sign had been hit by teenagers, who had fled the scene. When the police arrived at the scene, they didn’t find Kubek at his home – however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. 
The police saw Kubek standing over six children ages 12-14, who were sitting on the grass. Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. 
According to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock: Twitter Twitter 
The News-Herald reported: 
“The officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not. The officer then asked Kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. According to police, Kubek said “yes.” 
In response to another question from the officer, Kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered.” 
Yes, a grown man used a gun because he felt “outnumbered” by a small group of innocent kids. This is EXACTLY the type of unhinged person who shouldn’t be trusted with firearms! Kubek’s hearing is scheduled for December 5th – let’s hope that whatever happens to Kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner. You can watch a report below:

O seu Governo retoma assim o programa de formação de combatentes, ditos «moderados», que havia sido lançado pelo Presidente Obama, em 2014.
O Exército Livre Sírio havia sido criado pela França, em 2011, em torno do chefe líbio da al-Qaida, Abdelhakim Belhadj. A operação fora apresentada como uma ajuda aos desertores sírios chefiados pelo coronel Riad al-Asaad. Progressivamente os membros do ESL juntaram-se à al-Qaida. Em 2016, o rótulo do ESL foi ressuscitado pela Turquia que fez uso dele para as suas milícias turcomanas.
Os Estados Unidos tinham, quanto a eles, gasto metade de um bilião (bilhão-br) de dólares para a formação de novos «combatentes rebeldes». Entretanto, a totalidade de pessoas treinadas até ao dia de hoje juntaram-se à al-Qaida.
É pois muito provável que o novo programa britânico mascare uma nova ajuda à al-Qaida.

Jamie Otis [the man who destroyed Donald Trump’s Walk of Fame Star] is now in police custody and waiting to be formally booked at the Men’s Central jail in downtown L.A. The suspect in the early Wednesday morning destruction of Donald Trump ’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star was arrested by the LAPD at his home sometime around 7 AM today, sources confirm. 
Otis had planned to hold a press conference at 9:30 AM this morning on Hollywood Blvd at the location of the already being repaired Trump star . Accompanied by his lawyer, Otis was then going to head over to the Hollywood Police station and turned himself in, he told Deadline last night. 
With damages of over $400, the felony vandalism charge could see Otis in jail for up to 3-years and paying out fines of over $10,000 if found guilty.

22360,HGTV Fans Eager to Take Seminar with 'Flip or Flop' Hosts Ended Up Getting Total 'Scam',"Share on Twitter 
Anyone who has ever watched HGTV has surely come across real estate agents-turned-house flippers Tarek and Christina El Moussa: A photo posted by Flip or Flop ???? (@tarekandchristina) on Apr 13, 2016 at 11:23am PDT 
The stars of “Flip or Flop” have created a lucrative business, bringing in $10,000 for each episode, not to mention the money they make on the actual flip. 
But now the couple is now being accused of scamming people. 
For those unfamiliar with the show, it features the couple buying foreclosed homes in Orange County, CA, renovating them, and then putting them back on the market for a premium. 
Well, according to The Daily Mail, hopeful real estate investors attended a pricey series of seminars endorsed by the El Moussas, where they were told they would be learning the tricks of the trade that made the HGTV hosts rich. A photo posted by Flip or Flop ???? (@tarekandchristina) on Apr 15, 2016 at 3:49pm PDT 
Before enrolling, instructors enticed potential attendees by telling them that if they paid $1,997 for three days of classes and $1,000 for real estate software , they would learn how the star couple flips homes. 
They also would supposedly gain access to investors who could offer them cash to purchase their first investment. 
Instructors told people with poor credit scores and a weak job history that they were eligible candidates. 
People were even told that if they weren't able to sell their flipped home in a certain amount of time, they would receive a refund. A photo posted by Flip or Flop ???? (@tarekandchristina) on Apr 13, 2016 at 11:18am PDT 
But when people finally showed up to the costly seminar, neither of the hosts was anywhere to be found. 
Instead, the would-be real estate investors got a cheesy pre-recorded video of the El Moussas, followed by a sales pitch urging attendees to buy additional courses. 
Doug Stephens, a pastor and teacher from Havana, Florida, who paid and attended the course, was left extremely disappointed. He stated that attendees were not taught anything and were just given sales pitch after sales pitch: 
“They weren't really teaching at all.” A photo posted by Flip or Flop ???? (@tarekandchristina) on Apr 7, 2016 at 11:14am PDT 
Stephens wasn't the only person who felt this way. Numerous other attendees felt bamboozled as well. A photo posted by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on Jan 14, 2016 at 1:23pm PST 
Stephens said it was so bad that not only did instructors avoid answering his questions, but they asked the attendees to call their credit card companies and increase their credit limits. 
But that's not the worst part. 
On the final day, instructors allegedly tried to persuade them to buy more sessions—some of which cost nearly $30,000. A photo posted by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on May 11, 2016 at 4:45pm PDT 
Since the seminar, Zurixx LLC , the Utah-based company that runs the El Moussa educational seminars ( Success Path Education ), have received dozens of complaints. 
More and more people are calling the classes a ripoff. A photo posted by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on May 3, 2016 at 2:42pm PDT 
In response, Zurixx LLC has insisted that the complaints only represent a small portion of their attendees. 
The company showed over 2,300 letters where people praised them for the “life-changing experience.” 
The HGTV stars have yet to respond. ",0
22362,Dutch Elections: Pyrrhic Victory As Mainstream Party Clings to Power,"Wednesday’s Dutch general election saw a collapse of support for mainstream parties including the conservatives (VVD) and their coalition partners, Labour, but not enough to hand victory to insurgent movements like Geert Wilders’s Party for Freedom (PVV). [After polls closed at   Dutch time and in the early hours as half the votes had been counted, it was clear that Mr Wilders had not made the breakthrough polls just a fortnight before the vote he would, and that the Dutch incumbent Prime Minister Mark Rutte would likely be staying on.  Yet despite the position of Rutte’s VVD remaining the largest party, the election has seen a dramatic change in fortune for the traditional parties, which beyond a   drop for the conservatives saw the vote for the Labour party crash from 26 to 6 points. The shift means the   party, which has been a key member of the ruling coalition and controlled many government ministries, will likely lose around   of their members of parliament. These collapses in the mainstream parties have been a boon to smaller, newer parties which have been boosted in their stead. Mr Wilders’s PVV is projected to pick up at least four more seats, although that is dramatically less than the 15 extras he had hoped for. Most benefitting are the plethora of leftist parties in the Netherlands, including the surging   party, who are set to pick up ten extra seats out of the wreckage of the Labour party. Other notable achievers including the Denk (‘Think’ Party) founded by   former Labour politicians who launched the movement as Europe’s first     party. They are set to have three members of parliament, a success that may inspire migrants in other European nations. Despite the setback, Mr Wilders remained upbeat and bullish in a statement given to press early Thursday morning when he insisted that he is more influential than ever in Dutch politics and that his party were “among the winners” of the evening. Earlier in the evening, the PVV leader took to Twitter to declare that the prime minister hadn’t heard the last of him. Once the dust has settled from the vote, Dutch MPs will negotiate over potential ruling coalitions, which could take a number of forms. While Mr. Wilders is likely to command either the second or third largest group of MPs in the house, he may be frozen out of negotiations by centrist parties desperate to keep him out of power.  ",0

It is managed by our Editorial Board Afraid of What? The Woman Who Accused Trump of Raping Her at 13 Just Dropped Her Lawsuit By GPD on November 4, 2016 Bloom said earlier this week that Doe/Johnson didn’t appear at a planned press conference because she had received death threats and was in fear for her life. Illustration by Jim Cooke 
A woman who accused Donald Trump of raping her at a party when she was just 13 years old has voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit, according to court records. The woman, who has gone by the pseudonyms Jane Doe and Katie Johnson, was a no-show at a much hyped press conference earlier this week with celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom. Jezebel previously detailed the bizarre backstory behind two lawsuits Johnson filed against Trump and celebrity sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who she said also raped her at a party in 1994. A group of men worked for a year to push the rape allegations into the news, while preventing access to Johnson. No journalist has ever been able to speak to her directly in person or confirm her existence. However, her attorney, Thomas Francis Meagher of New Jersey, has told Jezebel he’s met with his client on several occasions and has gotten to know her “quite well.” 
According to court records, Johnson/Doe voluntarily dismissed the suit on the afternoon of November 4. No other information is provided in the filing.

22371,"Trump Supporters Didn’t Vote Because Of The Economy; It Was Racism, And Here’s PROOF","on November 13, 2016 4:03 pm · 
Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasn’t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it’s simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there’s proof. 
The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked “How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.” Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It’s VERY unlikely that whites aren’t getting jobs because minorities are, but that’s not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it’s “extremely likely” that minorities are taking jobs from white people. Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon . 
Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump’s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. 
Post election, this is what the study found: 
The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is “extremely likely” that whites can’t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is “not at all” likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is “extremely likely” people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don’t think that. 
More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are “violent.” 84 percent think that of Muslims. 
Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this: 
Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I’ve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. 
Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots’ claims go unchallenged.

Their total populations haves reduced by 81% during 42 years. The populations of terrestrial vertebrates have decreased by 38% and marine - by 36% in the same period. The report was based on the research data collected for 3,706 species of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.The researchers concluded that the most common threat to the vertebrates is either the loss or the deterioration of their natural habitats.""Wildlife is disappearing within our lifetimes at an unprecedented rate,"" said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International. ""We should not be deceived into thinking humanity can do without,"" he added.""Biodiversity forms the foundation of healthy forests, rivers and oceans. Take away the species , and these ecosystems collapse, along with clean air, water, food and climate services they provide us,"" Mr Lambertini also said. The experts predict that animal populations on Earth may decline by 67 percent by the end of this decade if humans do not take measures to curb the harmful effects of human activities on nature. Noteworthy, pollution-related diseases claim the lives of 5.5 million people every year. A half of this frightening number accounts for residents of China and India, scientists at the US-based company Health Effects Institutes said.The current level of air pollution in Delhi and Beijing may reach 300 micrograms per cubic meter of air, thus exceeding the limit 8-10 times. At the same time, North America, Western Europe and Japan have achieved great progress in the fight against air pollution in the last 50 years, creating cleaner fuel and engines, as well as reducing the consumption of coal. The main sources of pollution, according to the study, are emissions from electric power plants, factories, car exhausts, coal and firewood combustion products. The particles that the process of combustion produces remain in the air for a long time, thus posing danger to human health. In the capital of China, announcing the top ""red"" level of environmental hazard has become a commonplace event. Beijing was recognized one of the most polluted cities in the world.

22373,Trump Dedicates D.C. Hotel: 'The Future Lies With The Dreamers'," 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president.
Coming off of campaign events in Florida Tuesday and before he jetted off to North Carolina to resume his quest for the White House, Trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., built in the city’s historic Old Post Office building.
“Under budget and ahead of schedule. So important. We don’t hear those words so often, but you will,” said Trump , linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president. “Today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country.”

“My job is to look at undeveloped spaces and imagine what they could be,” he said. “These are spaces that have no hope, no future. But you need imagination and you need the ability to get them done and to unlock their potential, and to unlock the potential of the people working on those spaces and on those projects, and we have so many things we can do for our country.”
“The United States is great,” he said. “It’s great. Its people are great. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside of our reach. Don’t ever let anyone tell you it can’t be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.”
 
The fact that Trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction.

Republican strategist Steve Schmidt , who helped Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in his 2008 White House race, was among those who said Trump’s priorities were skewed.
“The walls are collapsing,” Schmidt said, referring to polls showing Trump behind. Trump has discounted those polls as inaccurate and pointed to others that show him leading.

You don’t take a time-out to tend to your business interests,” he said.
Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway suggested that a dose of perspective might be useful.
“He’s making a pit stop here in Washington and his under-budget, ahead-of-schedule hotel is really remarkable. It shows Americans the tangible accomplishments of Donald Trump. He’s somebody who builds things. He’s somebody who fixes things,” she said Wednesday on NBC’s Today show.
“And you know, respectfully, Hillary Clinton has time to go to an Adele concert and everybody thinks that’s really cool. Donald Trump stops off to unveil just an incredible, stunning piece of architecture, new hotel, first-class hotel, and everybody’s hair is on fire,” she said.
Conway dared anyone to find a candidate with a more active schedule than Trump.
“Hillary Clinton took five days off to prepare for one debate and everybody looked at that as some kind of noble exercise with 23 days to go. Nobody covered that as, where is she? Why doesn’t she campaign much? What is she doing? Where is she hiding?” Conway said. “He’s got the most active campaign schedule of the two candidates by far.”

22376,A Putin Opponent Is Doused in Green. He Makes It Work. - The New York Times,"During Russia’s surreptitious invasion of Crimea, much was made of the “little green men,” soldiers without insignia who turned out to be Russian regulars. On Monday there was a new green man  —   albeit one of a decidedly different political hue  —   the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was doused with a bright green liquid in the Siberian city of Barnaul by an unknown assailant who had pretended to shake his hand. Mr. Navalny wrote on his Facebook page that he initially feared an acid attack after feeling a burning sensation. But relief appears to have given way to exaltation after he realized that the bright green liquid not only would not harm him, but even made him look like a superhero  —   in his eyes, anyway. He can be seen mugging for the camera in a selfie taken after the fact. Referring to masked heroes in Hollywood films in a post on Twitter, he wrote: “I will be opening a headquarters in Barnaul as if I am from the film The Mask! Cool. Even my teeth are green!” Mr. Navalny, a charismatic critic of President Vladimir V. Putin, was a major driver of large street protests in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and has irked the Kremlin by shining a light on corruption. His bid to run for president of Russia was effectively derailed in February when a Russian court revived a    criminal conviction for defrauding a state company. But he has continued to campaign, with his supporters saying the charges against him are politically motivated. It turns out that being attacked with green substances is something of an occupational hazard for outspoken opponents of Mr. Putin. Late last month, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, another Putin critic, was spattered with green paint at a march in memory of the politician Boris Nemtsov, who was shot and killed on a Moscow bridge two years ago. After the Siberia incident, some Navalny supporters showed solidarity by painting their faces green and posting on Twitter (“Alexey, Kazan headquarters is with you! We support! ”) and one prominent blogger was detained after being seen on Red Square with his face and hands painted green. Undeterred after the latest incident, Mr. Navalny suggested that his new look would help him stand out at rallies. Perhaps he was thinking of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, who wears pastel outfits and colorful hats to help onlookers spot her in a crowd. “This strange assumption of the Kremlin: to pour brilliant green on me so that I don’t travel around the country and call rallies,” he wrote on Facebook. “It’s way cooler that way. Barnaul and Biysk volunteers (where we are opening two campaign headquarters these days) will get the most stylish selfies ever, and I’ll be the star of any rally. ” He did, however, seem more concerned about his new green teeth. “Lemon won’t help you remove brilliant green,” he wrote. “Formic acid is way better. But I’ll remain   for quite some time. What worries me is my teeth. They are also green so far, but I hope they’ll discolor. ” Whatever his new appearance, he showed little sign of backing down. “Our plans don’t change,” he wrote on Facebook. “On 26th, turn out for rallies. ”",0
22377,"Meter Reader Knocks On Man’s Door, Reveals Sinister Plan Once He’s Inside","Share This 
When a man heard a knock on his door in Chicago, Illinois, he discovered a meter reader had arrived. However, the homeowner would instantly regret his decision to let the man inside his home once he revealed his sinister plan that will undoubtedly leave your stomach churning. 
Willie Bell was devastated when his girlfriend chose another man over him. Fueled by rage, Bell devised a sinister plan to pose as a meter reader and enter his romantic rival’s home and do the one thing he thought would return his girl to him – he killed the “other man.” 
The homeowner, Timothy Lawrence, had unknowingly stolen Bell’s girlfriend, but he’d soon find out while he was merely minding his own business and a knock was heard on his door. When he saw a meter reader who claimed he had come to collect some data, Lawrence welcomed him into his home. However, as soon as the door shut, Bell revealed his true identity, and in a jealous fit of rage, he shot Lawrence in the head. Willie Bell at Timothy Lawrence’s home, Bell’s mugshot (inset) 
Surveillance video shows Bell dressed in a reflective workman’s vest and helmet, “working” around Lawrence’s home. Since the two men had never met, Lawrence had no idea who Bell really was until he welcomed him into his home. An hour after he entered Lawrence’s house, Bell was seen on the same surveillance video leaving the home wearing “a T-shirt that read ‘I’m that dude,’” according to Pix 11. 
After Bell stole the victim’s 2004 Buick LeSabre, he went to a local gas station to purchase gasoline and picked up an unidentified accomplice to come back to the home with him some time later. Once they arrived, they entered the home, poured the gasoline, and lit it on fire. Before firefighters could arrive, the house exploded. Lawrence’s body was later recovered from the charred wreckage. 
Luckily, the surveillance footage, which miraculously wasn’t destroyed in the fire, was also recovered, and police were able to identify and apprehend Bell. He was denied bail during a hearing at Cook County court, and he’s facing charges of first-degree murder and concealment of a homicide. “The actions of the defendant were cold, calculating, and pre-planned,” Judge James Brown said during the hearing, according to the Chicago Tribune . “The only reasonable order would be an order of no bail.” 
Whenever anyone is at your door, it’s important to confirm who they are before letting them inside, regardless of who they claim to be. When all is said and done, it’s better to be safe than sorry, and your life could very well depend on it.",0
22382,TOO MANY MILLENNIALS ARE COOL WITH COMMUNISM,"Home › SOCIETY | US NEWS › TOO MANY MILLENNIALS ARE COOL WITH COMMUNISM TOO MANY MILLENNIALS ARE COOL WITH COMMUNISM 0 SHARES [10/27/16] “We learn from history that we do not learn from history,” observed German philosopher Georg Hegel. Perhaps nothing illustrates this better than a new survey showing that far too many “millennials” are not just cool to “capitalism,” but are actually cool with communism. As MarketWatch reports : 
Of the 2,300 Americans polled by YouGov , 80% of baby boomers and 91% of the elderly agree with the statement that “communism was and still is a problem” in the world today. Millennials? Only 55%. 
Furthermore, almost half of Americans between the ages of 16 and 20 said they would vote for a socialist, while 21% would go so far as to back a communist. 
Capitalism, on the other hand, is viewed favorably by 64% of those over the age of 65, compared with only 42% of millennials. 
Citing these results, the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation’s Marion Smith stated, as quoted by MarketWatch , “One of the concerns [the foundation] has had since its establishment is that an emerging generation of Americans has little understanding of the collectivist system and its dark history.” For sure. This was evidenced when a teenager once naively asked me, “What’s so bad about communism?” Another registered a look of shock when I gave him part of the answer: During the 20th century, Marxist governments exterminated approximately 100 million people, making them history’s most murderous ideologues. 
Related to this, MarketWatch also tells us that “a third of millennials say they believe more people were killed under George W. Bush than Joseph Stalin,” clearly oblivious to Stalin’s psychopathic actions having accounted for upwards of 20 million of the above number. Of course, 82 percent of millennials at least knew who Stalin was. This cannot be said regarding Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung; 42 percent of millennials were unfamiliar with this mass murderer of approximately 60 million. Forty percent didn’t know who Argentine Marxist and major Cuban Revolution figure Che Guevara was. With respect to Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, the “unacquainted with” figures were, respectively, 33 and 32 percent. 
Not surprisingly, this ignorance goes beyond history. While it’s troubling that almost half of those aged 16 to 20 would support a socialist, there’s good and bad news here. And they’re the same thing: 
These young people generally don’t know what socialism is. 
As I wrote in February, “People 18 to 29 just helped vault Senator Bernie Sanders to a resounding New Hampshire primary victory, not at all deterred by his socialist label. But while they view that positively, they don’t believe in socialist (in Sanders’) wealth redistribution. In fact, this research shows that they cotton to it little more than do average Americans and no more than their age group did 20 years ago. In other words, millennials may like the word socialism, but, as with so many others, they don’t understand well what it signifies or the nature of those for whom they vote.” 
In reality, the label “socialism” is applied loosely today, yet it has a firm definition. Note that socialism was popularized via Karl Marx’s and Friedrich Engels’ Communist Manifesto . And under Marxist doctrine, “socialism” — or the socialist revolution — is the transitional phase that extinguishes economic freedom and ushers in communism. Moreover, there are no communist governments because “communism” is the culmination of socialism, the stage where, the fanciful theory goes, the government has melted away and everyone lives happily and harmoniously in a state of economic equality-induced bliss.

22384,FBI Director Comey Addresses Senators on Female Genital Mutilation Case - Breitbart,"FBI Director James Comey highlighted his agency’s   female genital mutilation arrests in his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. [“This is among the most important work we do, protecting children especially,” Comey said in his prepared remarks.  Comey described the shocking case of Doctors Jumana Nagarwala and Fakhruddin Attar, which made headlines around the world last month as the very first prosecution for FGM in the United States: For the first time since Congress passed a statute making it a crime in the United States to engage in female genital mutilation, to mutilate little girls  —   it’s been a felony in the United States since 1996  —   we made the first case, last week, against two doctors in Michigan for doing this terrifying thing to young girls all across the country. FGM, a practice most popular among certain parts of the Muslim world, had not been   before recently in the United States. The practice involves cutting a   girl’s genitals in a ritual designed to make her “clean” before her eventual marriage. There are differing forms of mutilation, some more extreme than others, but all involve the removal of varying amounts of a young girl’s clitoris, labia majoria, and labia minora. The most extreme form of FGM is called “infibulation,” in which virtually all external genitalia is removed and the wound is sewn together, leaving only a single tiny hole from which to urinate and menstruate until the girl is married. It is unclear how prevalent FGM is in the United States, but Comey’s FBI believes Nagarwala and Attar’s FGM operation has been operating for over a decade and has mutilated girls from across the American Midwest. Both the doctors and their named victims are part of the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim sect, named only as a “particular religious and cultural community” in the complaints. Dawoodi Bohra is based in India and boasts over a million members across the world, with increasing numbers in the United States. The sect’s leadership has made clear time and again that FGM is absolutely necessary as an “act of religious purity” and “a religious obligation for all women and girls. ” Director Comey closed his remarks by praising his agents who made these arrests possible. “It was done by great work that you don’t hear about a whole lot all across the country by the FBI,” he told the committee.",0
22389,The Email Controversy Sparking Protests in South Korea,"The Email Controversy Sparking Protests in South Korea October 31, 2016 The Email Controversy Sparking Protests in South Korea 
Thousands of South Koreans rallied in Seoul demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye, as a crisis deepened over allegations a friend exerted inappropriate influence over her and interfered in state affairs. The street protest came as prosecutors investigate presidential aides and other officials to determine whether they broke the law to allow Park's friend, Choi Soon-sil, to wield undue influence and gain financially. Angry Koreans say Park betrayed public trust and mismanaged the government, and has lost a mandate to lead the country. ""She must step down,"" Lee Jae-myung, mayor of Seongnam city south of Seoul and a vocal critic of the government, said to a loud cheer from the crowd. ""If Park Geun-hye is no longer president, will our lives be any worse off and will the tension with North Korea be any worse?"" he asked the crowd, which responded ""No!"" About 8,000 people attended the rally, according to police, organized by a group of left-leaning civic groups. Organizers said up to 30,000 people took part in the march through the capital. ""It's become clear the people made a wrong decision and picked a wrong president,"" Jeong Hong-woo, 22, told Reuters at the rally. 
(Seoul) - Police in riot gear faced some protesters as they tried to march on the presidential Blue House. 
Park is in the fourth year of a 5-year one-term presidency. Opposition parties have demanded a thorough investigation, but have not raised the possibility of impeaching her. 
Park's office said late on Friday she ordered her senior secretaries to tender their resignations, and she will reshuffle the office in the near future. Her chief of staff separately offered to resign earlier, the office said. 
The deepening crisis over Choi has sent Park's public support to an all-time low. In one opinion poll, more than 40 percent of respondents said Park should resign or be impeached. 
COOPERATING WITH PROBE 
Prosecutors are investigating two of Park's aides who allegedly helped Choi get access to drafts of Park's speeches and set up two foundations with about 50 billion won ($44 million) in contributions from conglomerates that she later benefited from, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. 
The presidential office said it was cooperating with the prosecutors' investigation, including a request for documents.

A public apology by Park on Tuesday - for giving Choi access to draft speeches during the early months of her presidency - has done little to deflect demands that the president reveal the full extent of her ties with Choi and whether Choi gained favors from the relationship. 
Choi said in a newspaper interview on Thursday from Germany, where she was staying, that she read and revised Park's speeches early in the presidential term, but denied all allegations she interfered in state affairs. 
Park is the latest South Korean leader to be embroiled in scandal involving family or friends. 
As well as demanding Park stand down, civic groups and students want criminal charges brought against her aides and others who helped Choi have access to government documents.

22390,Fox News fires Bob Beckel for second time after alleged racist remark,"Fox News host Bob Beckel was fired Friday over an “insensitive” remark he made to an   employee  —   the second time the former Democratic strategist has been let go from the conservative network. [“Bob Beckel was terminated today for making an insensitive remark to an   employee,” Fox said in a statement Friday.  Beckel, an outspoken liberal who had served as Walter Mondale’s 1984 presidential campaign manager, was frequently in hot water during his time at Fox, particularly for his occasional   cursing and controversial remarks. Beckel was a   of The Five, as well as an occasional guest on other Fox programs. It is the second time Beckel has been fired from the company after he was fired in June 2015 over his “personal issues. ” Beckel had previously spent time in rehab for an addiction to prescription pain medication. “We tried to work with Bob for months, but we couldn’t hold The Five hostage to one man’s personal issues,” Bill Shine,   vice president of programming, said in a statement at the time. “He took tremendous advantage of our generosity, empathy and goodwill and we simply came to the end of the road with him. ” Beckel later contested Shine’s claim that he was taking advantage, tweeting that he had been recovering from back surgery. I just can’t understand the anger in Fox statement. I was healing from major back surgery i could not walk, I took no advantage I got well,  —   Robert G Beckel (@RobertGBeckel) June 26, 2015,  Beckel was rehired in January this year but, according to Variety, Fox’s human resource department was made aware of the alleged remark Tuesday. After an internal investigation, Beckel was fired Friday. Fox’s internal culture has been under the spotlight in recent months, amid a catalog of claims of both racial and sexual harassment at the company. Both Former CEO Roger Ailes, who died Thursday, and former host Bill O’Reilly were fired after sexual harassment claims against them were made public. Both men have denied the allegations.

So-called Islamic State (IS) shot dead 40 civilians on Tuesday in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul after accusing them of treason, the United Nations says. Their bodies were then hung from electricity poles in several districts, the office of the UN Human Rights Commissioner said, citing sources. A man was also reportedly shot dead in public in central Mosul for ignoring an IS ban on using mobile phones. Iraqi security forces are continuing their push to take Mosul back from IS. The killings of the civilians appeared to have been carried out on the orders of self-appointed “courts”, according to the UN report.

22396,"Obama-Appointed, Schumer-Allied Judge Blocks Trump on Deportations - Breitbart","  Federal Judge Ann Donnelly has blocked deportations of foreign nationals who have been detained at American airports in the last day. [The legal maneuver follows an executive order issued by President Trump Friday calling for temporary visa restrictions on seven countries connected to radical Islamic terrorism.  The suit had been filed by the ACLU on behalf of two Iraqi refugees who were detained at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport, despite that both men were later released. NBC reports that a Trump administration official said waivers would be granted for the two men. That didn’t stop Judge Donnelly from granting the stay for others  —   blocking anyone with a valid visa from being detained and keeping those stranded at airports from being deported. It does not mean they have to be released from detention. NBC also reported that the ACLU attorneys and a crowd outside the Federal Court in Brooklyn were elated by the ruling: “Stay is granted,” ACLU Voting Rights Project Director Dale Ho said on Twitter. “Stay is national. ” Crowds outside federal court in Brooklyn cheered the news. The ACLU said the judge ordered a list of detainees to be provided, and said it would go through the names and ensure they are released. “But the critical point tonight is no one can be sent back to one of these countries,” attorney Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, said. Judge Donnelly was appointed by President Obama on the recommendation of current Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer ( .) who said about Donnely at the time, according to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle: “Ann Donnelly met all of my qualifications with flying colors,” Schumer continued. “When you speak with Judge Donnelly, what’s immediately clear is her deep respect and passion for the law. Judge Donnelly is more than a brilliant resume, I know her well and at her core she is a kind, thoughtful and compassionate person. ” There was no comment from the White House at press time.

22402,"Second Mexican Journalist Murdered in One Week, Juarez Cartel Implicated","A Mexican cartel appears to be behind the murder of a respected journalist in the border state of Chihuahua. At the crime scene, cartel members left a note stating that the murder was due to her reporting. [On Thursday morning, unknown gunmen shot Miroslava Breach, a career journalist who worked as an editor for El Norte and most recently for La Jornada. According to La Jornada, Breach was leaving her home at approximately 7:15 a. m. on Thursday morning in the city of Chihuahua when she was fatally shot. At the crime scene, the gunmen left behind a poster board that read “por lenguona. Sigue tu Gobernador. El 80”. The message in the sign claims that the reporter was murdered for saying too much and that the state governor was next.   The message was signed by “El 80” pointing to Carlos Arturo Quintana, a top leader within the Juarez Cartel (Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Cartel). As Breitbart Texas reported this week, Quintana’s gunmen are responsible for a fierce gun battle that killed at least 8 victims and spread terror and despair through the rural communities near Chihuahua. Quintana is wanted by the FBI as part of an ongoing federal case against him on multiple drug trafficking charges tied to the cartel.  Breach’s murder comes just days after Breitbart Texas reported that gunmen murdered Ricardo Monlui Cabrera, a journalist from Veracruz who was murdered as he walked with his wife.  As information about Breach’s murder began to be released, the Network of Journalists of Mexico’s Northeast (RPNM) expressed outrage for the apparent lack response by the Mexican government.  “We demand an expedited response to punish those responsible in a material and in an intellectual fashion for these attacks on the freedom of expression,” the statement noted.  According to the RPNM, Breach’s most recent work was tied to the raging cartel violence in Chihuahua.   politicians may have played a role in the murder, the journalist’s network revealed in their statement. The actions may have been tied to officeholders and their organized crime masters who are losing power under a new state government administration.

22403,Wildlife To Be Renamed Wilddeath,"0 Add Comment 
WITH the number of animals in the wild plummeting by 58% between the years 1970 and 2012, the decision has been made to stop referring to animals as ‘wildlife’ and switch instead to ‘wilddeath’. 
According to the Living Planet report from WWF and the Zoological Society of London, there’s not much point in trying to conserve animal life at this point, as humans have pretty much made it clear that industrialisation, fossil fuels, economic growth and phones that can look up porn at any given minute of any given day are more important than elephants and some sort of beetle that you’ve never heard of. 
From 2017, all remaining animals across the globe will be classed as ‘bonuses’, and we should be living in a humans-only world by 2050. 
“Ah, you’ll always have cats and sheep, domestic animals and livestock, those kind of things,” said Dave Jahon, spokesperson for the World Wilddeath Fund. 
“But lions, gorillas, fuckin’… macaques and what have you, yeah, not much point in trying to save them. We did our best, people just don’t seem to be interested. There’ll be a big crying match when rich people go on safari in Kenya in 2065 and there’s nothing but trees and like, two crows, but it’s not like we didn’t fucking warn them, y’know?” 
Following the change of wildlife to wilddeath, it was also announced that Mankind would be renamed Manpricks.",0

22409,Gatestone Institute: Trump Fires Up Europe’s Anti-Establishment Movement,"The populist,   parties of Europe are taking inspiration from the Presidency of Donald J Trump in the United States, remarks the Gatestone Institute in a new report. [Inspired by the inauguration of U. S. President Donald J. Trump, the leaders of Europe’s main   parties have held a   rally aimed at coordinating a political strategy to mobilize potentially millions of disillusioned voters in upcoming elections in Germany, the Netherlands and France.  Appearing together in public for the first time, Marine Le Pen, leader of the French National Front, Frauke Petry, leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy’s Northern League and Harald Vilimsky of Austria’s Freedom Party gathered on January 21 at a rally in Koblenz, Germany, where they called on European voters to participate in a “patriotic spring” to topple the European Union, reassert national sovereignty and secure national borders. The   rally was held under the banner of the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) a group established in June 2015 by Members of the European Parliament from nine counties to oppose European federalism and the transfer of political power from voters to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union. Referring to the June 2016 decision by British voters to leave the European Union, and the rise of President Donald Trump in the United States, Le Pen said: “We are living through the end of one world, and the birth of another. We are experiencing the return of  . 2016 was the year the   world woke up. 2017, I am sure, will be the year in which the peoples of the European continent rise up. ” Wilders added: “The world is changing. America is changing. Europe is changing. It started last year with Brexit, yesterday there was Trump and today the   parties gathered in Koblenz are making a stand. The genie will not go back into the bottle again, whether you like it or not. The people of the West are awakening. They are throwing off the yoke of political correctness. ” Polls indicate that the political sea change engulfing the United States is fueling support for   parties in Europe. In addition to anger over eroding sovereignty, a growing number of Europeans are rebelling against decades of   multiculturalism, politically correct speech codes and mass migration from the Muslim world.   …    Read more at the Gatestone Institute",0

A man attacked an armed guard in front of the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and was shot to death in the street. No one from the embassy was injured in the attack, but the officer sustained injuries to the head and hand, officials said. 
“There has been a shooting outside the embassy and a man is dead,” a senior police officer told Capital News, and said he would provide more information later. 
The man tried to stab a General Service Unit (GSU) officer who was guarding the entrance of the VISA section on UN Avenue in Gigiri. The GSU is a paramilitary wing of the National Police Service of Kenya. 
“The man was shot after stabbing a GSU officer in the hand and left him with injuries,” Gigiri Divisional Police chief Vitalis Otieno told Capital News. “The officer sustained injuries in the head and hand after the confrontation in which the attacker had tried to grab a gun from him.” 
Heavily armed officers immediately sealed off the road around the scene, and the investigation has already begun, Capital News reported.

Among the biggest changes? The letter “s.” The previous site was known as “Mormons and Gays” — as if those two groups were separate or even opponents. The one that launched Tuesday is “Mormon and Gay,” signaling the notion that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can be — and are — both.

Dutch Nationalist Geert Wilders has announced he refuses to attend his free speech trial because he believes it is politically motivated. Wilders: ""Next Monday, the trial against freedom of speech begins. Against a politician who says what the politically correct elite does not want to hear.” ""This trial is a political trial, in which I refuse to cooperate."" Wilders is accused of discrimination and inciting racism after a famous TV appearance in 2014. Wilders faces a fine of up to 7,400 euros ($8,100) and a year in jail for the remarks. Wilders: ""It is a travesty that I have to stand trial because I spoke about fewer Moroccans. It is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country.” Dutch elections are set for March 15, 2017. Opinion polls: Wilders' Freedom Party is neck-and-neck with the VVD Party of conservative Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. In 2011: Wilders was acquitted of inciting racial hatred for calling for the Koran to be banned and for the deportation of ""criminal"" Moroccans. Judges at time: His remarks, while offensive to some, were within the bounds of legitimate political discourse. Legal experts: Prosecutors have a stronger case this time because Wilders targeted a specific social group, rather than a religion. 
(AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS) Geert Wilders, the Dutch anti-Islam opposition leader, said on Friday that he refuses to attend his trial next week and that he sees it as politically motivated. 
Wilders is accused of discrimination and inciting racism in remarks made on live television in 2014 when he led a roomful of people chanting that they wanted fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands. 
Dutch politicians are limbering up to campaign for elections on March 15, with opinion polls indicating that Wilders' Freedom Party is now neck-and-neck with the VVD Party of conservative Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

22418,Merkel to Regulate Real Estate Loans,"Merkel to Regulate Real Estate Loans by IWB · October 27, 2016 
by Martin Armstrong 
Merkel wants to regulate real estate loans in Germany. The Federal Government is planning to implement extensive regulations on real estate loans. Among other things, debtors will be required under certain circumstances to repay their loans within a given period. The Federal Government said on Monday that the draft law should be followed by recommendations from the German Committee on Financial Stability. 
While there is no real estate bubble right now, it appears they are concerned about further capital inflows, perhaps caused by the failed euro. The new hurdles to be imposed for new loans may have the negative impact of making sales of property in Germany far more difficult as a whole. Such schemes have tended to have a negative impact upon price.",0
22419,Project Veritas Exposes DNC: Rigging the Election Pt. 4 - How PVA Infiltrated Americans United for Change,"Project Veritas Exposes DNC: Rigging the Election Pt. 3 - Killary Wanted ""Ducks on the Ground"" Project Veritas Action has released the fourth video in a multi-part series that is sending shockwaves through the DNC and the Clinton campaign. The first video explained the dark secrets and the hidden connections and organizations the Clinton campaign uses to incite violence at Trump rallies. The second video exposed a diabolical step-by-step voter fraud strategy discussed by top Democratic operatives and showed one key operative admitting that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years. The third video exposed prohibited communications between Hillary Clinton's campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change. This latest video breaks down the process of the long-term investigation. In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer's effort . Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. ""First thing, like I said, thank you for the proposal. And I'd like to get the $20,000 across to you. The second call I'm going to make here is to my money guy and he's going to get in touch with you and auto wire the funds to you,"" said the PVA journalist. Creamer told the PVA journalist to send the money to Americans United for Change. Shortly after the money was released, the ""donors"" ""niece"" - another Project Veritas Action journalist - was offered an internship with Creamer. In an effort to see how far Creamer would go with the promise of more money, another Project Veritas journalist posing as the donor's money liaison requested a meeting with Creamer. During that meeting, Creamer spoke about connections he had with Obama and Clinton. After the release of the previous Project Veritas Action videos, Hillary Clinton and her staff tried to distance themselves from Robert Creamer. However, Creamer doubled down about connection with the campaign. ""Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters,"" said Creamer. The more money that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get. Project Veritas Action's $20,000 investment paid off. The story was solid. Robert Creamer, Scott Foval, Jenna Price from the DNC, Brad Woodhouse from AUFC, Cesar Vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous PVA videos. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC's activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn't been a problem for the month that they had the money. After the former stories were released by Project Veritas Action, Americans United for Change fired Scott Foval and Robert Creamer announced to the DNC that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. James O'Keefe and Project Veritas Action have filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission. Project Veritas Action Fund (AKA Project Veritas Action) was founded by James O'Keefe to investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct.",0
22423,PHOTOS: Mexican Cartel Executes Man in Broad Daylight near Texas Border,"REYNOSA, Tamaulipas  —   Gunmen from a Mexican drug cartel dragged an unknown man out of a tire shop, shot him in the street, and then threw his body in the bed of a pickup before fleeing the area. The attack took place in broad daylight. [A series of leaked photographs obtained by Breitbart Texas captured the moment when a team of Gulf Cartel gunmen pulled up to a tire shop in the Juarez neighborhood. They were carrying assault rifles and handguns during the attack.   The team dragged out an unidentified man toward the truck and in the middle of the street where a man wearing a white shirt used a machine gun to shoot the victim in the head and body. Another photograph revealed the moment when the gunmen throw the body in the bed of the pickup before fleeing.  The brazen execution is the most recent chapter in the ongoing fight for control of this border city between two rival factions of the Gulf Cartel. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting for more than a month, rival factions are waging a bloody war that resulted in at least 36 deaths, including a police officer and an innocent bystander.  The ongoing fighting has resulted in an increase in petty crime as cartel members hold up businesses and perform highway robberies targeting tourists returning from Texas. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

Hillary Clinton has NO PLAN to help minorities. 
Nothing, nada, zilch. 
But she does like rap music, loves hot sauce, and Mexican food is her favorite…. 
So, yeah, VOTE FOR HER. 
Meanwhile, Trump is talking about the issues that matter to the American people. Jobs, security, the economy. Trump represents a new direction for America, where the needs of Americans are placed above foreign interests and are greedy donors and lobbyists. Hillary represents the same thing we’ve got now – a stagnant economy, global politics, and dangerous progressive ideologies. Trump is the candidate of CHANGE. Our dishonest North Korea-style government-run propaganda media whose sole purpose is to spew pro-Hillary rhetoric, anti-Trump lies, and cover up for the most unliked candidate in the history of American elections, says the election is OVER. Hillary has won it. So, why is Hillary on black radio shows saying rappers have “INFLUENCED HER” (hahaha) and going on Hispanic radio, telling everyone that Mexican food is her favorite? Sounds pretty DESPERATE To me. It’s INSULTING too. To think that minorities are so dumb that they’ll vote for someone because they like a certain type of music or food. This is typical “Clinton old school politics.” Treating minorities like dullards by pandering to them around “voting time” and then ignoring them the rest of the time.

22429,"Since Trump, ICE Arrests of Non-Felon Illegal Aliens Doubled - Breitbart","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is no longer “shielding”   aliens who are present in the US illegally, and arrests among that group have doubled since President Trump took office, according to a Washington Post report:[“[Illegal Alien] arrests rose 32. 6 percent in the first weeks of the Trump administration, with newly empowered federal agents intensifying their pursuit of not just [aliens] with criminal records, but also thousands of illegal [aliens] who have been otherwise  . ”  “[ICE] arrested 21, 362 [illegal aliens] mostly convicted criminals, from January through   compared to 16, 104 during the same period last year,” according to statistics obtained by the Post. In what may be the first clear sign that President Trump means to break with the policies of his predecessor, ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea, said in a statement “anyone in the United States illegally could be deported. ” Elzea’s statement went on to say that while ICE “focuses its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security  …    [Homeland Security] Secretary [John] Kelly has made clear, ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. ” There were 5, 441 arrests of   aliens, more than double the total from last year, according to Fox News’ Adam Housley, who reported Monday that “ICE detainers —  requests to local authorities to hold criminal aliens —  are up 75 percent, to more than 22, 000. ” On NBC’s “Meet the Press” this past Sunday, Kelly made it clear that the definition of “criminal” has not changed, “but where on the spectrum of criminality we operate has changed. ” In Housely’s report, Kelly said ICE agents may move to deport an individual with multiple DUI offenses —  even though in the past, those individuals would have been “unlikely” to be deported. “The law deports people. Secretary Kelly doesn’t. ICE doesn’t. It’s the United States criminal justice system that deports people,” Kelly said. Even though Trump’s arrest and deportation statistics haven’t surpassed Obama’s according to The Week, “It’s the tactics Trump’s ICE agents use  —   arresting [illegal] immigrants in state and local courthouses and on the way to work, as well as apparently targeting immigrant advocates who speak out  —   that has struck terror into [illegal] immigrant communities. ” The threat of enforcement has reportedly resulted in fewer crimes being reported in some communities heavily populated by illegal aliens.  Whether or not that’s because the threat of enforcement has led potential criminals to lay low —  or potential victims from reporting crime —  remains to be seen. It’s worthy to note that almost every media source that covered this story made reference to how the “vast majority” of the 11 million illegal aliens in the US who are not felons, are “otherwise  . ”  There are two problems with that narrative.  First, the 11 million number has been quoted by media sources since 2005 —  even though a source is never quoted. The number could be substantially more.   author Ann Coulter suggest the number of illegal aliens in the United States could be as high as 30 million. Secondly, there are countless examples of ordinary illegal aliens, whose first crime resulted in the tragic murder of a person who would otherwise be alive —  had the law been enforced and unlawful aliens removed.

AS THE wave of euphoria and protests which greeted his election victory have died down, Donald Trump gave consideration for the first time to what the actual jobs, tasks and responsibilities a president had. 
Crouched out of the view of his family and campaign staff, Trump began searching various Wikipedia entries in a bid to find out just what he is expected to do come his inauguration January 20th. 
Reading that his inauguration was pencilled in for the end of January, the president-elect then began googling once more in an effort to pin down what exactly an inauguration is. 
“Shit,” Trump muttered under his breath after realising the job extended beyond repeating the phrase Make America Great Again for 4 years straight. Trump was then further frustrated when a search for ‘wet T-shirt competitions – White House law’ returned no results. 
It is believed current US President Barack Obama met with Trump yesterday to discuss the transition of power between the two, in a meeting that should have lasted 10 minutes.

One has to wonder how man degrees away this network is from those that appear to be involved in staging tragedies (such as shootings and terrorist events) for media exploit. Can we believe anything that we see on the national stage? The defeat of Hillary hits a nerve deep into the shadow network that runs the Deep State, because the message of rejection of the establishment speaks to deep-set resentment and anger among the population. To make an educated guess, with the world swinging towards Trump as an attempt to dump the globalist oligarchy, the powers that be will see the need for some big events to occur in response – in other words, they need a new crisis. If they were planning a false flag event of some kind, what would stop them from going all the way?

A former FBI official described the Clintons as a ‘crime family’ days after the bureau reopened its investigation into Hillary’s personal email server. 
James Kallstrom, the former assistant director of the FBI, spoke out against the Clinton family on Sunday in a radio interview with host and Greek-American billionaire businessman John Catsimatidis on ‘The Cats Roundtable’. 
‘The Clintons, that’s a crime family. It’s like organized crime, basically. The Clinton Foundation is a cesspool,’ Kallstrom said. 
‘It’s just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money 
‘And she’s a pathological liar, and she’s always been a liar. And God forbid if we put someone like that in the White House.’ 
Kallstrom, who is best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late 1990s, also went after the FBI in the interview and said the initial investigation into the email server was ‘never a real investigation.’ 
‘They never had grand jury empaneled. And the reason … was that Loretta Lynch would not go along with that,’ Kallstrom said. 
‘So this investigation was without the ability to serve subpoenas, serve search warrants, and obtain the evidence that they ended up begging for. It was just ludicrous what went on.’ 
He added that the FBI ‘left so much stuff on the table’. 
Kallstrom did defend the agents who were tasked with investigating Clinton. 
‘This is not the FBI agents who’s to blame for this fiasco going on. This is the leadership. This is Jim Comey … The agents are furious with what’s going on. I know that for a fact,’ he said.

The recent case involving a first-generation Latina student , Tiffany Martínez, at Suffolk University, is but one example. An accomplished undergraduate, published journal author and McNair scholar, Martínez wrote a personal blog post titled “Academia, Love Me Back.” In her heartfelt plea, Martínez first recounts an experience she described as both disrespectful and invalidating and then explains that a sociology professor accused her of plagiarism, not privately, but in front of the entire class. The professor’s claim was further illustrated by emphatic written statements on her paper such as “this is not your word” and “please go back and indicate where you cut and paste.” 
One such comment was written in the margin near the word “hence,” which the professor had circled, an important detail, given Martínez merely used it as an appropriate transition to connect two related sentences. Was it that surprising to Martínez’s professor that she knew how to appropriately use a transitional word? 
Although some may dismiss this as a minor incident, Martínez reminds us of the internalized racism and self-doubt resulting from years of educational violence. Like the many students of color from whom we hear similar stories in our campus climate assessments , what transpired for Martínez was yet another debilitating and painful experience of marginalization.

LONDON – England – The real referendum will be the next general election when the people who voted for Brexit (52% of the electorate) will make their voices heard once again. 

The multiple scenarios and variables are too many to discuss in one article, however it is fair to say that any MP who is a Remainer will not be in office after the election. 
With this in mind, the currently unelected PM, Theresa May, will most certainly lose her position chiefly because of her dilly dallying regarding the Brexit process and her choice in putting key Remain MPs in high government positions and Brexit committees which undermined everything. 
Because of the unjust corrupt court ruling today conducted by biased judges , there are calls for a general election to be held before 2020. 
If this happens, there will be a bloodbath at the polling booths however under the current circumstances, if a general election occurs in 2020, there will still be a bloodbath. 
It does not matter when the next election is held, there will be a bloodbath of Remain MPs. Your days of parliament are numbered, so count them well. 
It is probably in Theresa May’s interest to never hold a general election in Britain ever again. Certainly, this choice will suit the undemocratic Remain contingent, such is their allegiance to the undemocratic EU. Share on :",0
22450,The U.S. Government Pollinates “Fake News”,"Financial Markets , Gold , Housing Market , Market Manipulation , Precious Metals , U.S. Economy fake news , housing collapse , stock bubble admin 
The widespread, systematic implementation of propaganda dates back to at least the World War 1 era when Edward Bernays – the nephew of Sigmund Freud and the Father of Propaganda – began working with Woodrow Wilson. The dissemination and proliferation of “fake news” for the purpose of “thought control” is a form a fascism that is seeded in the Totalitarian creep that is engulfing the U.S. political system. 
The commentary published by John Whitehead of the The Rutherford Institute is a must-read in order to put the “fake news” problem into its proper context. 
[T]the “news” we receive is routinely manufactured, manipulated and made-to-order by government agents. Not when six corporations control 90% of the media in America. And not when, as Davies laments, “news organizations which might otherwise have exposed the truth were themselves part of the abuse, and so they kept silent, indulging in a comic parody of misreporting, hiding the emerging scandal from their readers like a Victorian nanny covering the children’s eyes from an accident in the street.” The Pentagon has now designated “information operations” as its fifth “core competency” alongside land, sea, air and special forces. Since October 2006, every brigade, division and corps in the US military has had its own “psyop” element producing output for local media. This military activity is linked to the State Department’s campaign of “public diplomacy” which includes funding radio stations and news websites. 
You can read the rest of this here: When It Comes To Fake News, The Government Is The Biggest Culprit 
The manipulation of economic data and the markets is yet another insidious form of propaganda and implementation of political/economic control. I’ve detailed ad nauseum evidence of the fraudulent economic data across a wide range of Government reports – employment, GDP, housing, inflation, etc. 
This is going to get worse regardless of who or which party occupies the White House. It’s about control and power. Ultimately the Government has no control over the laws of economics. When the majority of the population feels the pain of economic distress in spite of the misleadingly optimistic economic reports, the Government has no choice but to implement control policies in order to maintain its power. 
There is nothing we can do about this but you can prepare accordingly if you at least recognize the truth. If you want to see who this plays out, I would suggest re-reading “1984” and “Atlas Shrugged.” Share this:",0

22452,Trump Names Dr. David Shulkin to Lead Veterans Affairs ’He’s Fantastic’ - Breitbart,"  Donald J. Trump named Dr. David J. Shulkin as his nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs at his Wednesday press conference at Manhattan’s Trump Tower. [“He’s fantastic. He’s fantastic. He will do a truly great job,” said Trump, who called the press conference to discuss his plan to transfer control of his business operations to his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr. and a   Trump Organization executive. “You’ll be very impressed with the job he does. ”  The incoming president said he interviewed more than 100 candidates for the VA job, “some good and some not so good. ” Trump said improving the VA was one of the key commitments he made in the 2016 campaign. “Veterans have been treated horribly,” he said. “They wait for 15, 16, 17 days —  cases when they go in with a minor, easy form of cancer and they can’t see a doctor,” he said. “By the time they see a doctor, they’re terminal,” he said. If Shulkin takes over the VA, it will be a promotion for the internist with more than 20 published academic papers. Sulkin is one of the few holdovers from President Barack Obama’s administration, where he currently serves as the chief executive of the   strong Veterans Health Administration, the nation’s largest integrated health care system with more than 1, 700 sites of care, serving nine million Veterans each year. The VA also conducts medical research and is the largest employer of medical graduate students in the country. “VA is at a historic crossroad and will need to make bold reforms that will shape how we deliver IT services and health care in the future, as well as improve the experiences of Veterans, community providers, and VA staff,” Shulkin said at his June 22 testimony before Congress. “Throughout this transformation, our number one priority has and will always be the Veteran —  ensuring a safe and secure environment for their  information and improving their experience is our goal. ” In addition to naming Shulkin, Trump again talked about the partnerships he is forming between the VA and the Cleveland Clinic, the Mayo Clinic, and other elite private medical institutions to improve the medical care veterans receive. Shulkin was confirmed by the Senate in June 2015 as the VA’s Undersecretary for Health. Before joining the Obama administration, Shulkin held leadership positions in private medical companies and hospitals and was the founder of DoctorQuality, which developed and sold software allowing medical professionals to identify, track, and analyze medical adverse events and other events relevant to lessons learned and exposure to regulatory reporting.

22453,Nintendo Claims ’No Widespread Technical Problems’ with Switch Despite Complaints - Breitbart,"Contrary to consumer reports, Nintendo claims that Nintendo Switch issues are not widespread and fall in line with past hardware launches. [In a statement sent to Forbes contributor Ollie Barder, Nintendo claims the Switch has “no widespread technical problems” and “all issues are being handled promptly. ” This specifically includes problems with the Bluetooth connection in the left   controller.  Nintendo said that the number of connection issues “is not significant” and that the “total number of repair or replacement requests for Nintendo Switch, including for   is consistent with what we’ve seen for any new hardware Nintendo has launched. ” The company also stressed that it was “common with any new innovative consumer technology for consumers to have questions, and Nintendo Switch is no exception. ” They pointed to their online consumer support site for any questions related to the hardware, and “encourage [customers] to contact Nintendo’s Consumer Service team” with any issues. While it’s good to see Nintendo respond to consumer concerns, so far their statements are pretty par for the corporate course. Despite launch issues on multiple fronts, their focus is on keeping the perception of their brand strong in hopes of continuing the success they’ve had so far with the new console’s launch. The next months of the Switch’s life will be pivotal, and the way Nintendo handles its customers’ problems may very well define the ultimate success or failure of the company’s hybrid console experiment.

22456,"Huma may have violated ‘legal obligation’ regarding classified info, FOIA request shows","Print 
Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told CNN’s Michael Smerconish Saturday that Huma Abedin signed an OF-109 disclosure form when she left the State Department in 2013, signifying she understood the “legal obligation” to “turn over all classified information and to further safeguard any further information that could be disclosed.” 
“Let’s put this in context,” Spicer told Smerconish. “Hillary Clinton initially said she turned over everything that was relevant. The only thing she didn’t were emails regarding yoga and Chelsea’s wedding.” 
“We know that to be false.” 
“Further, when Huma Abedin left the State Department they have to file a form of OF-109,” he continued. “It’s a separation agreement that states simply people understand when leaving government that they are maintaining no classified information, they understand their legal obligation to protect further classified information and safeguard any potential disclosures of that.”",0
22457,United Nations Elects Saudi Arabia to Women’s Rights Commission - Breitbart,"The United Nations Economic and Social Council voted late last week to place Saudi Arabia on the Commission on the Status of Women for a   term beginning in 2018, despite that country’s appalling record on the treatment of women. [Hillel Neuer, director of the   UN Watch, expressed his outrage in a statement Friday:  “Electing Saudi Arabia to protect women’s rights is like making an arsonist into the town fire chief,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch. “It’s absurd. ” “Every Saudi woman,” said Neuer, “must have a male guardian who makes all critical decisions on her behalf, controlling a woman’s life from her birth until death. Saudi Arabia also bans women from driving cars. ” According to UN Watch, the United States forced a formal vote, against China’s wishes, instead of allowing the normal practice of allowing regional groupings to select the nations on the commission by themselves, in secret. However, the vote was still held behind closed doors, meaning it is not yet clear precisely which countries voted to honor one of the world’s foremost abusers of women’s rights. Neuer calculates, based on the voting math, that at least five European Union member states would have had to vote for Saudi Arabia for it to win a seat on the commission. The U. S. State Department’s most recent human rights report on Saudi Arabia (largely prepared by the outgoing Obama administration) notes that despite being allowed to participate in municipal elections in 2015, the state of women’s rights in the kingdom remains generally abysmal: Women continued to face significant discrimination under law and custom, and many remained uninformed about their rights.   …     The law does not provide for the same legal status and rights for women as for men, and since there is no codified   law, judges made decisions regarding family matters based on their interpretations of Islamic law. Although they may legally own property and are entitled to financial support from their guardian, women have fewer political or social rights than men, and society treated them as unequal members in the political and social spheres. The guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her “guardian” with the legal authority to approve her travel outside of the country. A guardian also has authority to approve some types of business licenses and study at a university or college. Women can make their own determinations concerning hospital care. Women can work without their guardian’s permission, but most employers required women to have such permission. A husband who verbally (rather than through a court process) divorces his wife or refuses to sign final divorce papers continues to be her legal guardian. In 2015, Saudi Arabia reduced a Sri Lankan woman’s sentence for adultery from execution by stoning to three years in prison. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

22461,Hillary Clinton is an alcoholic,"The American Medical Association defines an “alcoholic” as someone who: Has a prolonged period of frequent, heavy alcohol use. Is unable to control drinking once it has begun. Has withdrawal symptoms when the individual stops using alcohol. Needs to use more and more alcohol to achieve the same effects. Has a variety of social and/or legal problems arising from alcohol use. 
By that definition, Hillary Clinton is an alcoholic . Exhibit A 
In an email to Hillary’s campaign chairman John Podesta on August 8, 2015, Director of Communications for Hillary’s campaign Jennifer Palmieri wrote, referring to Hillary: 
“I think you should call her and sober her up some.” 
Here’s a screenshot of the email released by WikiLeaks : Exhibit B 
On Feb. 23, 2015, Hillary’s spokesman Nick Merrill sent an email (presumably to Hillary’s campaign staff) with the subject: “HRC Clips” (news clips on Hillary Rodham Clinton). The news clips that day included an article by Benjamin Bell for ABC News titled, “One Thing That Might Surprise You About Hillary Clinton,” which Merrill reproduced in its entirety in his email. 
Bell’s article was an interview with New York Times national political reporter Amy Chozick, on whether Hillary Clinton would announce she’s running for the presidency. One of the questions Bell asked Chozick was: “Covering [Hillary] Clinton, what is one thing that has surprised you about her?” 
Chozick answered: 
“Hmm. She likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008 and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in Pennsylvania. Um, no.” 
Here’s a composite screenshot of the relevant part of Merrill’s email, from WikiLeaks : Exhibit C 
According to the National Enquirer , “top staffers” of Hillary’s campaign told the Enquirer “they even began this year’s presidential campaign by secretly planning a stint in rehab for Hillary.” But any rehab therapy “quickly failed amid the pressures of the campaign” and “the effort of making a deal over an FBI probe into her e-mail scandal”. 
A source said, “The stress of her political career, the never-ending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a life-threatening booze hell. She turned to drink to drown her fears. Hillary tries to hide her problem, like she lies about so many things.” A “close friend” of Hillary added, “ Hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater Bill. She’s also hit the bottle to cope with other stress, as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was Secretary of State.” 
One “Hillary insider” told the Enquirer that Hillary “has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done ” and that “She’s not fit to be President”. 
Certainly, Hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman (see below) because no sane person in her then position as U.S. Secretary of State would behave like this in public.

22463,Silicon Valley’s Ro Khanna: I Will Go to Jail to Resist Trump,"  Rep. Ro Khanna ( ) of Silicon Valley vows that he will go to jail to protest the presidency of Donald Trump as part of the “California Resistance” to the new administration. [In an interview with Randy Shandobil of the “This Golden State” podcast, Khanna, a   American whose parents immigrated from India, referred to Gandhi’s campaign of civil disobedience against British rule in the subcontinent.  “Resistance, for me, is something  —   I think of my grandfather. He spent four years in jail during Gandhi’s independence movement in the 1940s to fight for India’s freedom   …     Donald Trump, as much of a step backwards as that was, has a   term   …     four years in a democracy is a far easier challenge than the one my grandfather had. ” Khanna served in the Obama administration before challenging Rep. Mike Honda ( ) in an unsuccessful bid for the Silicon Valley seat in 2014. He came back again in 2016 and won. Asked what Khanna would do if federal agents came to his district, the 17th district of California, looking for immigrants to deport, Khanna said he would risk arrest. “I think there is a point of civil disobedience. I hope it won’t come to that   …     if it came to a point where I thought there was a deep moral injustice, where they were rounding up folks who are going and living their lives, and have been in this country, and they’re splitting families, and there is moment of moral leadership needed, then I think I would. ” Khanna said that Democrats had managed to “resist” in 2004 when George W. Bush won   and Republicans controlled Congress and proposed privatizing Social Security. The result, he proudly said, was that Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( ) had led Democrats to power in 2006. He praised Silicon Valley CEOs who had stood up for social issues in recent years, even if they had to seek common ground with the Trump administration on economic issues.  Shandobil challenged Khanna, noting that he shared some common stances with Trump, including support for term limits, opposition to the   Partnership, and reform of the   visa system. (Shandobil also asked Khanna to react to some of Trump’s more controversial policies, erroneously claiming Trump wants to “register all Muslims. ”) Khanna said that his agreement with Trump on certain issues was coincidental and had nothing to do with supporting his presidency. “California has to be a laboratory for resistance,” Khanna said, citing the “innovative, progressive policies” of the state. He called Trump an “aberration” who did not have a mandate to change the country’s policies, because he did not win the popular vote. Khanna added that stopping Trump from deporting illegal immigrants would be his top priority. “There was no accommodation with British imperialism,” he said, referring to his grandfather’s activism. “Anything worth fighting for, whether it was the freedom movement in India, or the civil rights movement, it never accommodates with principles that are abhorrent. ” He said that Democrats should not resist everything Trump did just for the sake of resisting, but should oppose specific policies. He claimed that Republicans had done otherwise, opposing Obama even when they agreed with his policies. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

The tweet said: 
“Heavy hearts today. Our beagle of 13 years passed away quietly last night. Rest In Peace, Maverick. We will miss you.”

22466,Trumpâ€™s Proposed Student Loan Program Makes Him Look More Liberal Than Obama; Republicans Fuming,"Share on Facebook 
Republicans in Congress and perhaps across the nation are suffering today from a case of buyers remorse after Trump begins back peddling on several of his campaign promises, before he even takes office. 
Over the last few days, he backed off on his claim that he’ll repeal Obamacare by saying he’d just tweak it. He’s seemed to have changed his mind on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and he’s no longer talking about banning Muslims. While “drain the swamp,” which referred to Washington’s culture of corruption, was one of his later campaign slogans, he’s filling his cabinet posts with Washington insiders and corporate lobbyists. He’s even appearing to change his mind about his signature issue, the wall between the United States and Mexico . 
One piece of Trump’s campaign rhetoric was actually something that would make people’s lives better and it’s something that Republicans are going to hate. His proposal for student loans is radical, in that it’s not a gift to Wall Street and it’s even more liberal than anything President Obama has proposed. In a rally just a month ago, Trump said about student loans: 
“We would cap repayment for an affordable portion of the borrower’s income, 12.5 percent, we’d cap it. That gives you a lot to play with and a lot to do,” Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. “And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we’ll let them get on with their lives. They just go ahead and they get on with their lives.” 
“Students should not be asked to pay more on the debt than they can afford,” Trump said. “And the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.” 
Source: Washington Post 
Trump’s proposed debt forgiveness program is actually pretty similar to Obama’s . Instead of a 12.5 percent cap, Obama introduced a cap of 10 percent of a graduate’s income. Trump’s program, though, would leave graduates with five fewer years of debt. Trump’s would forgive debt after 15 years while Obama’s would forgive after 10. In that one significant way, Trump’s program is even more liberal than Obama’s and if he carries it out, Congressional Republicans may have no choice but to turn on their party’s President. 
The American Enterprise Institute is a Washington think tank who issues a lot of the marching orders of Republicans. They were the driving force behind the Iraq war and of failed trickle down economics. This is what they have to say about student loan debt forgiveness: 
“They are way off on their numbers,” said Jason Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “If you were going to give loan forgiveness in 15 years, you’re going to forgive a lot more debt than you’re going to make up for in the form of the higher payments they’re proposing, by a lot. I don’t even need to run the numbers. It’s so obvious.” 
Really, it’s not obvious. Forgiving student debt would be a big boost to the economy because it would 1.) incentivize people to become more educated and 2.) put more money back into the economy because graduates would be free to buy more. Not that Republicans care about that, though. They prefer that graduates owe their lives to Wall Street banks and in turning his back on that, Trump is violating literally everything his party stands for.",0
22467,North Korea May Provide It’s Own Election Day Bombshell,"North Korea May Provide It’s Own Election Day Bombshell November 07, 2016 North Korea May Provide It's Own Election Day Bombshell 
South Korea’s military is on high alert over concerns that North Korea will launch a missile as U.S. voters head to the polls on election day, reports Yonhap News Agency. Military officials suggest that the North may attempt another launch one of its Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), a potential threat to U.S. forces in Guam. The American strategic assets stationed in Guam could be used to back up U.S. and South Korean troops on the Korean peninsula were the North to attack its southern neighbor. South Korea’s military noted that Pyongyang may want to present a show of force to demonstrate that it will continue its nuclear and ballistic missile programs despite pressure from the U.S. and the international community. 
“Doing a major test would be a way of trying to intimidate the incoming president,” Victor Cha, senior adviser and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, previously told CNN, “North Korea chooses particular windows that they know will gain maximum attention from the world, and the US in particular.” 
North Korea has historically attempted to stir up trouble around U.S. elections, CNN explained, citing a recent CSIS study on North Korea and its provocations. 
“We are closely watching every move by the North Korean military at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site and other possible missile-launching sites. The military is fully prepared to respond to any provocative acts by the North,” an official from South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) revealed to reporters. 
ROK JCS Chairman Gen. Lee Sun-jin told troops to arm themselves with a “fight tonight” spirit. 
READ MORE: NORTH KOREA MOVING FASTER THAN EXPECTED ON MISSIBLE DEVELOPMENT 
U.S. officials have also indicated that the North may attempt another missile launch prior to or during the election. It is unclear, however, whether the North is prepared to carry out such a test. 
North Korea has conducted eight Musudan IRBM tests with only one success. The two most recent tests were failures which damaged some of the Korean People’s Army’s launch equipment. 
“While there has been speculation of a North Korean satellite launch or nuclear test occurring during the run-up to the US Presidential election, the evidence from commercial satellite imagery of the Sohae Satellite Launching Station and the Punggye-ri nuclear test site suggests it’s possible but unlikely,” 38 North, a blog run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at SAIS, argued. 
The U.S.-based think tank did, however, note that there has been some activity around the North Portal at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site and that North Korea could conduct a nuclear test on short notice. 
Pyongyang has not made any public threats, but that does not preclude the possibility of an election day surprise from North Korea.

22468,Smuggler Gets 20 Years for Assaulting Border Patrol Agent,"LAREDO, Texas  —   A U. S. citizen from this border city who was found guilty of assaulting a U. S. Border Patrol agent while smuggling roughly five pounds of crystal meth will spend almost 20 years in prison. [On Monday,    Jorge Rocha went before U. S. District Judge Marina Garcia Marmolejo, who sentenced him to spend 235 months or 19 years and 7 months in prison for assaulting a federal agent and for smuggling the drugs, information provided to Breitbart Texas by the U. S. Attorney’s office revealed. Rocha had been convicted of the charges on July 18, 2016 and had been in federal detention awaiting sentencing.   The case against Rocha began on January 29, 2016 when U. S. Border Patrol agents were called to the downtown area in what used to be at one point the River Mall shopping center, court records obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed. A camera operator has spotted a group of men crossing the Rio Grande and alerted the agents to the general area so they could intercept them. When one of the agents arrived to the area he spotted Rocha running out of the river towards the stairs that lead to the defunct shopping center. While trying to carry out the arrest, Rocha struck the agent in the head multiple times with an unknown object. Eventually the agent received backup and the group was able to arrest Rocha and find a drug package with five pounds of meth that he had been carrying.  As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, the area near downtown Laredo and other nearby areas continue to be a favored crossing point for drug smugglers working for the Los Zetas cartel who now go by the name Cartel Del Noreste. Since downtown Laredo and Nuevo Laredo lack any physical barriers such as fencing to slow down smugglers, Los Zetas only have to cross the shallow waters of the Rio Grande to bring their goods into the Texas city.

22469,"Olympian’s Mother Leaves a Suitcase at Check-In, and It Is Destroyed - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Running late after arriving for the Olympics last week, the mother of the United States volleyball player Carli Lloyd dropped her suitcase at the cruise ship where she is staying during the Games. She and her family then rushed to see her daughter’s first match. When the group returned a few hours later, the mother, Cindy Lloyd, was pulled into an interrogation room and shown the charred and unrecognizable remains of her suitcase. It had been blown up because, the authorities told her, they suspected it was a bomb. “The handle was nowhere,” said Ms. Lloyd, who is traveling with her brother and two grown children. “It was completely blown up. There was some clothing. They use some sort of wet bomb, I think, because everything was wet. Some of the clothes were salvageable, but some were melted. Some had holes. My American flag was melted. And all the toiletries with caps had their caps blown off. ” The authorities in Brazil have blown up several suspicious bags since the Olympics began, including an unattended one near the finish line of a cycling race. But the case of Ms. Lloyd’s suitcase may be the most curious of all. Ms. Lloyd, whose daughter is often confused with the American soccer star with the same name, had reservations to stay on a Norwegian Cruise Line ship, docked in Rio next to the luxury liner housing the United States basketball teams. A series of canceled and missed flights from Southern California led the family to connections in Peru and Chile  —   and all the security checkpoints between  —   on the way to Brazil. Finally in Rio, they took a taxi to the cruise terminal to check in. They gave their names, had their passports checked and handed over their luggage, like everyone else in line. They presumed that their bags would be in their cabin when they returned. When they came back, the others were checked in quickly. Ms. Lloyd was stopped. “They took me back to this room, and there were some really scary people,” she said. “They started interrogating me. I don’t know who they were, but there were five or six of them, all in uniform. And after about 10 minutes, they told me they blew up my bag. ” Ms. Lloyd said that she was told, in accented English, that two   dogs had stopped at her suitcase. She was shown a photo of the contents, presumably from an   machine. Asked to explain what different things were, she pointed to something that looked like the extra cellphone she packed, a phone charger and a bottle of shampoo. “Maybe they thought it was something wired to a bottle, I suppose,” she said. What she could not understand was why the authorities handed her the phone. They had opened the bag and retrieved the phone yet still proceeded to blow up the bag. And she could not figure out how a bag that had gone through several cities on different airlines without any suspicion was suddenly in pieces in front of her. “Looking back at it, it was really bizarre,” Ms. Lloyd said. Norwegian Cruise Line, she said, has been extremely apologetic and helpful. It brought her sparkling wine, provided free meals and told Ms. Lloyd that it would reimburse her for the cost of replacing all the ruined items. The cruise line also said that it would get her a new suitcase for the way home. Ms. Lloyd remained   about the episode. As she spoke, she wore a shirt with holes in it because she had not had time to go shopping. If nothing else, she has an interesting story to tell back home. “But I didn’t want to have a story,” she said. “Watching your daughter at the Olympics was a good enough story for me. ”",0
22471,Hillary To Be Indicted After Election: Trump Responds To FBI Investigation,"Hillary To Be Indicted After Election: Trump Responds To FBI Investigation Clinton scrambles following FBI announcement on new email evidence Infowars.com - October 28, 2016 Comments 
Alex Jones breaks down the FBI’s Friday announcement on the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server as new evidence surfaces. 
The new data was reportedly uncovered during a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner – the husband of Clinton ally Huma Abedin. 
FBI Director James Comey cited “recent developments” for the bureau’s decision in a letter to committees and lawmakers today. 
“In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,” Comey wrote. 
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.”

22472,’Clinton Cash’ Movie Viewed Over 2 Million Times in Opening Week - Breitbart,"Clinton Cash, the groundbreaking documentary film exposing the Clinton Foundation’s global corruption, has been viewed more than 2 million times in the opening week of its global online premiere. [Views of the film on Breitbart News’ YouTube channel and the Philly Blunt pirated YouTube version have exceeded a combined viewer count of more than 2 million views however, that number doesn’t include an accounting of those who’ve watch the recently released director’s cut of the film, attended watch parties, watched the film during its debut over the weekend on One America News Network, or viewed it via myriad other pirated formats.  Initial reaction to Clinton Cash was overwhelming, with more than 170, 000 viewers watching the film within the first three hours of it’s worldwide release. The film, directed by M. A. Taylor and written and produced by Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, was promoted  —   and praised  —   by both sides of the political spectrum. Indeed, for the first three days of the Democratic Party’s   coronation of Hillary Clinton as their presidential nominee, Clinton Cash was sitting atop Facebook’s trending topics list. Much of the viral online explosion of the Clinton Cash documentary was the result of Bernie Sanders supporters, who flocked to their respective Facebook accounts and urged their followers and fans to watch and share the groundbreaking movie. The film is based on the explosive New York Times bestselling book Clinton Cash, authored by Government Accountability Institute President and Breitbart Senior    Peter Schweizer, which first exposed the   speaking fees to Bill Clinton and donations to the Clinton Foundation from foreign contributors, which coincided with favors for those closest to the Clintons and their foundation donors while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State. The paperback version of Clinton Cash was released on Tuesday, July 26. Next month, on August 8, the   Clinton Cash graphic novel will be available for audiences everywhere and is sure to capture the imagination of millennial audiences for generations to come.

22475,Re: Liberals Claim Acquittal of Bundys is “Weaponized White Privilege”,"Email 
The liberal internet sites and some in social media actually believe that the acquittal on all charges brought against the Bundys and five others last week for their peaceful protest and occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon was a sign of white privilege . One outlet, even allowed a black columnist to write that white privilege was now ""weaponized."" 
Consider the moronic claim of Chauncey Devega at Salon , ""Just consider: An all-white jury acquitted militant religious fundamentalists whose avowed aim is hurting the U.S."" 
Excuse me? Hurting the US? How so Mr. Devega? 
Well, according to Mr. Devega, ""Despite the overwhelming evidence against the Bundy militants, on Thursday a federal jury in Portland acquitted them of federal weapons and conspiracy charges. This shocked many observers. It should not have."" 
""Black Americans and other people of color often talk about how there is one legal system for 'them' and another for 'us,'"" he added. 
What is this evidence of which he speaks? Well, he doesn't quite tell us. He never mentions any laws that were broken. It's not against the law to keep and bear arms . It's not against the law to go and occupy an area that is supposed to be under the people's control per the Constitution. Technically, per the Constitution, the land does not belong to the central government. It's not against the law to hold a press conference there. It's not against the law to address your government for grievances. 
In fact, all those things are a part of the law! 
Oh, and what does Mr. Devega have to say about this photo with a black man standing with LaVoy Finicum and Pete Santilli ? 
Does that look like white privilege to you? Did LaVoy Finicum receive white privilege Chauncey? I don't think so. The tyranny you are supporting murdered him in cold blood and now a jury has determined that they were doing nothing wrong that should have warranted their arrest nor his murder. 
How about the months these men sat in jail in Oregon while being denied bail? Was that white privilege? What about the fact they are facing similar trumped up charges in Nevada from something that took place two years ago, and are still sitting in jail? Is that white privilege Chauncey? 
He then went on to ask if Muslims did this would it be terrorism. I can answer that, yes. However, the reason why I can affirm that is because they would have created violence, just as they are taught to do in the Koran as they follow in the footsteps of their founder, Muhammad. They usually do. The only violence at Bundy Ranch or in Oregon was the result of the Oregon State Police , the FBI , and the Bureau of Land Management . Those were the people with guns pointed at citizens, despite Devega's claims otherwise. 
If that was not enough, Devega forgot that a Native American woman, Sheila M. Warren, testified on behalf of… the defense! Was that your white privilege Mr. Devega? 
""As the social-media hashtag #CrimingWhileWhite signals, there is a dual system of justice in the United States of America One exists for white people — especially white conservatives and other members of the right wing — and a separate one for people of color and Muslims,"" added Devega. ""This is white privilege weaponized through the law."" 
Devega is not the only one to put forth this nonsense. 
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof also claimed this acquittal may have been racially motivated. 
Other people on social media chimed in making the same ridiculous claims without ever once citing any law that was broken. Terrorism is legal when ur white https://t.co/ewFsaRpJVJ",0
22477,Mind blowing Response from International Media to demonetization! It will shut the Mouth of Opposition!,"Viswajith | November 16, 2016 | Trending | 4.7k SHARES 
This is how international media responded to india’s currency ban which shows the impact of this historic decision over world economy and how it is going to stop corruption and black money in india! IMF, European Union, World Bank and every reputed international organisations supported this move, World bank president even said, I am a big fan of Modi! 
Forbes: Five days after the decision, Forbes has published an article titled “India’s Great Bank Note Switch Appears To Be Working – $30 Billion In Rs Deposited In Banks.” The article notes that a move of this magnitude would result in “obvious chaos”, but points that “so far at least it looks as if it is working.” The article goes on to call the scheme “rather well done, a clever plan.” 
New York Times: A New York Times quoted an expert saying it was a wise move. “The plan, top secret until Mr. Modi’s announcement, was hailed by financial analysts as bold and potentially transformational for India. It is also a high-stakes experiment,” the article said. 
Washington Post: It called PM Narendra Modi’s initiative as ‘ambitious’ and in keeping with his election time vow to initiate a crackdown against black money. The Post said black money in India ‘is estimated to total from $400 billion to more than $1 trillion’. 
The Independent: This Singapore-based paper published a glowing article on the move titled “Modi does a Lee Kuan Yew to stamp out corruption in India.” Lee Kuan Yew was the Singaporean Prime Minister for several decades and is considered the architect of modern Singapore. “Government leaders feel that the sudden move by the Indian Prime Minister has brought new respect for him. 
Bloomberg: In an article published in leading American financial journal Bloomberg, Swiss global financial services company UBS Group AG said that Australia should follow India’s lead and scrap its biggest bank notes. 
“Removing large denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks,” UBS analysts led by Jonathan Mott said in a note to clients on Monday. Benefits would include reduced crime and welfare fraud, increased tax revenue and a “spike” in bank deposits. 
A senior Indian government official even equated Mr Modi to Singapore’s first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. From making up his mind to rolling it out on 8 Nov, a new Lee Kuan Yew is born in India. It will be reflected in the legacy of this Prime Minister,”.

22481,Nature: The Ultimate Cure,"Have you ever come back from a hike or camping trip feeling like your head is clearer? Science proves that nature can help your brain! 

A 2010 study from the University of Rochester found that spending time outdoors not only make you happier, it also can lead to an increased sense of vitality. This might explain why hikes and camps can make us feel so much more energized, both mentally and physically. According to research, nature can lead to a surge of energy. 

In an analysis of research on how nature can keep us calm, Adam Atler has found that being outside is similar to hitting the reset button on our brains. The key is through a process known as attention restoration theory. 

While man-made landscapes can sometimes over-stimulate our brains, natural landscapes give us the chance to think as much or as little as we’d like, there lies the opportunity to replenish our exhausted mental resources. 

Relieves Depression 

A quick walk in nature can really help your mind. A 2014 study found that participants who took group nature walks saw a host of mental-health benefits, including decreased depression and better moods. Taking a walk in nature also gives you exercise which is always great for your body and mental health. 

Creativity 

A 2012 study found that looking at the color green can spark inventiveness in your mind. Being outside can also distract your mind from a problem, and some of the best ideas come when we are not thinking about anything in the first place. 

Focus 

Cities can have negative influences on the brain, according to a 2012 study. There are so many distractions and things stimulating your brain, and these distractions impact the area of the brain that controls your directed attention and your self control . Nature can help subside and cure this. 

Stress 

Everyone wants to be less stressed. One small study published in the journal Landscape and Urban Planning found that adults who live in areas with the most amount of green space experience lower levels of cortisol, the hormone that causes stress. 

Research proves that being in nature can have a healing effect. It can also help reduce feelings of fear, and anger, lower blood pressure and contribute to the overall psychological well-being of all people.

22482,Quand l’art s’invite dans les usines de l’Oural,"Dictionnaire visuel Quand l’art s’invite dans les usines de l’Oural Depuis des temps reculés, l'Oural est synonyme d'industrie lourde : il fut un temps où la région était même la plus industrialisée au monde. Mais les temps changent, et cette région russe montagneuse est aujourd'hui plus célèbre pour ses projets artistiques. Nouvelles galeries, street art, Biennale d'Art de la Jeunesse… Les artistes émergents fourmillent, sans oublier les racines industrielles de la région. Faites défiler vers le bas pour voir plus Denis Tarasov Guennadi Vlassov est né en 1943 à Sverdlovsk (aujourd'hui Ekaterinebourg). Il est diplômé de l'école de commerce Ouralmach en 1961. OuralMach était un géant de la construction de machines, véritable étendard de l'industrie soviétique. Denis Tarasov Vlassov a travaillé comme artiste d'usine à partir de la fin des années 1960 jusqu'au début des années 1990. Il concevait des journaux muraux, écrivait des slogans et peignait des affiches satiriques. Denis Tarasov A la fin des années 1980, il aménage l'intérieur de la salle des outils de l'un des ateliers avec des répliques de célèbres paysages peints par des artistes russes et quelques unes de ses propres créations. Denis Tarasov Parmi les travaux connus, il a notamment copié la Fille à l'attelage en train de faucher par Arkadi Plastov, qui peignait des scènes de la vie quotidienne dans le style du réalisme socialiste. Denis Tarasov Dans les années 1980, les travailleurs eux-mêmes ont commencé à choisir des thèmes pour leurs armoires à outils – la plupart étaient des représentations de la nature. Au crépuscule de l'industrialisation, l'art était considéré comme un moyen de s'évader de la grisaille de l'usine. Denis Tarasov A l'heure de la modernisation, les peintures sont comme une bouffée d'air frais dans le royaume endormi des immenses machines condamnées au silence. Denis Tarasov Il y a quelques années, quelques uns de ces travaux ont fait leur apparition sur internet et ont retenu l'attention de plusieurs commissaires d'exposition d'Ekaterinebourg, qui ont présenté les conteneurs de Vlassov en tant que projet spécial lors de la Biennale d'art contemporain de la ville. Denis Tarasov Les conteneurs de Vlassov sont un exemple de la façon dont des objets de la vie de tous les jours se transforment en art contemporain une fois transposés dans une galerie. Denis Tarasov « Nous avons travaillé ici pendant des années et avons eu largement le temps de profiter de son art ! » , rigolent des travailleurs d'OuralMach en regardant passer des visiteurs de l'exposition. Denis Tarasov Le mot « exposition » est d'ailleurs un peu fourvoyé : malgré l'apparition de commissaires, de critiques d'art et de journalistes dans l'atelier, rien n'a vraiment changé à l'usine.

22483,"Exclusive-Roger Stone: In Speech Trump Must Stick to Agenda, Make One Good Reference to ’Fake News’ - Breitbart","The   man in American politics and one of the political mentors of President Donald Trump told Breitbart News Monday the president needs to stay focused on his program in his first address to a joint session of Congress. [“He needs to stick to the agenda,” said Roger Stone, who was one of the first advisers to join Trump’s campaign and remains one of his closest confidantes.  “Avoid    with his critics  —   just stick to the agenda  —   and make at least one good reference to fake news,” Stone said. Less than two months in, Stone said he is impressed by Trump’s performance in the White House. “I think he is doing great. ” Stone spoke to Breitbart News at a   book signing for his latest work: The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution at Washington’s   Hotel. The diverse crowd of   men of influence, conservative operatives, and Capitol Hill staffers was a pretty strong signal that it is very important in Washington that Stone knows you bought his book. The event was organized by David Urban, the man who led Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania. “Roger’s always been on the cutting edge,” Urban said. “He is always the guy you want on your team and I think the president was glad to have him on the team this year. ” Standing under a portrait of Lincoln’s trusted aide and biographer John Hay, Stone told the crowd that one of the insights in his book about the 2016 campaign is its similarity to the 1948 race between Republican New York Gov. Thomas Dewey and President Harry Truman. “The more I thought about it, Hillary Clinton is really Tom Dewey without the mustache: Cold, aloof, overconfident,” he said. “While Trump is barnstorming Democratic strongholds in Michigan and Wisconsin and Western Pennsylvania  —   Hillary’s in Chappaqua in her pajamas looking at the swatches to pick out fabric for her Oval Office curtains,” he said. Like Truman, Trump is a closer, he said. “Donald Trump is the greatest closer in American politics,” he said. “It was really a Herculean, superhuman effort. He drove himself  —   largely without sleep  —   on the basis of good data that said we could expand the map, we could win Michigan, we could win Wisconsin, we could win Pennsylvania and thus elect a man that I believe is destined to be one of our greatest presidents. ” Stone, who was a White House aide to President Richard Nixon and later introduced Nixon to Trump, told Breitbart News: “Both Nixon and Trump have obvious advantages and nobody is perfect, everyone has a flaw, but in terms of his intelligence, in terms of his speaking out for people who have been forgotten within our system, in terms of his executive ability, and in terms of his toughness and his pragmatism  —   n all those ways he is like Nixon. ” Like Nixon, Trump is going to figure how to deal with the Washington and Republican establishments. “I did look at a White House staff list yesterday and I had to stop myself  —   I actually recognized a name,” he said. “His greatest danger is not from the liberal Democrats. It’s from establishment Republicans, who like the status quo and might seek to undermine his program  —   unless of course, they determine that their program is so popular that they better get on board quick and claim they were for it the whole time. ”",0
22485,"Canada’s Largest School System Cancels USA Trips, Fears Travel Ban","The largest school district in Canada has canceled all future trips to the U. S. A. over fears that some of its students may be impacted by President Donald Trump’s travel order putting a temporary moratorium on travel from a list of   countries. [The Toronto School District announced its new policy on March 23 saying that no student or staff trips would be planned for the U. S. until further notice, according to The Washington Post.  School officials made the   decision despite the fact that Canada is not on the list of seven countries identified by President Obama’s administration and as adopted by the Trump administration as dangerous due to rampant terrorism and deeply entrenched terror networks. “We strongly believe that our students should not be placed into these situations of potentially being turned away at the border,” Toronto School District Director of Education John Malloy said in a statement released on Thursday. The district did allow that all the trips already planned will go ahead as intended, but that future trips are on hold. “We do not make this decision lightly, but given the uncertainty of these new travel restrictions and when they may come into effect, if at all, we strongly believe that our students should not be placed into these situations of potentially being turned away at the border,” the statement reads. “The TDSB remains committed to ensuring that fairness, equity, and inclusion are essential principles of our school system and are integrated into all our policies, programs, operations, and practices, including school trips. ” The district also warned that if any student’s identification is questioned at the U. S. border, the trip will be canceled on the spot and all students will be taken back home. “Rest assured, we will continue to monitor this situation very closely and should we receive additional information or clarification with regards to what students could expect at the U. S. border, we may revisit these decisions,” the statement concludes. “However, based on all the information we currently have available to us, we feel this is the right action to take at this time. ” The Toronto school system serves over 289, 000 students in 451 elementary schools, 110 secondary schools, as well as five adult education centers. The Toronto schools aren’t the only Canadian schools to cancel trips to the U. S. The Greater Essex County District School Board of Windsor, Ontario, also recently canceled trips over the border.

22487,Nicki Minaj Offers to Pay Twitter Fans’ College Tuition,"New York (AFP)  —     star Nicki Minaj has promised to pay university tuition for dozens of fans after a promotional contest metamorphosed over Twitter. [Minaj’s transformation into educational benefactor took place over the weekend as she unveiled a contest of the sort popular among celebrities seeking an online buzz.  Minaj invited her 20 million Twitter followers to make their own videos for one of her new songs for a chance to win a trip to Las Vegas to see her perform at the Billboard Music Awards later this month. But when one respondent said she would rather have help paying tuition, Minaj agreed. “Show me straight A’s that I can verify with your school and I’ll pay it. Who wants to join THAT contest? !?! Dead serious,” she tweeted. Minaj soon had made promises in response to more than 30 tweets seeking help paying university tuition, which can be notoriously expensive in the United States, or to cover student loans or textbooks. One Twitter user  —   whose handle is Dash Minaj in apparent tribute to the rapper  —   was overjoyed after she pledged to pay the $1, 800 he said he needed to resume his studies at Ohio University. “My idol is paying for me to go back to school. I’m literally in  …     tears,” he tweeted. Minaj ended the spree by tweeting, “It’s been fun. Let me make those payments tomorrow then see if I have any money left. I’ll do some more in a month or two. ” Minaj, who was born in Trinidad and raised in New York, won a spot at the city’s prestigious public LaGuardia High School for aspiring artists and did not go on to university. In March, the    Minaj surpassed Aretha Franklin as the female artist who has had the most songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart of top US singles. Minaj has landed 76 songs on the chart after releasing three singles in March, including her latest collaboration with superstar Drake. Forbes magazine estimated that Minaj earned $20. 5 million in the 12 months to June 2016, making her the only woman among the year’s richest   artists.",0
22489,NBC ’Freaking Out’ over ’Ratings Disaster’ Megyn Kelly: Report - Breitbart,"NBC is reportedly “freaking out” because the network’s   talent Megyn Kelly has already been a “ratings disaster. ”  “They didn’t pay her $15 million for this. They are now worried that her numbers will be bad when she joins the 9 am hour of Today,” a source reportedly told Radar Online. “If Kelly tanks at 9 am she will also bring down Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb at 10 am. ” The debut of Kelly’s Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly, with its   Vladimir Putin interview, could not even beat out a rerun of 60 Minutes. Her second show got clobbered as well. As Radar Online noted, Kelly’s interview with Erin Andrews “was destroyed by 60 Minutes, which scored 7. 66 million total viewers. Kelly got a paltry 4. 35 million people to tune in to her program. ” Already in desperation mode, NBC is reportedly “scrambling” to land big “gets” like Kathy Griffin or Adrianna Grande because, according to the source, the network seems to have already determined that “people are not tuning in to watch Megyn without huge guests. ” After reportedly being rejected multiple times, Kelly finally found a producer for her daily   morning show just last Friday. Veteran producer Jackie Levin agreed to produce the show, which is set to debut in September. NBC News reportedly had trouble locking down an executive producer for Kelly’s daily   show for months. According to one television insider, though “NBC and Megyn Kelly would like you to believe” her show did not have an executive producer because “there are just so many great people lining up for the job,” it was “quite the opposite. ” According to the insider’s source, Kelly and NBC had “approached some big names and they have all said no. ” Kelly reportedly wanted Bill Geddie, Barbara Walters’ longtime producer, to run her morning show. But he reportedly turned her down in addition to other top names because “no one wants to take the gig and most of the blame if Kelly flops at NBC. ” NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack has reportedly been busy lowering expectations for Kelly to the network’s affiliates. When news of NBC’s hiring of Kelly broke, one executive reportedly said that “the degree of difficulty” would be “extremely high” for Kelly and if she does not succeed, “she could end up fading into obscurity,” especially since her trial run at Fox News for a   show was panned and got terrible ratings.",0
22491,BREAKING : MASSIVE CORRUPTION AS OBAMA BLOCKS FBI FROM INVESTIGATING NEW EMAILS – TruthFeed,"BREAKING : MASSIVE CORRUPTION AS OBAMA BLOCKS FBI FROM INVESTIGATING NEW EMAILS BREAKING : MASSIVE CORRUPTION AS OBAMA BLOCKS FBI FROM INVESTIGATING NEW EMAILS Breaking News By Amy Moreno October 30, 2016 
Obama and his DOJ are actively BLOCKING the FBI’s attempts to investigate the thousands of new emails they discovered on Huma and Weiner’s desktop computer. 
They are SUPPRESSING information to help Hillary win the election. Obama’s DOJ is REFUSING to access a warrant that would allow FBI officials to read any of the newly discovered Abedin emails. They are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen. 
From Liberty Writers : “WE DO NOT HAVE A WARRANT,” A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL SAID. “DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDER WAY [BETWEEN THE FBI AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT] AS TO THE BEST WAY TO MOVE FORWARD.” Obama’s Justice Dept. is stonewalling Comey’s entire FBI investigation because they know the findings will put an end to Hilllary Clinton’s political career. Comey already upset Loretta Lynch and the DOJ by reopening the investigation in the first place. Top Justice Department officials “strongly discouraged” Comey from continuing the investigation because of the election. A U.S official familiar with the matter said “ He was acting independently of the guidance given to him.” Comey insisted in his message to agents that he felt he had an obligation to inform Congress about the new material and it would be “misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” This new attempt to block the investigation seems like a way to punish Comey for putting the American people before politics. We the people have a RIGHT to see those emails! The American people are at WAR with their government right now. KEEP FIGHTING!

22494,Trump: Vaccines Cause Autism And Will Be Investigated,"President-elect Donald Trump believes vaccines are responsible for the autism epidemic and he has promised to find out the truth and “save our children and their future” when he takes office in January. 
Via YourNewsWire 
Trump dismissed the official claim that there is no link between vaccines and autism, claiming there has been a cover up to suppress the truth and that “nay-sayers will understand soon.”
Scroll Down For Video Below “[W]e’ve had so many instances, people that work for me. Just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.”
Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes – AUTISM. Many such cases!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2014 

During a GOP a primary debate with Trump, Dr. Ben Carson claimed there is no “documented proof” that vaccines are responsible for autism, however Dr. Carson, a neuroscientist, conceded that “it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.”
"" @P01YN0NYM0U55 : @jamandatrtl #vaccines #Shills insist #Autism starts in utero or genetic, but parents insist sudden onset after #vaccine ""
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2014 

Trump’s response echoes one he gave on Fox News in April 2012, in which he also related the story of a child of one of his employees who was damaged after receiving vaccines.
“I’ve gotten to be pretty familiar with the subject,” Trump told Fox News’ Fox & Friends. “You know, I have a theory — and it’s a theory that some people believe in — and that’s the vaccinations. We never had anything like this.
“This is now an epidemic. It’s way, way up over the past 10 years. It’s way up over the past two years. And, you know, when you take a little baby that weighs like 12 pounds into a doctor’s office and they pump them with many, many simultaneous vaccinations — I’m all for vaccinations, but I think when you add all of these vaccinations together and then two months later the baby is so different then lots of different things have happened. I really — I’ve known cases.”
The vaccine autism link recently came under federal scrutiny when Florida US Congressman Bill Posey noted before a House committee the testimony of Center for Disease Control whistle-blower Bill Thompson, who claimed the agency colluded with researchers to destroy documents linking the injection to thousands of autism cases.
I am being proven right about massive vaccinations—the doctors lied. Save our children & their future.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2014 

On July 29, US Congressman Bill Posey made his last stand on the floor of the House. Granted five minutes to speak, he exposed lies by the CDC in the infamous 2004 study that exonerated the MMR vaccine and claimed it had no connection to autism.
“No connection to autism” was the lie. Congressman Posey read a statement by long-term CDC researcher William Thompson, one of the authors of the 2004 Pediatrics study designed to determine once and for all if the MMR vaccine has contributed to the autism epidemic.
“…the [CDC] co-authors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the [MMR vaccine] study. The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage can.”
With Trump in the White House with full executive powers the vaccine autism link is about to come under it’s most severe scrutiny yet.

22498,UN Expert: Israel Has Entrenched ‘Colonial-Style Regime’ In West Bank,"Videos UN Expert: Israel Has Entrenched ‘Colonial-Style Regime’ In West Bank “The diminished geographic territory available to Palestinians is directly linked to Israel’s extensive and expanding settlement project, including its network of highways, adjacent lands and extensive military-security apparatus.” | November 1, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Israeli soldiers check the IDs of Palestinians near an Israeli checkpoint near Nablus, in the Israeli occupied West Bank, Tuesday, June 3, 2014. 
A United Nations human rights expert has slammed “Israel’s entrenchment of a colonial-like regime in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”, citing “two separate and unequal systems” with respect to laws, road network, justice system, access to water, freedom of movement, civil rights, and more. 
Michael Lynk , the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, made the remarks in his new report, presented to the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday. 
Lynk described the Palestinian economy as “without parallel in the modern world.” 
“No other society in the world faces such an array of cumulative challenges that includes belligerent occupation, territorial discontinuity, political and administrative divergence, geographic confinement and economic disconnectedness”, he said. 
The official highlighted a number of Israeli violations of human rights, including administrative detention: “The numbers are staggering”, Lynk wrote, “and are suggestive of an overarching policy that aims to intimidate and significantly restrict the freedoms of Palestinians.” 
Lynk also referred to the Israeli government’s use of punitive home demolitions, which he noted was used on 11 occasions in 2015, displacing 85, while as of July 2016, there had already been 16 demolitions, displacing 92 people. 
“Punitive demolitions, the purpose of which is to harm the family members of someone suspected of a crime, are in clear violation of the basic tenets of international law.” 
Taking a look at the big picture, Lynk described “separate and unequal development in the West Bank, and particularly in Area C,” leading “to the creation of two starkly different legal, economic and political universes within one territory.” 
Israeli settlers enjoy “a vastly superior system of laws, roads, judicial systems, personal mobility, security, economic opportunities, civil and political rights and living standards than the West Bank Palestinians among whom they live.” 
With the 50th anniversary approaching, Lynk said the “the duration of the occupation has lasted well beyond any reasonable length for any Occupying Power acting in good faith.” 
“The diminished geographic territory available to Palestinians is directly linked to Israel’s extensive and expanding settlement project, including its network of highways, adjacent lands and extensive military-security apparatus.” 
Indeed, he continued, “without Israel’s settlement project, there would be no rationale for the continuing occupation.” 
The Special Rapporteur was unable to visit the OPT due to Israeli non-cooperation, and he pointed out “the duty of Member States to cooperate with the UN human rights mechanisms as a fundamental obligation.” Lynk met with civil society groups and relevant organisations in Amman.

22501,2 Bailiffs Shot to Death at Michigan Courthouse - The New York Times,"Two court bailiffs were shot and killed by a prisoner who managed to grab a law enforcement officer’s gun inside a Michigan courthouse on Monday afternoon, and the prisoner himself was then killed, a county sheriff said. The shooting followed a struggle as officials were trying to transfer the prisoner from a holding cell to a courtroom where he was to appear before a judge, said Paul Bailey, the Berrien County sheriff. The prisoner broke free, shot and wounded a sheriff’s deputy, then fatally shot the two bailiffs before shooting another person who was standing in a courthouse hallway, Sheriff Bailey said. The prisoner was then shot and killed, apparently by officials who rushed to the hallway. “It’s a sad day,” Sheriff Bailey said, noting that he had known the bailiffs for decades they had worked in other law enforcement roles before taking the courthouse jobs. Officials said they were uncertain how the inmate had grabbed a gun  —   and did not yet know whose weapon he grabbed  —   but said that routine procedures had been followed for bringing jail inmates to court appearances in Berrien County, in the southwest part of the state. Sheriff Bailey later identified the prisoner as Larry Darnell Gordon, 45, and the bailiffs who were killed as Joseph Zangaro, 61, and Ronald Kienzle, 63, The Associated Press said. Standing behind Sheriff Bailey during an evening news conference, Gov. Rick Snyder called the shooting an “awful act,” and urged residents to stand together in Michigan and elsewhere. “I ask that all Michiganders put your prayers out, your thoughts and prayers,” Mr. Snyder said. “This is a particularly tough time for law enforcement. ” The courthouse is in St. Joseph, a community of about 8, 200 people on Lake Michigan and the seat of Berrien County.",0

22508,Independents Tilt Decisively to Trump,"Independents Tilt Decisively to Trump October 31, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
Independents are the largest political group in the country. Larger than either Democrats or Republicans. And they're tilting toward Trump and the GOP. 
Adding in ideology, the tracking poll shows Clinton going from 95 percent support among liberal Democrats early in the tracking poll to 88 percent now, while Trump's gone from 89 percent among conservative Republicans to 94 percent now. 
Independents -– sometimes swing voters in past elections, albeit inconsistently –- also merit attention. They've gone from a scant 6 points in Clinton's favor in the first four nights of tracking, 44-38 percent, to a substantial Trump lead now, 34-51 percent, Clinton-Trump. 
A key element here is the partisan preferences of independents who emerge as likely to vote: They were 2 points more likely to lean toward the Republican Party rather than the Democratic Party at the start of tracking, but are 10 points more apt to do so now. 
Hillary Clinton tried to win over independents by positioning her brand as a moderate centrist who can work with Republicans and can get things done while portraying Trump as dangerous and irresponsible. It certainly worked to a degree. 
Trump's pitch was that he's not a conventional Republican and he can overturn a rigged system. The drain the swamp speech was a key element. The latter is more likely to ultimately appeal to people who identify as none of the above because they're disgusted with both parties.",0
22509,HE’S NEVER SOLD AN ORIGINAL PAINTING UNTIL NOW…And This One’s Going In The White House,"John McNaughton is a special American painter because of his subject matter and the intensity in which he portrays our current government…troubled and corrupt. The Forgotten Man painting is amazing in its symbolism. 
Here’s how McNaughton describes the painting: 
Against the background of a darkening sky, all of the past Presidents of the United States gather before the White House, as if to commemorate some great event. In the left hand corner of the painting sits a man. That man, with his head bowed appears distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future. Some of the past Presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern Presidents as if to say, “What have you done?” Many of these modern Presidents, seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves, appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments. In front of the man, paper trash is blowing in the wind. Crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, and, like a whisper—the U.S. Constitution beneath the foot of Barack Obama. 
THE FORGOTTEN MAN… 
McNaughton never sells his original paintings BUT he made an exception this time. He sold this painting to Sean Hannity so Hannity could give it to Donald Trump. Awesome, huh? 
November 9th McNaughton announced via facebook that he sold the original to Sean Hannity: 
“Sean Hannity just purchased my painting “The Forgotten Man” to give to Donald Trump to hang in the White House”

22510,Jake Tapper Fact Checks The Hell Out Of Trump Campaign’s Assassination Lie (VIDEO),"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
By now, we all know that the Secret Service had to rush GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump off the stage at a rally in Reno, Nevada on Saturday night. It turned out to be nothing – just a protester with a sign. At the time it all looked pretty chaotic and frightening, but it turned out that Trump was just fine. The “gun” turned out to be an anti-Trump poster. The man turned out to be a Republican who just wanted the opportunity to protest what Trump had done to his party with a “Republicans against Trump” sign. There was no threat. 
Those facts don’t matter to the Trump team, though, as campaign manager Kellyanne Conway went on CNN’s State of the Union and insisted to host Jake Tapper that it was indeed a very real attempt on Trump’s life. 
First, Tapper inquired as to why Trump’s people were “retweeting misinformation that this was an assassination attempt.” Conway responded: 
“It’s scary. All the coverage is usually about our protesters wreaking havoc and making people feel afraid. And it certainly goes both ways. I’m with Mr. Trump and the Secret Service routinely. They do an amazing job. 
I also want to point out because some people are spreading misinformation about the protester. He had canvassed for Hillary Clinton and he had donated to her campaign. So, this is a Democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally. And I think people saw a nimble resilient Donald Trump who would be nimble and resilient as president as well.” 
Tapper called Conway on her bullshit, though, and shot back: 
“Except it wasn’t an assassination attempt. It was apparently a local voter, a Republican who says he is supporting Hillary Clinton. He has given money to Hillary Clinton. He has canvassed for Hillary Clinton. But he says he’s a Republican. But most importantly, he was not trying to assassinate anyone.” 
This was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was?” 
Conway waffled, saying, “That’s really remarkable. That that’s what the storyline is here.” 
Of course, she then did what Trumpkins backed into corners always do, and tried to start changing the subject to the imagined sins of Hillary Clinton. She insisted that the only reason Beyonce, Jay Z and other A-List stars were on the trail with Hillary was that nobody wanted to go to Hillary rallies. Finally, Conway said she’d consider changing the assassination lie if CNN went on the record against “all the storylines, all the headlines, all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that turned out not to be true.” 
Tapper said to that: 
“I never reported anything along those lines.” 
And irritable Conway insisted: 
“CNN certainly has. You’ve got to be honest here.” 
Tapper continued, “We’ve been saying all along that Donald Trump has a path to the presidency.” 
Conway then interjected with her trademark “WOW!” 
Tapper plowed on, though, and nailed the humiliation home, and actually laughed in her face, saying: 
“You can say ‘wow’ all you want, I’ve never said that the race was over. We can replay as many tapes as you want.” 
Tapper was right to hammer Conway like this. Trump’s entire campaign has been one big con job, built upon fear, ignorance, bigotry, incompetence, and lies. It’s about time someone called them out for what they really are.

22513,Undocumented Migrants To Be Made To Hand Over Mobile Phones,"Migrants who arrive in Germany without identification papers or a passport may soon have their mobile phones confiscated so that authorities can determine their country of origin. [The number of migrants arriving in Germany with no form of identification has been on the rise, especially among underage migrants, or those who claim to be underage. The Federal Agency for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has had a hard time determining the age or country of origin of the migrants, but that may change as the government looks to allow them to examine the migrants’ mobile phones Die Welt reports.  Hesse Prime Minister Volker Bouffier is the politician behind the idea and met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Thursday to discuss its implementation.  Prime Minister Bouffier, who is also a member of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) said that the searching of phones by BAMF, “should be possible with this new legislation, we believe this is imperative. ” Bouffier made it clear that he does not want the legislation to give carte blanche to officials to search all migrants mobile phones, but only in cases in which BAMF cannot clearly identify the person’s age or place of origin. Chancellor Merkel said that the authorities should be allowed to have the ability to check mobile phones and that it may already be possibly legal. An undercover investigation last year by journalist Abdullah Khan revealed the extent of how many migrants come to Germany without papers and often use it to their advantage. Mr. Khan spent several months working at the migrant reception centre and said, “Many pose as minors travelling alone, because word has spread that they will qualify for more benefits.   …     To lie about their age, many people use false passports and other identity documents. ” The journalist described encountering a migrant who claimed originally to be from Afghanistan but spoke in Urdu, the language most commonly used in Pakistan and when confronted presented an obviously forged Afghan passport. Searching mobile phones may also help determine asylum seekers that could have links to radical Islamist groups like the Islamic State. Earlier this month the terror group offered to cover smuggling costs for migrants who promised to join them and wage jihad in Europe. Dutch researchers Joris van Wijk and Maarten Bolhuis have said that it is virtually impossible for governments to determine which asylum seekers may have links to radical Islamists because many are told by terrorist groups to act as normally as possible and not to arouse any suspicion.

22514,Ancient Script Found: The Nephilim Once Walked On Earth,"Ancient manuscript tells of ancient giant race visiting Earth.

The Qumran caves in the West Bank have been considered a veritable treasure trove for historians, particularly those specialising in ancient literature and mythology. Sixty years ago, archaeologists unearthed an ancient book in these caves which is referred to as ‘The Book of Giants’. This text gives the details about an ancient race of otherworldly creatures who existed and eventually died out on Earth.


At this current time, there is very little that historians can deduce about the authorship of ‘The Book of Giants’. However, it has been noted that there are remarkable crossovers between this mysterious text and other known ancient manuscripts such as the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh and the apocryphal Book of Enoch. [Mahway] mounted up in the air like strong winds, and flew with his hands like eagles […he left behind] the inhabited world and passed over Desolation, the great desert […]and Enoch saw him and hailed him, and Mahway said to him […] hither and thither a second time to Mahway […]The Giants await your words and all the monsters of the earth. If […]has been carried […] from the days of […]their […] and they would be added […] we would know from you their meaning […] two hundred trees that from heaven came down… The Book of the Giants describes the creatures as ‘two hundred trees from heaven’ which came down and populated the planet Earth. They are described as a corrupt and debased species, prone to hideous acts of violence and unnatural acts with animals and human beings. After a period of years, one of the giants Mahway, started to experience prophetic dreams. These dreams saw a tablet bearing the names of everyone on Earth being submerged beneath the water. When the tablet rose again, all but three of the names had been washed away by the waves. This particular passage has been interpreted as referring to the survival of Noah and his family after the great flood.


It was when Mahway shared these visions with his fellow giants that they realised the futility of attempting to resist the forces of heaven. They decided to seek out Enoch and ask him to plead to God on their behalf. Enoch is an ancient Jewish mythological figure believed to be the great-grandfather of Noah. He has a reference in the Book of Genesis where he is described as having a special, personal relationship with God. He lived for an astonishing three hundred and sixty-five years before simply disappearing with God one day. Enoch interceded on behalf of the Giants and delivered a damning judgement to them from God. However, he promised them that there was some hope for their redemption.

It is assumed that the Giants were washed away in the great flood that devastated the world several generations after that. What the race did in the interim is still a matter of great mystery. Another mystery is what this giant race could have been. The fact that they are described as coming down from heaven strongly suggests that there were of an extra-terrestrial origin, which has led some to speculate that the ‘giants’ may have been the heavily mythologised race of ancient aliens called the Nephilim.

Phelps commented on the big game, his trademark Phelps face, and hosting the Big Game Big Give poker tournament Saturday night in Houston. “As an athlete you root to watch athletes do great and remarkable and impressive things that have never been done before. So you look at Tom (Brady) having a chance to win his fifth (Super Bowl) you gotta root for him,” Phelps said. But then he added: “I’m keeping it more political and rooting for both sides.

Video reveals that the “spontaneous” anti-Trump protesters are actually paid agitators bused in courtesy of the George Soros machine 
EDITOR’S NOTE: Video taken on the ground in Chicago yesterday show block after block of buses that are being used to bring in professional agitators to protest Donald Trump’s landslide victory over Hillary Clinton. Who is paying for all these buses bringing in all these protesters? Why, it’s our old friend George Soros, of course. And he is playing his favorite card, the race card. Soros, you will recall, spent millions busing in agitators to fuel the race riots in Ferguson , Baltimore and Chicago . 
From Zero Hedge: Earlier today we showed that, contrary to USA Today’s claims that the anti-Trump protests across the nation are “spontaneous, involving people from all walks of life”, according to Wikileaks documents at least two of the people profiled by USA Today have a history of being professional agitators for the Democratic party, whose task is to stir up popular protests and – in extreme cases – unleash rioting, such as the following clip showing the latest day of violent protests in Portland revealed.

22517,Russia and Syria Warn About US Shifting ISIS from Mosul to Battle Assad,"Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN A previous article explained the so-called battle for Mosul is a hoax. It’s about shifting thousands of US-supported ISIS fighters to Syria, along with perhaps letting Turkish forces move in to control evacuated areas. In Moscow, Russian and Syrian foreign ministers expressed concern. Sergey Lavrov said Moscow will “take measures to prevent terrorists moving from Mosul to Syria with their heavy arms, which, of course, will seriously worsen the situation in the Syrian republic.” .. “We think that it is important not to let this happen…We cannot let the terrorist leave Mosul (for) Syria with the aim to re-direct their activity.” .. Syrian Foreign Walid al-Muallem said the US-led “coalition has never fought Daesh. On the contrary, it is destroying the infrastructure of the Syrian economy, and recently destroyed a huge number of bridges on the Euphrates River…They want to move Daesh from Mosul into Raqqa.” .. Assad close political and media advisor Bouthaina Shaaban explained Washington’s dirty scheme, ignored by media scoundrels, saying redeploying ISIS fighters from Mosul to Syria would represent a “huge danger to our sovereignty, to our country.” .. “Russia and Syria are looking at this issue extremely seriously. We’re not going to sit and watch…The way they encircle Mosul shows they would like these terrorists to move into to Syria…They’re navigating terrorism from one place to another, limiting terrorism in one place, directing it to another place. That’s the absolute truth of what is happening in our region.” .. Washington and its rogue allies pay lip service alone to fighting terrorism while actively supporting it. So-called “moderates” aren’t so “moderate,” Shaaban explained. “There are no ’Syrian moderates.’ “ .. They’re cold-blooded cutthroat killers, imperial death squads, serving US imperial interests, actively supported by its coalition partners wanting Assad toppled, Syrian sovereignty destroyed, an Israeli rival eliminated, and Iran isolated ahead of repeating the same scenario against its government. .. Aided by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah fighters, Syria is engaged in the “most challenging issue for humanity in the 21st century,” Shaaban stressed – the struggle to defeat the scourge of US created and supported terrorism, threatening everyone everywhere unless challenged and eliminated. .. America intends stopping at nothing to advance its imperium – its goal, unchallenged dominion over planet earth, its resources and populations – a world unfit and unsafe to live in. Beginning with the Bill and Hillary Clinton co-presidency’s Balkan wars, culminating with the 1999 rape of Yugoslavia, all sovereign independent states have been targeted for regime change – the 9/11 false flag used as pretext to wage phony war on terrorism. .. 
Syria is in the eye of the storm. Conflicts continue raging in all countries America attacked after that staged incident – effectively declaring war on humanity. Will nuclear war on Russia, China and Iran follow Hillary’s likely ascension to power next year? Her rage for wanting their sovereign governments eliminated risks ending life on earth.

22522,Что Джон Керри забыл на Южном полюсе? | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: США в мире В своей новой статье постоянный обозреватель НВО Сит Феррис отмечает, что в самый важный для правящих элит в США день — 8 ноября, Госсекретарь США Джон Керри, которого по праву считают одним из тяжеловесов современной политики, не участвовал в голосовании, пытаясь оказать поддержку демократической партии. Более того, его даже не было на территории США, поскольку он отправился на секретную военную базу Вашингтона на Южном полюсе. Автор отмечает, что удаленные военные инсталляции армии США хорошо известны своими «вольными нравами» и повсеместным злоупотреблением наркотиками. Однако едва ли действующий Госсекретарь США захотел «оттянуться в экзотическом месте» в самый важный для его хозяев день. Более того, инспекция засекреченных военных объектов не входит в список обязанностей «главного дипломата» Соединенных Штатов. Автор отмечает, что американцы отправились за нацистами, которые обосновали свою военную базу в Антарктиде сразу после Второй мировой войны. Американская военная история даже хранит сведения о штурме военных объектов нацистской Германии, в котором участвовало около четырех тысяч человек. Более того, как в семидесятых годах обнаружили многие состоятельные американские туристы, Соединенные Штаты не только незаконно оккупировали Южный и Северный полюса, они полностью перекрыли к ним доступ любых «неавторизованных» лиц. Что происходит на данных базах можно понять, если взглянуть на лабораторию биологического оружия США в Грузии, где по-прежнему продолжают разрабатывать боевые виды различных вирусов. А потому с какой бы целью Керри не поехал на Южный полюс, будь то подготовка устранения будущего президента Соединенных Штатов, либо же попытка замаскировать «грязные делишки» нынешней администрации от внимательных глаз Дональда Трампа — правда весьма скоро проявит себя. Ведь Керри, как и представители семейства Бушей, является членом полумасонской нацистской организации «Череп и Кости», которая больше чем кто-либо знает о связях Вашингтона с фашистами. А потому не удивительно, что со «срочной миссией» на Южный полюс отправили именно его. С полной версией статьи вы можете ознакомиться здесь . Популярные статьи ",0
22523,Populist Outsider Geert Wilders in Combative Mood as the Netherlands Prepares to Go to the Polls,"The traditionally liberal Netherlands will go to the polls Wednesday morning to select new members of parliament and perhaps a new government, and   migration, Eurosceptic Geert Wilders is fighting to come out on top in a contest which has seen his ratings dented in recent weeks. [Riding high in polls that would have seen him comfortably take over 30 of the 150 seats in the Dutch parliament, leaving his Party for Freedom (PVV) the largest force in national politics, recent polls have shown his lead diminished or even wiped out by the prime minister’s government conservatives.  The elections are the first in five years since the 2012 vote which was prompted by Wilders’ PVV pulling out of an informal agreement to support the conservatives as a junior partner. If Mr. Wilders’ PVV comes out of Wednesday’s vote the largest party, it could mean a major role reversal with the conservatives joining a   coalition. However, even if Mr. Wilders’ party performs in a way analogous to President Donald J. Trump in the U. S. and Brexit in the United Kingdom to defy   bad polling to come out on top, his ambition to become prime minister could still be frustrated by a rainbow coalition of other parties uniting to keep him out of power. A   ‘purple’ coalition in Dutch parlance could see Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s conservatives or even the Socialist Party propped up by the dozen remaining smaller groups in a desperate effort to keep Wilders out, at any cost. Previous remarks by Rutte made clear he wasn’t interested in a coalition with Wilders, but the prospect of easy power without having to enter agreements with hard left parties could be too good to resist. Despite the odds to overcome, Mr. Wilders remained in a combative mood on the last day of campaigning Tuesday, telling listeners on national radio that if they wanted the country to be flooded with migrants then they should consider voting for the   green party. Mr. Wilders has also been extremely vocal on the ongoing diplomatic spat between the Netherlands and Turkey, over the presence of Turkish ministers in the country for campaign rallies. Turkey is hosting a referendum in April over expanding powers for President Erdoğan and has been extensively courting the votes of Turkish migrants in Europe who still have the ability to cast ballots in their home nation. Rhetoric between Turkey and the Netherlands has become heated, with Erdoğan going so far as to call the Dutch “Nazi remnants”. Following the remarks, Mr. Wilders demanded the government expel the Turkish ambassador, saying to do any less would be an insult to all of the Netherlands.",0

AUSTIN, TX—Anxiously wondering what kind of impression he was leaving on university admissions officials, wealthy father Gordon Fring was said to be waiting restlessly for responses this week after mailing donations to his son’s top college choices. “I sent in contributions to eight different schools all over the country and haven’t heard anything back yet,” said Fring, who added that while he submitted large sums to each of the private universities, he knew that thousands of other high school seniors’ well-off parents had done the exact same thing, so at the end of the day, it was just a crapshoot. “I really hope I get positive news from Duke. My son’s wanted to go there forever, and I feel really good about the amount of cash I sent them, so hopefully I have a decent shot. Fingers crossed.” At press time, sources reported that Fring had become excited after receiving an envelope from Vanderbilt, only to quickly grow dejected upon opening it and finding a simple form letter thanking him for his gift.

22532,Poroshenko apologizes to Lukashenko for threat to shoot down civilian plane,"Poroshenko apologizes to Lukashenko for threat to shoot down civilian plane November 11, 2016 - Fort Russ News - PolitRussia - translated by J. Arnoldski - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has apologized to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko for the incident with the civilian Belavia airliner . During a telephone conversation, the Ukrainian leader also informed Poroshenko that the perpetrators of the incident will be punished. The two heads of state agreed that their countries’ relevant services will soon hold consultations on security issues to prevent such incidents in the future. On October 21st, a Belavia civilian flight was forced to return to the Zhulyany airport near Kiev after being threatened by Ukrainian fighter jets. After landing, the SBU detained one of its passengers, the chairman of the board of the Civil Union international public organization, Armen Martirosyan, who was soon after released. Minsk expressed its protest against the incident to Kiev. A memo sent to Kiev said “the Belarusian side expects an official apology and demands compensation for all losses and expenses caused by the Ukrainian side’s actions.” Ukraine’s security services initially denied that fighter jets threatened the civilian plane, but the Belarusian side published the transcript of the conversation between the crew commander and dispatcher. Afterwards, Belavia reported that Ukraine agreed to pay “small compensation” for the incident. The passenger over whom Kiev landed the plane has filed a lawsuit against Ukrainian authorities.

22533,Donald Trump's campaign staff just revoked his Twitter privileges,"Zach Cartwright | November 6, 2016 
One of the most prolific Twitter users in the world is being denied his favorite medium of communication in the days before the election. 
According to the New York Times, Donald Trump’s social media usage is being stymied by top campaign aides, in an effort to keep the Republican presidential nominee from straying off message as voters prepare to cast their ballots. Calling the revocation of Trump’s sole control over the @realDonaldTrump account an “essential move” prior to Election Day, the Times reported that Trump’s tweets are now being closely screened by top communications aide Hope Hicks , who approves every tweet before it’s fired off into the world. 
Trump’s tweeting has previously landed him in rough waters, such as a flurry of tweets fired off at 3 AM about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who the billionaire reality TV host once referred to as “Miss Piggy” in reference to her weight gain following the pageant, and “Miss Housekeeper” in reference to her Latina upbringing. Trump also encouraged his 13 million followers to “check out” a sex tape allegedly featuring Machado. The tweets came after a debate with Hillary Clinton, who brought up her rival’s treatment of the beauty queen near the end of the 90-minute debate. Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.

Trump has frequently used his account on the popular social media platform to attack his political rivals on both sides of the aisle. In 2012, Trump tweeted his doubts that President Barack Obama was born in the United States, and to peddle fears about the Ebola virus. He’s also tweeted insulting remarks about prominent women in society, given unsolicited advice to celebrities about their relationships, and fired off insults at random people. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama 's birth certificate is a fraud.

22539,Sheryl Crow Uses ’Deep Meditation’ to Stave Off Fear of Trump Apocalypse,"Musician Sheryl Crow says she turned to meditation to confront fears of Donald Trump’s “apocalyptic” presidency. [In an interview with Rolling Stone published Monday, the      said a song from her latest album titled “Heartbeat Away”  —   in which a president launches nuclear weapons  —   was written before Trump received the Republican nomination.  “My sleep has been disturbed. My insides are ridden with unease,” Crow told the outlet. “I wrote that song before Trump got the nomination  —   it already felt apocalyptic that people were entertaining the idea of making a man like that the most powerful person in the world. ” “Heartbeat Away” is a track on Crow’s latest studio album, Be Myself, which was released April 21. The lyrics of the song include references to the unnamed president’s possible connections to Russia, including a reference to Russia “blowing up the phone. ” “I had to go into deep meditation and find a way to have compassion for the people of this country that are hurting and believe [Trump] cares about them,” the     told Rolling Stone. “I’m worried, but my meditation teacher said something fascinating. Her phrase was, ‘This is the way forward. ’” In her interview, Crow also opened up about her battle with brain cancer and how it felt to have been embraced by some of her musical idols through her   career in the music industry. “My idea for music was that I didn’t want to be great. I wanted to be important,” she explained. “I wanted to write important music, and so, when you start having a music career and you’re certainly not one of the cool kids, but you’re embraced by the older class  —   I was just like, ‘Wow, I can’t believe these people know me.’ As hokey as it might sound, I still feel really humbled by that. ” Crow has previously spoken out about her dislike of Trump. In an October appearance on The View, the singer said she doesn’t let her children watch television when Trump is on screen. “I want to be able to say to my kids, being the president of the United States is the most honorable position and it needs to go back to that and we need to change the dialogue,” she said at the time.

22541,"‘Climate Emergency': North Pole Sees Record Temps, Melting Ice Despite Arctic Winter","Source: Common Dreams 
Arctic is losing ice and heating up despite seasonal onset of 24-hour darkness—phenomena that break all previous records 
As 2016 continues on its march toward becoming the hottest year on record , the Arctic is seeing extreme warmth beyond anything previously recorded at this time of year—prompting alarm from climate scientists around the world. 
""Folks, we're in a climate emergency,"" tweeted meteorologist Eric Holthaus. Yeah, this isn't normal. Follow @ZLabe @Weather_West @Climatologist49 for more. Folks, we're in a climate emergency. Tell everyone you know. pic.twitter.com/BKuD7H4qfD 
— Eric Holthaus (@EricHolthaus) November 17, 2016 
The temperature at the North Pole as of Thursday was a stunning 36ºF (20°C) above normal. 
The bizarre heat is fueling the rapid melt of the pole's ice caps, and it is particularly unusual because it's all happening during the polar night—the time of year when the North Pole never sees the sun, observed UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain: Despite onset of #PolarNight , temperatures near #NorthPole increasing. Extraordinary situation right now in #Arctic , w/record low #seaice . pic.twitter.com/zpS8hDK2nG 
— Daniel Swain (@Weather_West) November 16, 2016 
Other meteorologists on Twitter highlighted the abnormality of the situation: Today's latest #Arctic mean temperature continues to move the wrong direction… up. Quite an anomalous spike! pic.twitter.com/C93cQWUKV9 
— Zack Labe (@ZLabe) November 15, 2016 
The cause? According to the Washington Post , it's the result of an elongated jet stream propelling hot air farther north than normal—which is caused by climate change. 
""The Arctic warmth is the result of a combination of record-low sea-ice extent for this time of year, probably very thin ice, and plenty of warm/moist air from lower latitudes being driven northward by a very wavy jet stream,"" Jennifer Francis, an Arctic specialist at Rutgers University, told the Post . 
The Washington Post continued: 
Francis has published research suggesting that the jet stream, which travels from west to east across the Northern Hemisphere in the mid-latitudes, is becoming more wavy and elongated as the Arctic warms faster than the equator does. 
""It will be fascinating to see if the stratospheric polar vortex continues to be as weak as it is now, which favors a negative Arctic Oscillation and probably a cold mid/late winter to continue over central and eastern Asia and eastern North America. The extreme behavior of the Arctic in 2016 seems to be in no hurry to quit,"" Francis continued. 
Another culprit is that areas of open ocean water are showing unusually hot surface temperatures, according to Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Center, who was quoted by environmental writer Hannah Waters on Twitter. 
Serreze commented to the Washington Post : ""There are some areas in the Arctic Ocean that are as much as 25 degrees Fahrenheit above average now. It's pretty crazy."" 
The alarming Arctic weather happens during the United Nations climate conference in Morocco , and as environmentalists and climate scientists in the U.S. grapple with the prospect of a president-elect who denies the existence of climate change. Things are indeed not looking good for the planet, experts warn .",0

[Tidal will become available to 45 million Sprint customers as part of the deal, according to Billboard, while the new partnership also “includes the creation of a ‘dedicated marketing fund,’ which a source says will have an annual budget of $75 million solely for the artist initiatives and exclusives. ”  “Jay saw not only a business need, but a cultural one, and put his heart and grit into building TIDAL into a   music streaming platform that is unrivaled in quality and content,” said Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, who has now joined Tidal’s board of directors. “The passion and dedication that these   bring to fans will enable Sprint to offer new and existing customers access to exclusive content and entertainment experiences in a way no other service can. ” “Sprint shares our view of revolutionizing the creative industry to allow artists to connect directly with their fans and reach their fullest, shared potential,” added Jay Z in a statement. “Marcelo understood our goal right away and together we are excited to bring Sprint’s 45 million customers an unmatched entertainment experience. ” Despite boasting exclusive albums from a variety of artists including Beyonce, Kanye West, and Rihanna, Tidal lost $28 million in 2015.

22544,Obama’s Call For Censorship Reveals The Media Has Lost Control Of Americans (VIDEO),"Date: October 29, 2016 By: Wayne Thomas, Nation One News | In a White House invitation only event, “Science” conference. Barack Obama went off topic to discuss the Media. Specifically, what he called the “magazines you get at the grocery store”. He characterized this kind of media as a problem. His comments came following a lengthy conference with a room full of Obama’s scientific elite. So of course, his comments were well received by the audience. It is not hard to interpret what Obama is talking about. He is talking about papers like ours. We are not controlled by anyone except our own conscience. We use titles that encourage people to read our content. But, you won’t find us in the Grocery store. No, you will find us everywhere else. We check our facts and all too often they don’t agree with what the mainstream media wants you to believe! He begins by saying: “We are going to have to rebuild, within this wild, wild west of information flow; some sort of curating function” You will notice he explains how the media was once easy to control when he says: “It used to be there were three television stations, and Walter Cronkite was there” He goes on in an attempt to bundle everyone who disagrees with them into the same group as conspiracy theorists by saying: there were always those WHO didn’t agree, and [chuckle THEY] didn’t believe we landed on the moon or that Elvis is dead. He makes a striking admission when he says: It wasn’t always as democratic as it should have been. He closes his idea by saying: There has to be some for of way we can sort through information that passes some sort of truthyness test. I don’t need to remind you that Barrack Obama is speaking to a room full of hundreds of very influential people. These include teachers, scientists, and even politicians. Barack Obama just instructed that community to find a way to Censor Free Press without calling it “Censoring the FREE PRESS.” Within days of his statements, we see the Establishment Media targeting small sites and up and coming news sources such as Breitbart. We wrote a story about this earlier today. There have also been hundreds of reports of censorship by Facebook, which we will report on in the coming days. Barack Obama never mentioned Donald Trump, but one has to wonder why now? Why now, after forty years of the unmolested free press does the Establishment want to Censor it? The answer is right in front of you , after all, look at what you are reading, and who published it. We are not ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, or FOX.

A week earlier, the queen, who is 90, missed a Christmas Day church service, for the first time since 1988, because of the illness. “The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold,” the palace said in a statement. The queen’s husband, Prince Philip, who had also been ill, was well enough to attend both services, in the church at Sandringham, which is in Norfolk, on the east coast of England.

“We toyed with various ideas,” said a Channel 4 executive, “including Celebrity Gogglebox. Though obviously, we don’t mean actual celebrities – just people who’ve been in an earlier series of Gogglebox. That counts, right? 
“Then someone suggested I’m a Sentient Life-Form, Get Me Out Of Here, in which we’d watch people realising there’s more to life than watching TV. And someone else suggested we just film ourselves struggling to squeeze ever more mileage out of what was a lame idea to begin with.

22556,Obama Urges Community Organizing in Response to Donald Trump,"Former President Barack Obama issued a statement reacting to President Donald Trump’s executive order to restrict immigration from   countries in the Middle East, urging Americans to organize against the president. [“President Barack Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,” Obama’s spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement to reporters.  Through his spokesman, Obama also opposed discrimination against people because of their faith or religion, although he did not say that Trump’s actions did so. “With regard to comparisons to President Obama’s foreign policy decisions, as we’ve heard before,” Lewis said. “The president fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion. ” Lewis recalled the former president’s final speech as president, urging Americans to “be the guardians of our democracy. ” “Citizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize, and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake,” the statement read. In November 2016, Obama was asked whether he would criticize his successor if he disagreed with him, imitating former President George W. Bush for remaining silent. “I want to be respectful of the office and give the   an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance,” Obama said during a press conference in Peru. But Obama specified that he would reserve the right to speak out, if he felt that Trump was affecting core American ideals. “[I]f I think that it’s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I’ll examine it when it comes,” he said.",0
22557,Syrian Kurds Warn US: Turkey Can’t Be Involved in Raqqa Invasion,"Insists SDF the 'Only Force' That Will Invade the ISIS Capital by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This 
A new statement from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a faction which is dominated by the Kurdish YPG, has affirmed that not only will they be participating in the invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, as previously announced by the US, but that they intend to be the “ only force that will take part in the operation .” 
Even more noteworthy, since the Turkish government has over the past two months repeatedly publicly warned the US that the Kurds mustn’t be allowed to participate in the Raqqa operation at all, the SDF’s statement offered its own warning to the US that Turkey can’t have any role. 
Turkey’s military and its allied rebel factions have been invading northern Syria for some time now, mostly fighting ISIS as well, but Turkish warplanes have repeatedly attacked Kurdish YPG forces as well, mostly notably a few weeks ago when they launched strikes against YPG forces who were engaged in an offensive against ISIS at the time. 
It is unsurprising, then, that neither side is comfortable working with the other in offensives, but still raises the possibility of the two getting into direct combat over who gets to attack Raqqa. This is particularly true since Turkey is still resenting their exclusion from Iraq’s invasion of Mosul. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
22558,Judicial Watch: Susan Rice ’Unmasking’ Documents Moved From NSC to Obama Library,"The National Security Council cannot hand over records relating to former National Security Adviser Susan Rice’s surveillance of Americans, because they have been moved to the Obama presidential library and may be sealed for as many as five years, conservative watchdog Judicial Watch announced Monday. [The NSC informed Judicial Watch in a letter dated May 23 that materials related to Rice’s requests to know the identities of Americans swept up in surveillance of foreign targets, including any Trump campaign or transition officials, have been moved to the library.  The NSC’s Director of Access Management John Powers said in the letter: Documents from the Obama administration have been transferred to the Barack Obama Presidential Library. You may send your request to the Obama Library. However, you should be aware that under the Presidential Records Act, Presidential records remain closed to the public for five years after an administration has left office. Judicial Watch earlier this year filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for those documents, including of communications between Rice and any intelligence community member or agency regarding any Russian involvement in the 2016 elections, the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers, or any suspected communications between Russia and Trump officials. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said the group will seek to find out when the records were moved, and warned of legal actions. He said: Prosecutors, Congress, and the public will want to know when the National Security Council shipped off the records about potential intelligence abuses by the Susan Rice and others in the Obama White House to the memory hole of the Obama Presidential Library. We are considering our legal options but we hope that the Special Counsel and Congress also consider their options and get these records. In April, blogger Mike Cernovich, Bloomberg, and Fox News revealed that Rice had requested to “unmask”  —   or unveil the hidden names of  —   Trump transition officials who were caught up in surveillance of foreign targets. Typically, in surveillance of foreign targets’ communications, U. S. citizens mentioned or participating in them would have their names “masked,” or hidden, due to ethical, legal, and privacy concerns. However, government consumers of the intelligence can request to have their names unmasked if it is important to understanding the communications. According to Cernovich, The White House Counsel’s office identified Rice as the person who had requested the unmasking, after examining her log requests, Cernovich reported on April 2. Bloomberg and Fox News would later corroborate the report. The revelation lent credence to Trump’s assertion that the Obama administration had been surveilling his transition team. The Wall Street Journal editorial board has argued Rice had no reason to request the unmaskings. Since then, the House intelligence committee has also subpoenaed the intelligence community for information on unmasking requests by Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan, and U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power. The misuse of unmasking came under media scrutiny after U. S. officials illegally leaked to the Washington Post a private conversation between former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak on December 24. Flynn resigned after those communications, not because anything inappropriate was found, but because he had misrepresented those communications to Vice President Mike Pence.

22560,New York Times Sides with Leftist Mob at Evergreen College - Breitbart,"The New York Times offered a revisionist history of the ongoing crisis at Evergreen State College in Washington on Saturday, ignoring   violence and smearing liberal professor Bret Weinstein (above) who is a victim of the chaos. [The Times‘ Anemona Hartocollis reported that the college “had to hold its commencement 30 miles from campus, at a rented baseball stadium where everyone had to pass through metal detectors. ”  Her explanation of why that came to pass suggests conservative media are to blame for stirring up threats from outside the campus, and totally ignores the violent role of   activists on campus, some of whom have been “patrolling” campus with baseball bats. She ignored critical details in the story, such as the fact that campus police told Weinstein they could not protect him. Hartocollis also sided with critics of professor Weinstein, who supported black students’ efforts to draw attention to racial issues but refused to obey when they told white professors and students not to come to campus. She quoted a professor who is angry that he shared his dispute with the outside press: “That he took this public I just feel like is a breach of trust. ” Hartocollis also suggested Weinstein is acting out of greed, noting that he has a “new blog offering his subscribers insights into ‘evolution, civilization and intolerance‘ for a nominal monthly fee” [original link]. Moreover, she did not quote any of Weinstein’s supporters, but supplied a quote from a parent whose daughter is opposed to him: Ellis Paguirigan, a 1991 Evergreen graduate whose daughter, Melia, was graduating and planned to go into ocean conservation, said they were both disappointed in Professor Weinstein’s stance. Melia had Professor Weinstein in her freshman year and liked his class, Mr. Paguirigan said. But, he added, “my daughter is a person of color  —   she kind of takes it personal. ” The implication is that Weinstein is racist  —   exactly the false charge lobbed by the campus mob. The Times has featured at least one   criticizing the left’s behavior at Evergreen. However, its news coverage of the latest developments is a sign of where the paper’s true sympathies lie. Joel B.

22562,Trump’s A Wrench In The Works To The NWO Timetable for Global Control,"Leave a reply 
Katie Gallanti – Some say that the nation is divided. However as you can see, the nation is very united – and it is not united in a “republican way”, but in an anti-globalist and anti-corruption way. The people have decided that business as usual will not go on. 
If Hillary Clinton had won, TPP would have been enacted lickety split. Obamacare, which is a financial nightmare for many middle class and working class families, as well as the doorway for the elites control over your health (microchipping, vaccinations) would have stayed in place. Many of the policies that have, by design, been implemented to weaken the USA, so that it was more easily absorbed into a future one world government, would have been enacted. George Soros, and all the tentacles of the satanic cabal would have continued undisturbed with their plans. 
I know that many are not convinced that The Donald is sincere, but we know for a fact that HRC was not sincere. With this outcome there is at least the possibility of a new opening. 
This is also the only election outcome that delays and pulls the USA from the implementation of the NWO timetable. And there was a reason for this timetable, as they are working against the rapidly approaching collective shift in consciousness and the galactic clock. There will a point, soon, where the dark forces will no longer be able to anchor here, and they know it. When we clearly understand the energetic of this planet and the ways in which energy grids (both light and dark) have operated and still function, the timing issue becomes 100% clear. I feel that The Donald pulls in a direction distant enough from their plans, to set them back in their timeline considerably. And this is very good news. 
So at the very least we now have a delay of that clock, and in my view a delay that is sufficient to derail their plans to a degree that their plans may indeed, eventually, flop for good. 
On an energetic level also note, that regardless of The Donald, this was a vote of humanity that said “Screw you dark cabal. Screw you George Soros. Screw you FBI that does not do its job. Screw you voter fraud and Podesta emails. Screw you manipulative dark powers” And the collective energy reacts to that vote by anchoring the reality that we choose of our free will. Even if The Donald turns out to be a Jesuit fake, this collective energetic stance will go a long way. Also it is my sense that the awakened sleeping giant that The Untamed We The People has become, is not about to go back to sleep any time soon. If The Donald gets up to no good, he will soon be replaced. 
So here we are. We are moving steadily away from the elite plans into a world that we, now, have the responsibility to create. And this is the first step in that direction for the USA.

22567,Iranian President Rouhani Claims Terrorists in Syria ‘Celebrating’ Trump’s Air Strikes - Breitbart,"(AFP)  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that “terrorists” were applauding his US counterpart Donald Trump for launching a missile strike on an airbase of his Syrian government ally. [But he backed calls for an independent inquiry into a suspected chemical weapons attack on a   town in northwestern Syria on Tuesday that Trump blamed on the Damascus regime.  “This man who is now in office in America claimed that he wanted to fight terrorism but today all terrorists in Syria are celebrating the US attack,” Rouhani said in a speech aired by state television. “Why have you attacked the Syrian army which is at war with terrorists? Under what law or authority did you launch your missiles at this independent country?” Iran and Russia are the closest allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad. They have provided him with military support not only against jihadists like the Islamic State group and former   affiliate Fateh   Front that are targeted by a   coalition but also against other rebels they deem “terrorists” too. Both governments have defended their Damascus ally against Western allegations that it carried out a chemical weapons attack on the   town of Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday, killing dozens of civilians. Rouhani called for “an independent commission” by “impartial countries” into the claims. “According to the United Nations, the Syrian government does not possess chemical weapons,” he said. Rouhani was referring to the   destruction of the Damascus regime’s chemical arsenal under a 2013 agreement between Washington and Moscow. On Friday, hours after the US missile strike, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the Western allegations were “bogus. ” He likened them to the claims that Saddam Hussein’s regime had weapons of mass destruction which premised the   invasion of Iraq in 2003 but which later turned out to be baseless.",0

EXPERTS have stressed that of course America is genuinely stupid enough to elect a deranged murder clown as its president. 
Professor Henry Brubaker, from the Institute for Studies, said: “The question ‘are Americans really stupid enough to do this?’ is, in itself, fairly idiotic. 
“In recent years, thanks to some very well made television programmes like Breaking Bad and House of Cards , we may have led ourselves to believe that America is more intelligent than it actually is. 
“More than half the population believes in some form of creationism. More. Than. Half. 
“Meanwhile, many of them are unable to locate their own state on a map, never mind large, well known foreign countries.

22576,"Illegal Thug Returns After Deported Twice, Gives Sick ‘Gift’ To Girlfriend","Share This 
Our nation is out of control, and perhaps the biggest threat is our lax border policy, courtesy of Barack Obama. Proving just that is an illegal alien who managed to sneak his way back into this country after being deported twice. However, it’s the sick surprise he had for his girlfriend that landed him behind bars – and hopefully, it’s for good. 
It all started when the daughter of illegal alien Raul Perez, 43, got an odd phone call from her father that just couldn’t be ignored. After hanging up with her father, Perez’s daughter immediately called 911, prompting dispatch to send a few officers to the home of the girl’s mother, 31-year-old Karla Guadalupe-Magana, a mother of 5 and Perez’s girlfriend. Raul Perez (left), Karla Guadalupe-Magana (right) (Source: Mail Online ) 
Unfortunately, the situation would take a horrid turn as officers made their way into the home to find the woman dead on the bathroom floor with Perez asleep in the bed just feet away. Come to find out, the illegal alien decided to strangle her to death for reasons unknown – but it only gets worse from there . 
According to reports, Perez is actually a Mexico national in the United States illegally and had already been deported twice, but making matters worse, he was actually in police custody just 4 days prior to the murder. Unfortunately, he was released on bond due to a technicality. 
Perez had been arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, but he reportedly used a fake name to fly under the radar. Although his fingerprints were taken and sent to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), seeing how the agency “ doesn’t monitor this type of thing 24/7 ,” Perez was released on bond before the local jail heard anything back. 
Right now, Perez is facing life in prison and deportation once he has answered for his crimes – not that it really does any good. As it stands, this illegal alien could live the rest of his life, leeching off the American taxpayer while in our prison system, because our border is so porous that he just walked across three separate times. If he’s deported, that would solve the drain on our taxpayers, but as he’s already proven, it also means he could do it all again if our border issue isn’t solved. 
This is the type of problem that America is dealing with, and it all stems from Barack Obama’s presidency and the man’s dangerous policies. Beyond tying Border Patrol’s hands behind their backs, our so-called leader has left our nation’s border literally open for anyone to simply walk across. 
Unfortunately, because of that lunacy, a mother of 5 is now dead. However, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel if Donald Trump gets elected. Not only will he allow Border Patrol to do its job, he’ll build a wall, making it just about impossible for scum like Perez to come into this country – and that, my friends, is exactly what we need.",0

22588,Trump Fires Back at ’No-Talent’ Stephen Colbert: ’His Show Was Dying’ Before He Started Attacking Me,"President Donald Trump fired back at Stephen Colbert in an interview this week following the Late Show host’s   attacks on him during a segment on his show this month. [In an interview with Time magazine published Thursday, the    took on Colbert, who told a series of crude jokes about Trump during last week’s Monday broadcast that culminated in the host calling Trump’s mouth a “c*ck holster” for Russian President Vladimir Putin.  “You see a   guy like Colbert. There’s nothing funny about what he says,” Trump told Time. “And what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. ” In his opening monologue last Monday, the CBS funnyman said, “The only thing [Trump’s] mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin’s c*ck holster. ” The joke was panned as homophobic and drew outrage from fans, who quickly made the hashtag #FireColbert a trending topic on Twitter. Colbert addressed the controversy surrounding the joke on his show two days later and said he didn’t regret attacking the president. In his remarks to media Thursday, Trump said Colbert’s crude comments “only builds up my base. ” “It only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better,” Trump added. “But his show was dying. I’ve done his show.   …     But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated  …     The highest rating he’s ever had. ” Indeed, Colbert’s   show has seen a ratings resurgence since Trump took office. The president also took aim at a number of mainstream media personalities. Trump told Time that CNN host Chris Cuomo looks like a “chained lunatic” on TV and said CNN’s Don Lemon is “perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting. ” “Chris Cuomo, he’s sitting there like a chained lunatic. He’s like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way,” Trump said. “This Don Lemon who’s perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it’s like  —   sometimes they’ll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they’ll start screaming, we’re going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember?” “Washington Post, New York Times, they’re really, really dishonest,” Trump continued before lashing out at Time reporters. “You people are quite dishonest in all fairness. ” Trump also said he said he no longer tunes in to watch MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who has repeatedly ripped the president and his administration. The president called Fox News the “most accurate” news network and says he tunes in to watch the morning programming. “I do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I’m watching Fox. But they’re pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it,” he said. “I don’t mean they  —   if I do something wrong.

According to WikiLeaks emails published Monday, Hillary Clinton’s staff knew that Anthony Weiner was messaging an underage girl as far back as 2011, yet did nothing about it. The protection of young women isn’t high on the list of priorities when you work for the Democratic nominee. 
RedStateWatcher reported that the email detailed lurid claims of private messages to an underage girl being investigated by police – and was met with the response ‘oof’ by Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. 
“Police on Friday afternoon came to the home of a 17-year-old high school junior to ask her about direct online communications she has had with Rep. Anthony Weiner,” the email read. 
“Two officers from the New Castle County Police Department arrived at the girl’s home around 4:30 p.m. and asked to speak with the girl’s mother about the daughter’s contact with Weiner. Another officer appeared at the home a short time later.” 
Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, Hillary’s top aide.

Since then, the disgraced former Congressman hasn’t been able to kick the habit. (Most recently, he was caught sending suggestive photos of himself to a mistress. His son was asleep in the background of one infamous shot.)

22597,5 Reasons You Should Be Striking Right Now,"0 Add Comment 
YOU may be considering joining the ranks of the gardaí, teachers, nurses, doctors, bus drivers, stamp lickers, door holding openers, jar openers, cat flap installers, milk men, hat wearers and human taxidermists and commencing strike action some time soon. And WWN is here to tell you that’s exactly what you should be doing! 
We have a list of 5 reasons you should be withdrawing your labour until the government or your employers give in to your demands. 
1) Just think of all the cool shit you could be buying 
With that little extra bit of cash, you could buy a giant inflatable kangaroo. It would be a terrible waste of money and you’d regret it, but if you went on strike and secured some extra wonga this is the kind of shit you could do. Paying off debt, plugging holes in your pension and savings, feeding your family…could be a whole lot more fun with a giant inflatable kangaroo! 
2) Everybody’s doing it 
Come on, you don’t want to miss out, do you? Cool people don’t miss out, you’re a cool person, right? If you’re not part of a union or even if you’re happy with your pay and working conditions, a day off or two could be fun. Shouting while holding signs up is actually quite therapeutic too. 
3) You don’t want to miss out 
Remember, back in the Celtic Tiger days, right at the end of it all when all manner of people were being blamed and vilified for contributing to the downfall of an economy and nation? You don’t want to miss out on being part of that for the first time or for nostalgia’s sake if you’ve done it before, being part of something big is a really fulfilling experience. 
4) Did we mention sweet, cold hard cash? 
While no one can estimate just exactly how many days you will have to strike for, but trust when we say after 6,7 or 8 years of cuts and increases in the cost of living you’ll be right on track to earning almost as much as you once did. Result! 
Oh, you’re a TD 
Right, yeah, got ya. Loud and clear. Sure, why would you strike? You get a pay rise even though you didn’t even ask for one. No, fair play, you lot have it sussed. Our bad.",0

22604,"How Liberal Politics, Including Obamacare, Hurt ESPN - Breitbart","The fallout over ESPN’s wave of mass layoffs continues to reverberate across sports media, with many trying to assess just why it happened. There are a lot of reasons, granted, but liberal politics is most assuredly one of them. [For many years, fans who want the network to “stick to sports” have accused cable sports network ESPN of infusing   politics into its sports coverage, and many feel that the loss of millions of subscribers is due to the network’s refusal to tell its   hosts and reporters to cool it on their blatant liberal bias. But, liberal politics has caused ESPN trouble in other ways, too.  In another article assessing the things that led to ESPN’s latest mass firing, E. J. Hill of TheFederalist. com notes that liberal politics in the form of government policy and regulation also hurt ESPN. Aside from the arcane regulations of the cable TV industry, Hill notes that Obamacare had a major, negative impact on ESPN. Hill reports that ESPN had changed its policy for employees when Obamacare became law. Obama’s health care takeover forced ESPN to turn away from its heavy use of freelancers. After Obamacare was implemented, “the Obama administration put employers like ESPN with high numbers of 1099 workers  …     on notice,” Hill wrote. “Hire [employees] with benefits and withhold federal taxes, or face massive fines for the misclassification of workers. ” The new law forced ESPN into unwanted union contracts. Consequently, ESPN hired just enough workers to keep them up and running and in return forced thousands of freelancers into NABET (National Association of Broadcast Engineers and Technicians) under that union’s work agreement with ABC. Not only would the network’s tax bill soar, but they also had to stem the pressure from the demands of Obamacare. Additionally, ESPN was forced to offer payments to the Entertainment Industry Flex Plan for each day worked by their newly unionized workforce. This raised ESPN’s labor costs tremendously. Because of this, Hill said, ESPN ended up initiating mass firings in 2013, 2015, and just this month because the new Obamacare rules caused the network’s salary costs to explode. This meant sacrificing production aspects, which compromised the quality of the telecast. Hill added that a changing TV landscape, such as increased competition and negotiations for payment, also hurt ESPN’s once lucrative business model. But, his point about how detrimental Obamacare has been for ESPN is not just a sports news problem, it is a problem hurting businesses all across the board and in every corner of the nation. So, in the end, liberalism has been far more troublesome to ESPN than just as an irritant on the air. It has also hurt the network behind the scenes.

22605,"Amid Divisions in U.K. Over ‘Brexit,’ Nicola Sturgeon Calls for New Referendum on Scottish Independence - The New York Times","LONDON  —   Protesting Britain’s plans to leave the European Union, Scotland’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, called on Monday for a referendum on Scottish independence as early as next year. The announcement was not unexpected, but it reflected the stark divisions in Britain as the government prepares to start the official process to exit the   bloc. Citing the fact that most Scottish voters had opposed a British exit in last year’s referendum  —   62 percent voted in favor of staying in the European Union, compared with 48 percent in Britain over all  —   Ms. Sturgeon said that London had failed to address Scotland’s desire to remain in the single market after Britain leaves. “Not only is there no U. K.  agreement on the way ahead, but the U. K. government has not moved even an inch in pursuit of compromise and agreement,” Ms. Sturgeon said in a speech in Edinburgh. “Our efforts at compromise have instead been met with a brick wall of intransigence. ” Scotland rejected independence from Britain in a closely watched vote in September 2014, and public opinion on the issue remains deeply divided. For Scotland to hold another legally binding referendum, the British Parliament would have to give its approval, as would the Scottish Parliament. Ms. Sturgeon’s comments came hours before the British Parliament was expected to clear the way for Prime Minister Theresa May to invoke Article 50, the formal procedure that sets off a   negotiation with the 27 other member states of the European Union. Ms. Sturgeon said her preferred time frame for a new vote would be in the autumn of 2018 or the spring of 2019, when the terms of a British exit from the bloc would be clearer. She said she would ask Scotland’s devolved legislature in Edinburgh to request approval from the British Parliament for the new referendum, known as a Section 30 order, next week. Mrs. May has accused Ms. Sturgeon and her Scottish National Party, which dominates politics in Scotland, of having an “obsession” with independence. But officials say it would be politically difficult for Mrs. May to refuse a new referendum outright. The prime minister’s office said in a statement on Monday that it had been “working closely” with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, “recognizing the many areas of common ground” on issues like fighting terrorism and protecting workers’ rights. “The evidence clearly shows that a majority of people in Scotland do not want a second independence referendum,” the statement said. “Another referendum would be divisive and cause huge economic uncertainty at the worst possible time. The Scottish government should focus on delivering good government and public services for the people in Scotland. ” Ms. Sturgeon’s party won the 2015 election in Scotland on a manifesto that left open the door for another independence referendum should circumstances “materially change,” and she had cited a   Brexit  —   then considered highly unlikely  —   as an example of such a change. The real fight might be over timing: London, officials say, would prefer that Scotland put off another vote until after Britain has left the European Union, betting that voters will feel less confident about leaving once they have been pulled out of the bloc. Ms. Sturgeon emphasized that Scotland should not be withdrawn from Europe against the will of its people. She also pointed to the weakness of the opposition Labour Party, citing predictions of a Conservative Party government in London “until 2030 or beyond. ” Since the June referendum on Britain’s future in Europe, Ms. Sturgeon has argued that Scotland should be given a special status. So far, Mrs. May has ruled out any concessions. On Monday, Ms. Sturgeon said there could be room for compromise if the prime minister were to offer a deal for Scotland, but she noted that no options had yet been offered.",0

WHAT lessons should Europe draw from Donald Trump’s election victory? For those Europeans who believe in American exceptionalism, there may be little to learn.

Moreover, the electoral college is a peculiar institution. Hillary Clinton seems to have won the popular vote, after all. 
But for most European politicians the shock of the American election was compounded by the obvious parallels for their own democracies. Worried leaders tempered their letters of congratulation to Mr Trump with veiled reminders of the transatlantic values many of them believe his victory imperils.

That follows reports that the musicians sent out invitations to the Turkish President and his top aides. 
The concert, run by the renowned Dresden Symphony Orchestra, was scheduled to take place on November 13 in the German consulate in Istanbul. Read more German parliament acknowledges Armenian genocide amid intense Turkish pressure 
Called ‘Aghet’ or ‘catastrophe’ in Armenian, the performance was to commemorate the victims of the 1915 massacre that left around 1.5 million Armenians dead and hundreds of thousands forced to flee. 
Turkish President Recep Erdogan was personally invited to attend the event by the orchestra, along with other top Turkish politicians, including Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu, German T-Online news outlet reports , citing DPA news agency, which gained access to copies of the invitations. 
The invitations were made despite Erdogan taking a hard stance against Germany’s recognition of the Armenian genocide – even threatening Germany with some “response measures.” 
The concert was cancelled by Berlin. On Wednesday, the German Foreign Office said that “the premises in the Istanbul consulate are not available on November 13th,” according to Deutsche Welle. 
Later in the day, orchestra director Markus Rindt said he received notification from the ministry with nearly the same content. 
“It’s definitely been canceled. They said they wanted to reschedule at a better time, but when would that be? This has been planned for years,” Rindt told Reuters. 
The piece by the Dresden Symphony Orchestra includes musicians from Turkey, Armenia, Germany, and the former Yugoslavia. It premiered last year in Berlin with additional performances scheduled in Belgrade on November 5 and in the Armenian capital of Yerevan on November 10. Read more Germany says Armenia genocide resolution ‘non-binding’ after reports Berlin keen to ‘satisfy’ Turkey 
The ‘Aghet’ has become one of several stumbling blocks in troubled Turkey-Germany relations. In April, the Turkish ambassador to the EU demanded that the bloc stop funding the project which received initial support from the European Commission’s Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture. 
On June 2, 2016, the German parliament almost unanimously passed a symbolic resolution recognizing the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces as ‘genocide.’ The move was praised by Armenia and sharply criticized by Turkey, which even tried to pressure Germany ahead of the vote. 
Following the move, Ankara recalled its ambassador to Germany, while Erdogan said that the government would discuss response measures. 
The mass killings began on April 24, 1915, when 250 Armenian intellectuals were detained by Ottoman authorities and later executed in Constantinople, present-day Istanbul. Most of the Ottoman Empire’s Armenians were then displaced, deported, or placed in concentration camps on the pretext of rebelling and siding with Russia in World War I. Up to 1.5 million Armenians were affected by these measures. 
Turkey, the successor of the Ottoman Empire, concedes that many Armenians were mistreated at the time, but maintains that the number of victims has been grossly exaggerated.",0

Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 28, 2016 
You’ve seen Pakistanis demand better internet connections, you’ve seen Afghanis demand bigger TVs, you’ve seen North Africans demand better and more hookers – now witness Black Africans demand designer clothing. 
These videos of helpless “asylum seekers” demanding luxury goods and services will never, ever get old. 
Il Giornale : 
When they get “standard” cloths from Caritas or the asylum seeker reception system it makes them unhappy because they are not designer clothes. They want Armani or Boss clothes, or perhaps also Pirelli shoes. 
This was revealed by the president of the Sar.ha Cooperative. He has been hosting migrants at the Hotel Byron in Malcontenta (Venice region). In recent days a controversy broke out about the coop’s decision to put padlocks on the windows to prevent migrants escaping during the night. The immigrants protested in the street, also against the food which they considered to be not good. Apparently there was also something else behind it. The migrants are demanding brand-name clothes, from high-fashion designer labels. Not normal jeans: they want Armani or Boss. 
“Unfortunately they come to Italy with the asylum reception systems of northern Europe as a model,” saod Lorenzo Chinellato, presidente of the Sar.ha cooperative Sar.ha, “when they arrived we gave them clothes, standard clothes. They want brand-name clothes, Armani and Boss, they asked for Pirellli shoes. These are their models. When they came to us, they didn’t have clothes, but they all had smartphones”. 
Translation via Diversity Macht Frei . 
In the video you can also hear the standard complaints about the food only being “pasta and rice,” with one colored person actually complaining about how there are too many refugees. 
Just as all women literally believe that all men exist to serve their personal needs, all colored people believe Whites exist for the sole purpose of giving them free everything. And not just any free everything – the highest quality of free everything. 
But whereas it is perfectly natural for women to believe that men exist only to serve them, as this is a part of their hardwired psychology (as well as in some simple way absolutely true – the primary male purpose in life is to protect and raise off-spring and women have to be taken care of in order to make this happen), these colored people have developed this attitude based on our pandering to them, bowing down to them, treating them as superior beings. We have presented ourselves as existing only to serve them, and they have taken us at our word.",0
22622,MYSTERY: Are Hillary Clinton’s eye problems becoming more frequent?,"American Mirror October 27, 2016 
For at least the second time in the last several days, cameras captured Hillary Clinton’s eyes acting strangely. 
The behavior, which doctors have told The American Mirror appears to be “disconjugate gaze” — a common symptom of increased intracranial pressure, or swelling of the brain — was evident again during a rally on Wednesday in Lake Worth, Florida. 
Here are several more of the instances from today: 
Despite getting major coverage on The Drudge Report, no mainstream news outlet has covered the apparent issue with Clinton’s eyes. 
But the several instances over the last few weeks, and as recently as last Friday , have been enough for doctors to publicly call on Clinton to undergo a full medical example and release the results. 
“My rational self would say that they could have defused all this a long time ago by releasing her medical records and having her undergo the same type of neurologic exam that every high school football player in America who ‘gets his bell rung’ on Friday night must undergo before he can suit up for the game next Friday,” Dr. John R. Coppedge, a surgical specialist from Texas, told The American Mirror . A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
“She needs a full neurology evaluation, neuro-opthalmology evaluation, MRI, cerebral venography and a lumbar puncture,” Dr. Gerald Gianoli, an expert in intracranial pressure, said to this news site. 
“It is possible that her status could be significantly improved. But at the same time, she risks demonstrating to the public that her medical problems are more serious than she has let on in the past.” 
Gianoli, who believes the condition could be the result of elevated pressure, which can cause other problems. 
“It can lead to blindness, deafness, progressive vertigo/balance problems, seizures/stroke and continued problems with concentration, memory and ability to mentally focus,” he said. 
“It could also lead to death if the lateral sinus thrombosis were to progress to include the opposite side.” This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:57 am Share this article",0
22626,Straight Couple Lose Court Battle to Enter Into Civil Partnership,"A heterosexual couple have lost their legal battle to enter into a civil partnership. [Academics Rebecca Steinfeld, 35, and Charles Keidan, 40, wanted to secure legal recognition of their   relationship by entering into a civil partnership, rejecting marriage as they claim it carries “patriarchal baggage”. However, they have been prevented from doing so because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 stipulates that only   couples are eligible.  In November the couple, who have a    daughter, challenged a decision by High Court judge Mrs Justice Andrews to dismiss their judicial review action. But on Tuesday their challenge was in turn dismissed by the Court of Appeal, the Telegraph has reported. Addressing Lady Justice Arden, Lord Justice Beatson and Lord Justice Briggs, Karon Monaghan QC advanced the argument that barring the couple from entering into a civil partnership was incompatible with Article 14 of the European Convention, which relates to discrimination, taken with Article 8, which refers to respect for private and family life. “They wish very much  —   and it is of very considerable importance to them  —   to enter into a legally regulated relationship which does not carry with it patriarchal baggage, which many consider comes with the institution of marriage,” she said. Dan Squires QC, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, who has responsibility for equalities within Government, told the court that a decision had been taken within Government to see how legislation extending marriage for   couples planned out before offering civil partnerships up to heterosexual couples. The judges agreed with the couple that a potential violation of Article 14, taken with Article 8, had been identified, but Lady Justice Arden dissented on the question of whether the Government’s current “wait and see” policy was justified. Ms Steinfeld said: “We are pleased that today’s ruling has shown that the Government must act very soon to end this unfair situation. “All three judges agreed that we’re being treated differently because of our sexual orientation, and that this impacts our private and family life. “All three rejected the argument that we could ‘just get married’. All three emphasised that the Government cannot maintain the status quo for much longer  —   they are on borrowed time. ” Lady Justice Arden had accepted their case on almost every point, she added, saying: “We lost on a technicality, that the Government should be allowed a little more time to make a decision. So there’s everything to fight for, and much in the ruling that gives us reason to be positive and keep going. ” Mr Keidan said: “The Court of Appeal has made it clear the status quo cannot continue. The Government should now recognise the benefits of opening civil partnerships to   couples. “The measure is fair, popular, good for families and children, and long overdue. They have everything to gain. ”",0
22628,Смерть от скуки,"Происшествия 
На что спорят русские? На что-то возвышенное… Засовывание инородных предметов в анус, например, или употребление залпом литра водки. Как вариант, на прыжок с балкона со второго этажа, или поход в театр в одном исподнем. Но жители острова Сахалин – они другие. С приходом холодов суровый климат оставляет сахалинцам всего несколько опций для развлечений: упиться до положения риз алкоголем и кормить диких медведей печеньем. 
Наша героиня – 54-летняя жительница Охи, естественно, предпочла первое занятие. Две недели женщина, собрав команду собутыльников, занималась беспросветным пьянством. Двое мужчин и трое женщин даже не успевали отлучаться на перекур, так хотелось им выполнить алкогольный план. Даже сон чередовали, чтобы не нарушать интервал приема жизненно-необходимой жидкости. 
После многочасовых споров о различиях барокко и рококо, после цитирования стихов Бунина и Ахматовой, между обсуждением инфляционных процессов и законов мироздания компания заскучала. Тогда хозяин квартиры, где происходило собрание единомышленников, достал из тайника травматический пистолет. 32-летний владелец травмата, который, не родись он на Сахалине, мог бы сделать научное открытие или найти лекарство от алкоголизма, потехи ради начал стрелять из пистолета по стенам. Одна из гостей усомнилась, что из такого оружия можно убить человека. «Да такой железякой и хомячка не прибьёшь!» — пронеслось, вероятно, в одурманенной голове. Так и завязался роковой спор. 
54-летняя дама была уверена, что из травмата убить человека невозможно. В доказательство своей правоты она готова была отдать последнее – 3 тысячи рублей. Наличными! Отказаться от подобного спора и столь легкой наживы – грех и для трезвого человека. Пропитанный спиртом мужчина решил продемонстрировать боеспособность оружия, подошел к женщине, приставил пистолет к ее голове и выстрелил. Увы, отдать ему 3 000 гостья не сможет. 
Когда тело погибшей начало загораживать путь в уборную, собутыльники перенесли женщину на балкон. После, не раздумывая, скинули его на улицу. Зловонный запах в интеллигентной квартире ни к чему, знаете ли. На вызов скорой, очевидно, не хватило храбрости, а на реализацию простейших манипуляций по сокрытию тела – ума. Убийство было так неумело спрятано, что даже рядовые полицейские сложили головоломку и задержали преступника. Сколько правохранителям понадобилось времени, чтобы найти тело под балконом, поднять голову вверх и предположить, что женщину могли просто взять и скинуть с балкона, следствие умалчивает. Главное – стрелок задержан. Он уже ранее был судим и его ожидает новый срок. 
Алкоголь приводит к многим бедам. Но смерть из-за нелепого спора – самый глупый способ уйти из жизни.",0
22629,The illuminati card ‘Enough Is Enough’ a harbinger of things to come?,"The illuminati card ‘Enough Is Enough’ a harbinger of things to come? 

For more than two decades the infamous Illuminati Card Game, created in 1994 by Steve Jackson, has been proven to be a remarkably accurate when it comes to the prediction for future events.

Already several worldwide events had their own card prior to the evening happening.

Now The US elections are behind us and Donald Trump has been elected as the next US President, once again there are two cards which really stand out.

Both cards bear a striking resemblance to Donald Trump.

The first card ‘Charismatic Leader’ shows a man speaking to a fanatic crowd with the following text:

The increased power takes immediately effect. 


The second card ‘Enough is Enough’ shows the likeness to Donald Trump with a bullet whizzing by his head with the following text: 
At any time, our snipers lay you in every place. Have a nice day. 


Now that Donald Trump has come so far to become the 45th president, the people in power want him stopped before he causes any more upset to their status quo. It means that he will become a target.

Some of their methods to stop Donald Trump: Sabotage, economic crisis, civil unrest, false flag operations, cyber attacks and if they have no success to stop him then it is quite possible that they play their last card: Assassination.

Very disturbing is also the warning of Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian-born prophet - who died in 1996 aged 85, and who had an alleged prediction success rate of 85 per cent.

She correctly predicted that the 44th President of the United States would be an African-American and this black President (Obama) would be the last US President.

Obama technically remains President until Donald Trump is sworn in on January 20, 2017 but if Baba Vanga’s prediction would be correct again then something will happen with Donald Trump before January 20, 2017 and Barack Obama will serve a third term with all its consequences.

Baba Vanga’s prediction and especially the second card could be a warning for an upcoming assassination attempt against Donald Trump?

22632,"Scientists Leak Evidence That Approve Elon Musk's Theory: The Universe Is A ""Computer"" Simulation","Share on Facebook Physicists say they may have evidence that the universe is a computer simulation. How? They made a computer simulation of the universe. And it looks sort of like us. A long-proposed thought experiment, put forward by both philosophers and popular culture, points out that any civilization of sufficient size and intelligence would eventually create a simulation universe if such a thing were possible. A long-proposed thought experiment, put forward by both philosophers and popular culture, points out that any civilization of sufficient size and intelligence would eventually create a simulation universe if such a thing were possible. And since there would therefore be many more simulations (within simulations, within simulations) than real universes, it is therefore more likely than not that our world is artificial. Now a team of researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany led by Silas Beane say they have evidence this may be true. In a paper named ‘ Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation ’, they point out that current simulations of the universe – which do exist, but which are extremely weak and small – naturally put limits on physical laws. Technology Review explains that “the problem with all simulations is that the laws of physics, which appear continuous, have to be superimposed onto a discrete three dimensional lattice which advances in steps of time.” What that basically means is that by just being a simulation, the computer would put limits on, for instance, the energy that particles can have within the program. These limits would be experienced by those living within the sim – and as it turns out, something which looks just like these limits do in fact exist. For instance, something known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin, or GZK cut off, is an apparent boundary of the energy that cosmic ray particles can have. This is caused by interaction with cosmic background radiation. But Beane and co’s paper argues that the pattern of this rule mirrors what you might expect from a computer simulation . Naturally, at this point the science becomes pretty tricky to wade through – and we would advise you read the paper itself to try and get the full detail of the idea. But the basic impression is an intriguing one. Like a prisoner in a pitch-black cell, we may never be able to see the ‘walls’ of our prison — but through physics we may be able to reach out and touch them.

من الناحية الفنية، وبدلا من اللجوء إلى خادم الكتروني آمن للحكومة الاتحادية، نصًبت وزيرة الخارجية خادما الكترونيا خاصا بها في المنزل، يسمح لها باستخدام الإنترنت دون ترك أي أثر في الخادم العائد للدولة الاتحادية.
قام الفني الخاص بالسيدة كلينتون بتنظيف الخادم قبل وصول عناصر مكتب التحقيقات الفيدرالي، لذلك لم يكن من الممكن معرفة السبب وراء تنصيب هذا الجهاز في منزلها.
في مرحلة أولى، لحَظَ مكتب التحقيقات الفيدرالي أن الخادم الالكتروني الخاص لم يكن خادما آمنا لوزارة الخارجية. لهذا لم ترتكب السيدة كلينتون سوى خطأ أمنيا.
وفي مرحلة ثانية، قام مكتب التحقيقات الفدرالي بالاستيلاء على الكمبيوتر الخاص بعضو الكونغرس السابق انطوني وينر، الزوج السابق للسيدة هوما عابدين، مديرة مكتب هيلاري كلينتون. وتم العثور في ذلك الكمبيوترعلى رسائل بريد الكتروني واردة من وزيرة الخارجية.

أما والدتها، فترأس الجمعية السعودية للنساء الأعضاء في جماعة الأخوان المسلمين، وكانت تعمل مع زوج الرئيس المصري السابق محمد مرسي.
السيدة هوماعابدين ليست العضو الوحيد في إدارة أوباما على صلة مع جماعة الأخوان المسلمين. أبونغو مالك أوباما، الأخ غير الشقيق للرئيس باراك أوباما، هو أيضاً عضو في الجماعة، وأمين صندوق العمل الدعوي للإخوان في السودان.

The audit, released Friday, found thousands of instances where no SSN was found on file. The agency paid $1 billion to 22, 426 representative payees who “did not have an SSN” and had not kept any paper applications supporting an individual’s case to receive benefits on someone else’s behalf, according to the inspector general. “Furthermore, unless it takes corrective action, we estimate SSA will pay about $182. 5 million in benefits, annually, to representative payees who do not have an SSN or paper application supporting their selection,” the inspector general said. The agency also paid $853. 1 million in benefits since 2004 to individuals whom the agency terminated as representative payees. The inspector general said the errors occurred because the agency did not keep paper records of applications or purge terminated employees from the system. Of the audit’s sample of 100 beneficiaries, only six SSN’s were properly recorded. The inspector general also said that illegal aliens had been receiving benefits through the representative payee system. Illegal aliens without SSNs are allowed to receive government benefits if they are representing their minor children.

22644,Rand: AHCA ’First Time’ GOP Has Supported ’Deplorable’ Practice of Subsidizing Insurance Companies - Breitbart,"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Your World,” Senator Rand Paul ( ) argued the revised American Health Care Act is “the first time that Republicans have affirmatively put their stamp of approval on a program where federal money, taxpayer money, is paid to insurance companies. ” He later characterized subsidizing insurance companies as “deplorable. ”  Rand said the House Freedom Caucus “made the bill a lot less bad. ” He added, “But what I’m still concerned with is, this’ll the first time that Republicans have affirmatively put their stamp of approval on a program where federal money, taxpayer money, is paid to insurance companies.   …     And it boggles my mind how that became a Republican idea. ” Rand further stated, “It’s going to take a little bit of work to get me to a yes vote, but I do have an open mind. I mean, there’s not been a louder voice up here for repealing Obamacare. I really want to repeal it. I just don’t want to replace with   or another federal program. The programs they put in place will be there forever. So the refundable tax credit, which is a subsidy by another name, will be there forever. And this  —   these buying  —   these   pools they want to create, Republicans used to hate the idea. They hated the idea when they were called risk corridors, and there were giving money to insurance companies. They were bailouts, when it was a Democrat idea. Now that it’s a Republican idea, they keep sweetening it up. ” He later argued that the bill offers people who won’t get subsidies anymore “Santa  . ” Rand also said, “I want everybody in the individual market to be protected against   conditions, by getting into the group market, and let market forces work. It can work, but the current bill acknowledges that it doesn’t work, and then we just subsidize the insurance companies, which I think is deplorable. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0

Polanski’s film is among a   new titles added to the official Cannes lineup Thursday, including Ruben Ostlund’s The Square, which will vie for the festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or, with four other contenders.

The    director had attempted to return to the United States after decades of living in exile in Europe, where he fled in 1978 after his conviction.

Now police have arrested Clanton on charges of assault with a deadly weapon. Clanton was a professor of philosophy at Diablo Valley College, which is located is Pleasant Hill, California, a short   trip away from UC Berkeley, though he is no longer listed among the school’s professors. “His work in political philosophy also centers on mass incarceration and the prison system,” Clanton’s former faculty page read. “He is currently exploring restorative justice from an   perspective. ” According to Berekelyside, a local newspaper, Clanton is being held on a $200, 000 bail on suspicion of three accounts of assault with a deadly weapon. Until Wednesday night, Berkeley investigators had declined to say whether they were looking into Clanton, despite the outcry online calling for his arrest. Wednesday, officers arrested him in Oakland at 12:15 p. m. He is being held at Berkeley Jail with a bail of $200, 000, according to Alameda County sheriff’s office records online. Clanton, whose listed occupation is college professor, is scheduled for arraignment Friday. Police said they have identified three victims in the case. All three were struck in the head or neck with a bike lock, police said. Berkeley Police Captain Ed Spiller claimed that Clanton was tracked down at a location in Oakland, California, before adding that he found the video footage from the incident “shocking. ” “We’re taking every case seriously.

by Geoffrey Grider DONALD TRUMP HAS A SLIM ADVANTAGE IN FLORIDA AS CRITICAL INDEPENDENT VOTERS NARROWLY BREAK HIS WAY IN THE MUST-WIN BATTLEGROUND STATE, A BLOOMBERG POLITICS POLL SHOWS. I can’t speak for south Florida , but as a longtime resident of north Florida I can promise you that there is a near frenzy of support for Donald Trump here. Over the past year I have seen endless amounts of Trump signs, stickers and banners. I saw a fair amount of pro-Bernie stuff as well. But pro-Hillary advertising? It’s practically non-existent, I haven’t even seen half a dozen stickers and absolutely zero lawn signs. So I find it astonishing when I turn on the “news” and hear the libs talking about Hillary’s double-digit lead over Trump. It’s not true, don’t believe it. Donald Trump is doing great and is on track to win the White House in just under two weeks. The Republican presidential nominee has 45 percent to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 43 percent among likely voters when third-party candidates are included, the poll found . In a hypothetical two-way race, Trump has 46 percent to Clinton’s 45 percent. DONALD TRUMP RALLY IN SAINT AUGUSTINE DRAWS TENS OF THOUSANDS: 
With over 4,000 people already inside the Saint Augustine Amphitheater, I took 60 seconds to do a walk-thru of just a fraction of the thousands of people in the overflow section who stood there for hours waiting to see Donald Trump. This is the type of support Trump has here in Florida. Among independents , Trump gets 43 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent in a head-to-head contest. When third-party candidates are included, Trump picks up 1 point with independents while Clinton drops to 37 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson taking 9 percent and the Green Party’s Jill Stein getting 5 percent. “This race may come down to the independent vote,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, who oversaw the survey. “ Right now, they tilt for Trump . By a narrow margin, they opted for Obama over Romney in 2012.” Trump’s showing in this poll is stronger than in other recent surveys in the state. Trump is also surging ahead of HIllary in Ohio and and is rapidly closing the gap in Pennsylvania. CNN ANCHOR’S STUNNED WHEN FACT CHECKER CONFIRMS HILLARY’S CORRUPTION:",0

Rigged elections. Vigilante observers. Angry voters. The claims, threats and passions surrounding the presidential race have led communities around the U.S. to move polling places out of schools or cancel classes on Election Day. 
The fear is that the ugly rhetoric of the campaign could escalate into confrontations and even violence in school hallways, endangering students. 
“If anybody can sit there and say they don’t think this is a contentious election, then they aren’t paying much attention,” said Ed Tolan, police chief in Falmouth, Maine, which decided to call off classes on Election Day and put additional officers on duty Nov. 8. 
{snip} 
Schools are popular polling places because they have plenty of parking and are usually centrally located. It’s difficult to say how many school-based polling places have been moved this year, given how decentralized the voting process is across the country. 
But state and local officials say voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. 
“There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering, that we didn’t have 15 or 20 years ago. What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something?” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. “If that happens at a school, then that’s certainly concerning.” 
{snip} 
Easton Superintendent John Reinhart wanted to get voting out of schools altogether but was rebuffed by county election officials. So the school board canceled classes on Election Day. 
“If you take the personalities away and cast the emotion with the election aside, one has to ask the question: ‘Are our schools the best places for that activity to take place?'” he said. “I just think we’ve reached the point where we need to look at other locations.”

Orono, MN – For more than a year, we have been following the story of a Minnesota man, Jay Nygard, who is routinely risking jail time because he refuses to remove a wind turbine from his property. Nygard has been in and out of court over the years, and despite a short-lived victory last October, he was recently back in front of a judge facing a contempt of court charge for refusing a court order to remove the turbines from his property. 
He did eventually remove the turbines, leaving only the cement bases because removing them would cause structural damage to their house. This was not good enough for the local government, who ignored the advice of three different engineers and demanded that they remove the bases, despite the risk of damaging the home. This is all that remains of the windmill on Nygard’s property, a concrete footing, in the ground. 
On Friday, Nygard was arrested and, according to his son, has been given six months in prison for refusing to remove the base. 
According to Kahler Nygard, Jay’s son, his father even attempted to make peace with the county and compromise on a number of different issues, but they ignored his appeals. 
“The choices for my dad were to potentially destroy our foundation in the house or go to jail, he even offered an olive branch saying he would add an easement to the deed saying when the house is demolished the pad must be removed, but that was ignored also, ” Kahler said in an exclusive interview with The Free Thought Project. 
“The base was level with the ground and 4 feet cubed. We removed the top half of the concrete and used a metal cutting tool to remove the top half of the bolt assembly, rendering the structure unusable,” Kahler explained. 
“They say that we have to remove to footing 100% and have it inspected by the city, which we have three different engineers all saying we should just leave it , one of them even does contract work for the city, ” he added. 
Kahler said that although there are no ordinances against windmills, the county has a personal vendetta against his family. 
Nygard has the right to do whatever he wants with his own property, but unfortunately in a democracy such as the United States, the property rights of an individual can be overridden according to the whims of politicians and the demands of uninvolved third parties. 
Please share this story with your friends and family in hopes of keeping a good man, whose only “crime” was self-sustainability, out of jail.

As mentioned in a recent story about Megyn Kelly on The Wildfire, if TrumpTV becomes a reality, a media war will loom over who is the real “conservative” leader in cable news. Prepping the terrain would mean starting to carve out a hard right audience and yank it away from Fox News. 4.

Since Ailes has stepped down, there are two interim co-presidents at Fox News: Bill Shine and Jack Aberneth.

Various media outlets jumped the gun today when they raced each other to announce that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had reopened their investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails. But less than two hours later it’s clear that what actually happened has been blown way out of proportion and out of context. 
FBI Director James Comey announced to Congress today that “investigators are examining newly discovered emails that ‘appear to be pertinent’ to the email probe. Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update you.” Clarifying: Comey doesn’t say the FBI is reopening the Clinton investigation per se, rather that it’s assessing newly found emails.

The new emails were not “hidden” or “recovered” or related to her email server in any way. 
The emails were discovered on the cellular device of former Congressman Anthony Wiener as part of an unrelated probe into whether or not Wiener was sending sexually explicit messages and photographs to minors. What the new emails contain is anyone’s guess, but they are not to or from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Wiener’s soon-to-be ex-wife Huma Abedin is a longtime aide to Clinton. 
The media has been just as complicit as the Republican witch-hunters in Congress in perpetuating these baseless smears against the credibility of Hillary Clinton, one of our nation’s most dedicated public servants. 
While Republicans are leaping on this news in hopes it will revive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s flailing campaign, these “developments” are nothing but a non-story from an overly impressionable media desperate for views on a slow Friday afternoon and deserves no more of your time.",0
22677,"Russia, China, Japan & South Korea Planning Solar & Wind Energy Super Grid","Russia, China, Japan & South Korea Planning Solar & Wind Energy Super Grid Nov 13, 2016 4 0 
The world is making a wonderful step forward this latest news. Business people from Russia, China, Japan and South Korea met in September in Tokyo to sign a Memorandum of Understanding that seeks to create the Asia Super Grid. The grid will consist of wind and solar technologies and will distribute clean energy throughout the world. 
According to SolarLove.com , the idea is dependent on development of an ultra-high voltage grid operating at more than 1,000 kilovolts AC and 800 kilovolts DC over thousands of kilometers. It envisions interconnecting grids across regions, nations, and even continents with a capacity of over 10 gigawatts. The Asian Super Grid. 
This idea came about as a solution to the devastating Fukushima nuclear fallout in 2011, thanks to Masayoshi Son. Masayoshi is the founder of the Internet business SoftBank Group and he created the Renewable Energy Institute after the Fukushima fallout. 
His idea was to tap into the massive amount of available wind and solar possibilities that could come from the Gobi Desert region in China, which is said to be equivalent to thousands of nuclear reactors. 
His big vision wasn’t supported by everyone though. “People said it was crazy, too grand a scheme…politically impossible.” 
However, soon after announcing his dream and vision, the Korea Electric Power Company and the State Grid Corporation of China contacted him and showed tremendous interest. Shortly after that, the Russians joined with PSJC Rosseti expressing interest to collaborate on the project as well. 
The creation of this super grid will help areas like Southern Africa, Europe, East and Southeast Asia, as well as the four major countries involved in the project. 
Though there have been political disputes between China and Japan especially, this project is being seen as a means to help usher in a new era of peace and prosperity throughout the Eastern hemisphere of our world. 
The project is underway and the group sees more projects like this continuing to pop up everywhere as the projected price efficiency of solar will be better than than fossil fuel energy by 2025, according to the groups calculations. 
Earlier this year, the well known Bill Nye was on CNN and said in the interview that we could power the world entirely with renewable energy right now if we really wanted. Obviously, political and financial interests are in the way of the goal currently, but perhaps this new Super Grid will not only be a technological example, but a political example that nations can unite in peace and for the common good of the planet and all it’s inhabitants.

There are a number of alien races known that currently operating on the Earth and in the human population. In an interview in 1998, Clifford Stone, a retired US Army sergeant who served in the army for 22 years and participated in covert operations, which should gain a crashed extraterrestrial ships and extraterrestrial biological entities (EBE) revealed that there are at 55 alien races, which they are known to the US government. 
By his knowledge of extraterrestrial races, a number are more active than others in interaction with people and can say that they have great significance for human evolution and sovereignty. A significant number of reports and testimonies involving different extraterrestrial races, from which it follows that the motives and actions of these races varies considerably, and on closer examination of these reports and statements can discern their intentions. 
The most compelling testimony concerning different extraterrestrial races comes from ""confidential sources"" as Sergeant Stone, who for a long time served in the military and / or corporations that participated in 'black projects ""and the"" contactees ""who have had direct physical contact with extraterrestrials and communicated with them. This applies to both 'contactees' in the classic sense who voluntarily engage in interaction with extraterrestrial races and 'abductees' who have been involuntarily incorporated into extraterrestrial programs. First, I'll report on those persons who are the main sources of information from various alien races and generally operating in the country, then I will try to specify the description of the motivations and activities of these races using available sources.

22680,Apple’s iOS 10 Is Available for Beta Testers Who Want a Head Start - The New York Times,"Apple on Thursday released an early version of its next mobile operating system, which will deliver some of the most substantial changes to iPhones and iPads in years. So for those who are eager to try all the new features and are willing to be guinea pigs, there are a few important things to know about upgrading to the software. The system, iOS 10, became available as a public beta, which means intrepid iPhone and iPad owners get to sample it and give feedback while Apple and developers continue to test it and to stomp out bugs before the software is more widely released in the fall. For most consumers, there is little reason to upgrade this soon the free, official iOS upgrade is only a few months away, and operating systems generally get better with time. Yet there can be some benefits to upgrading now. Early adopters who want a head start on using some of the  iOS 10 features, like a new messaging app and improved photo software, should jump in, for example. There is a communal benefit to upgrading now, too. If more early testers report bugs and give other feedback to Apple, it is less likely that major problems will remain on release. Microsoft used a similar public testing process for its operating system Windows 10, to gather information and fix problems. Though many consumers have run into hiccups with Windows 10, it has generally received positive reviews. If you are hopping on the   train for iOS, here are some tips for making the experience smoother and for avoiding disaster. The first step in obtaining the iOS beta is to sign up for Apple’s testing program, which involves signing in with your Apple ID on an Apple webpage. After enrolling, you will receive an email with steps on installing the upgrade. Before installing the upgrade, it is crucial to back up your device data in case something goes wrong. Apple recommends backing up your iPhone or iPad over a wired connection to a computer running the latest version of its iTunes software. After opening iTunes, select your Apple device and hit the Back Up Now button to create a backup on the computer. If something goes awry  —   for example, if an important app ceases to work properly  —   be aware of the steps to roll back to the previous version of iOS, which are listed on Apple’s support website. You will need to erase the new software and use iTunes to restore the backup you created on your computer, which will kick you back to iOS 9. After you have safely installed the iOS 10 beta, get familiar with some of the new features. Some big changes won’t be usable yet  —   a smarter Siri voice assistant, for example, is awaiting   developers to update their apps to work with Siri. For now, a new Messages app, which lets you send drawings and animations to other iOS 10 users, will be the biggest change. Apple also made its Photos app smarter  —   a feature called Memories will automatically compile multiple photos from an occasion, like your trip to Spain, into video montages. You can also test Apple’s redesigned apps for music, maps and news. A bonus for iPhone 6S or 6S Plus owners is they can use 3D Touch, the feature that triggers different actions based on how hard you press the touch screen, to try some new tricks in iOS 10. When sending a text message, pressing harder on the send arrow opens a menu where you can select an animation to embed, like neon lasers or birthday balloons. Also, when a   notification pops up on the iPhone’s lock screen, you can use 3D Touch to press down on the notification and reply to the message without logging in.",0
22682,Study: Losing Your Smartphone Is Nearly as Stressful as a Terrorist Threat - Breitbart,"Losing your smartphone is often nearly as stressful as the threat of a terrorist attack, according to a recent report. [“A report by The Physiological Society, asked 2, 000 people to rate how stressful they found key events,” reported The Telegraph on Wednesday. “While obvious situations such as the death of a loved one, or becoming seriously ill scored highly, so did modern concerns such as identity theft, commuter delays and even going on holiday. The threat of a terror attack came 13th on the list of stressful events, just one point above losing a smartphone, and well below planning a wedding, or moving house. ”  Going on holiday, receiving a promotion at work, and Brexit all came below people losing their smartphones in terms of stress levels. The report also found that London was the area most stressed about Brexit in the U. K. while Scotland was the most relaxed about commute delays. Younger people were naturally more stressed about losing their smartphone than older generations, however, the threat of “serious illness” created more stress as people grew older. “Like smartphone loss, identity theft is also a relatively modern stressor, but in this case was much more stressful for older people (55+) perhaps suggesting they are less sure what to do about it,” claimed the report. “Participants were also asked to fill in any other particularly stressful events which they felt the survey had missed out. The most common responses concerned driving: car breakdowns, suffering traffic, busy motorways, road rage, or being the passenger of a careless driver all featured. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

22685,World Jewish Congress Hits Anti-Defamation League for Crying Wolf,"World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder released a statement Saturday evening chiding   League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt for criticizing President Donald Trump’s statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which did not specifically mention Jews. [President Trump’s statement read:  “It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror. “Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light shines the brightest.‎ As we remember those who died, we are deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the innocent. “In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world. ” Greenblatt, a former Obama administration official who has led opposition to Trump’s appointment of Stephen K. Bannon to a White House advisory role, tweeted on Friday: “@WhiteHouse statement on #HolocaustMemorialDay, misses that it was six million Jews who perished, not just ‘innocent people’   …     Puzzling and troubling @WhiteHouse #HolocaustMemorialDay stmt has no mention of Jews.

Our community gains nothing if we reach a point where manufactured outrages reduce public sensitivity to the real dangers we confront. ” Jews were the only group singled out for destruction by the Nazis, as Nazi ideology believed that Jews were an inferior race who had used their ideas to prevent superior races from engaging in a bloody struggle to establish the fittest. However, there were millions of other people murdered in the Holocaust, including Gypsies, gays, political dissidents, and large numbers of civilians in Eastern Europe. Though the international community observes the memory of the Holocaust in January, Jews typically observe a special Holocaust memorial day, Yom HaShoah, which occurs in spring, according to the Hebrew calendar. The World Jewish Congress describes itself as “the international organization representing Jewish communities in 100 countries to governments, parliaments and international organizations. ” Joel B.

Schumer also released a statement on Trump’s decision: President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement is a devastating failure of historic proportions,” Schumer said. “Future generations will look back on President Trump’s decision as one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing.

22689,Illegal Immigrants Surging to US-Mexico Border in Race Against Election Day,"Illegal Immigrants Surging to US-Mexico Border in Race Against Election Day William La Jeunesse, Fox News, November 3, 2016 
Americans aren’t the only ones motivated by Tuesday’s election. The presidential race has immigrants from around the world racing to the U.S.-Mexican border, as the cartels exploit a powerful narrative: get into the U.S. while you still can. 
“Smugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there’s a chance,” said Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., whose views were echoed by another agent in Texas. 
“People think if one candidate wins, certain things will happen, like a giant wall being built and then they can never get through,” said Chris Cabrera, an agent in the Rio Grande Valley. “Another faction believes that if the other candidate wins, they’ll get amnesty if they’re here by a certain date.” 
Those two competing narratives–triggered by the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, respectively–are driving immigration numbers the Border Patrol hasn’t seen in years in some sectors. 
“We are overwhelmed,” said a veteran agent in McAllen, Texas. “We are seeing 800 to 1,000 apprehensions every night.” 
In fiscal 2016, the Border Patrol apprehended 117,200 immigrants from Central America, almost one-third of all apprehensions border-wide–and 5,000 more than during the so-called surge of 2014. The agency also apprehended 5,000 Haitians, up from just 700 last year. The number of immigrants claiming to be from Africa and Asia also is up. 
{snip} 
The poverty and violence plaguing many of these countries helps push immigrants north, Beeson said. Pull factors include available and good-paying jobs in the U.S. and immigration policy that provides work permits and freedom for immigrants while the courts adjudicate their ‘asylum’ claim. 
“When you stop somebody, you ask their name and the first thing they tell you is–‘I’m here for asylum, I can’t go home because they’ll kill me.’ . . . When it takes a good five or six minutes just to get their name out of them, they have a rehearsed story,” said Cabrera. “Once they get those papers saying they can pass through our checkpoint, we’ll never see them again.” 
Del Cueto said the agents are “not getting any backing” from D.C. and “we need to start enforcing every single immigration law we have on the books.” 
Del Cueto and Cabrera belong to the National Border Patrol Council, which represents the Border Patrol’s 18,000 field agents who are prohibited from talking openly to the media.",0

22693,Katie Ledecky Smashes Her Own World Record in 400 Freestyle - The New York Times,"After finishing, having roared through the last 50 meters of the   freestyle at a sprinter’s pace, Katie Ledecky turned around to see the scoreboard. It told her what she surely already knew: she had won gold, her first of the Rio Games, and she had crushed her own world record. “To see the 56 up there feels really good,” Ledecky said, referring to her time, 3 minutes 56. 46 seconds. Her previous record was 3:58. 37. Jazz Carlin of Britain won silver in 4:01. 23, and Ledecky’s teammate Leah Smith was third in 4:01. 92. It was the 12th world record Ledecky has set since the 2012 London Olympics. She skipped the 3:57s altogether, but that was her plan. She said a 3:56 had been her goal for the past three years. She needed only 28. 92 seconds to cover the final 50 meters, a burst that is not supposed to happen in this event. “I just let it all out,” she said. Only two women have gone under four minutes: Ledecky and Italy’s Federica Pellegrini, who twice accomplished the feat in 2009 while wearing the   buoyant suits that since have been banned. Ledecky, a rising freshman at Stanford, was the first to surpass 3:59 when she set the previous mark, a 3:58. 37 at the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships. She now owns the 10 fastest performances in the 400. Ledecky’s victory is the first gold medal of these Olympics for American swimmers, and it came the day after she made her Olympic sprint debut, anchoring the U. S.   freestyle relay that earned the silver medal and set an American record. Ledecky, who will defend her Olympic title in the 800 freestyle later this week, increased her stroke rate for the   race. Her coach, Bruce Gemmell, had to remind Ledecky to slow her tempo for the   race to avoid, in her words, “spinning my wheels. ” A few minutes after Ledecky’s victory, the United States men’s 4x100 relay won gold. The foursome of Caeleb Dressel, Michael Phelps, Ryan Held and Nathan Adrian beat France and the favorites, Australia. Bob Bowman, the men’s coach, credited Ledecky with an assist. “When you see an otherworldly swim like that the guys know they have to step up,” Bowman said. “How can you not be inspired when you see something like that?”",0
22694,Donald Trump Slips Further Behind Hillary Clinton in New Polls - The New York Times,"Weeks of provocative and outlandish behavior have hurt Donald J. Trump’s standing in two new national polls of registered voters, which showed the presumptive Republican presidential nominee falling further behind Hillary Clinton. A Washington   News survey had Mrs. Clinton with a   lead: 51 percent to 39 percent. A Wall Street   News poll had Mrs. Clinton with a smaller advantage of five percentage points. Both polls, released on Sunday, showed Mr. Trump in worse shape than he had been a month ago, as voters in the latest polls expressed doubts about his preparedness and qualifications to lead the nation. Nearly two in three Americans say they think Mr. Trump is unqualified to be president and are anxious about the idea of him in the White House, the   poll found. In contrast, 61 percent think Mrs. Clinton is qualified. Mr. Trump is coming off two particularly damaging weeks for his campaign  —   a period in which he personally attacked a   judge hearing a lawsuit against Trump University, gloated about predicting attacks like the Orlando massacre that left 49 dead, and fired his embattled campaign manager. Despite his woes, not all the results of the new polls were heartening for Mrs. Clinton. The   survey found that her lead essentially disappears when candidates from the Green Party and Libertarian Party are included. She essentially tied Mr. Trump, with 39 percent to his 38 percent. Together,   candidates grabbed 16 percent of the support. Senior aides to both candidates spoke on Sunday morning news shows, and their words left little doubt about the intensity that the race is taking on now that the nominating fights have ended. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said on Fox News Sunday, “Donald Trump is probably one of the most reckless, unfit candidates to ever seek the presidency. ” Mrs. Clinton, he said, is “probably one of the most prepared. ” Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, insisted that he and Mr. Trump had built an operation that was able to take on Mrs. Clinton, addressing concerns from Republicans that their infrastructure is inadequate. “Our campaign is organized,” Mr. Manafort told NBC’s “Meet the Press. ” ”We’re ready, we’re going to have a good convention, and we’re confident that we are not behind the Clinton campaign,” Mr. Manafort added.",0

As the most recent viewership numbers show, Kelly’s program indicates a decided downward shift from Bill O’Reilly’s lead-in program, and then, even more damning for Kelly, is how the ratings jump back up for the Sean Hannity program, even though Hannity should, given the later time slot, have the smaller audience.

22699,Trump Repeats Bogus Claim That Captain Khan Would Still Be Alive If He Were President," 58 pm Again, Donald Trump was not opposed to the war in Iraq.   
Ever since Donald Trump was lambasted by leaders in both parties for fighting with a Gold Star family and dishonoring the service of Captain Humayun Khan, he’s been trying out a new approach: pretending Khan would still be alive if he was president. 
Khan was killed in 2004 in a suicide attack in Iraq. 
When the Republican was asked in an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos if he thinks he should apologize for the way he treated the Khan family following the Democratic National Convention, he repeated this bogus claim. 
Video: . @realDonaldTrump stands by claim slain U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan would still be alive if he had been president. https://t.co/VgLaQ0cJ3A pic.twitter.com/bcDiTMXY2k 
— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 26, 2016 
Trump said, “I have great respect for the Khan family, I have great respect for – I mean their son is a great hero – but if I were president at that time, Capt. Khan would be alive today, George, because I wouldn’t have been in Iraq … I was opposed to the war in Iraq.” 
As Hillary Clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign, Donald Trump was not opposed to the war in Iraq from the beginning. Had he been president at the time, the war still would have taken place because Trump was in favor of it. 
In fact, Trump’s campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies. This would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that America gets mired in more conflicts, not less. 
For their part, the Clinton campaign has continued to stand up to Trump’s attacks on the Khan family. In an emotional new ad released days ago, Capt. Khan’s father recounts how his son died protecting “everyone in his unit.” Khan’s father asked of Trump, “Would my son have a place in your America?” 
The answer to Mr. Khan’s question is a resounding “no,” as Trump has promised to ban Muslims – like the Khans – from even entering the United States. For those living here already, a President Trump would treat them like criminals. 
Donald Trump will likely continue to rewrite history when it comes to his initial support of military intervention in Iraq. But after spending so much time throwing mud at the Khan family, it’s unlikely that anybody will buy it.",0

22702,"Woman Who Took Husband’s Intestine on Flight Wanted It Tested, Lawyer Says - The New York Times","BERLIN  —   A Moroccan woman who took a piece of her dead husband’s intestine on a flight to their home in Austria was carrying the sample because she suspected that he had been poisoned and she wanted European doctors to examine it, her lawyer said on Tuesday. The woman, 35, who has not been publicly identified, packed the   piece in her checked baggage on a flight to the southern Austrian city of Graz, where she and her husband, 40, had been living for eight years, said the lawyer, Anton Karner. Mr. Karner said his client had been acting on the advice of a doctor in Marrakesh who shared her suspicion that her husband had been poisoned at a meal the couple ate while visiting his relatives. The Moroccan doctor extracted the piece of intestine, Mr. Karner said, and apparently helped pack it in formaldehyde and in thick plastic containers. Gerald Höfler, who leads the pathology institute in Graz where the intestine is being examined, described the packaging as very professional. “I would imagine that it was done by a pathologist,” he said. “It was absolutely secure, triple wrapped, according to European Union norms. ” Dr. Höfler said the results of the examination would probably not be known until next week. The unusual cargo was found by customs officials on Sept. 8 after they searched the woman’s bag as part of standard random checks when she landed in Graz, said Johannes Pasquali, a spokesman for the Austrian Finance Ministry, which oversees the country’s customs operations. The story was first reported over the weekend by Kleine Zeitung, the main local newspaper in Graz. Leo Josefus, a spokesman for the police in the state of Styria, of which Graz is the capital, said customs officials had first turned to the police for guidance. Officers determined that the woman had violated no Austrian laws by bringing the sample into the country, and the intestine was then sent to Dr. Höfler’s clinic. Mr. Karner, who declined to name his client, said she suspected poisoning after the family meal because some members of her husband’s family had opposed their marriage.",0

Look who's pretending they're a humanitarian Originally appeared at The Libertarian Institute 
Last week, The Washington Post reported that the Beltway’s foreign policy elite is salivating at the prospect of a more hawkish Hillary Clinton administration. 
Apparently, the Obama administration’s reluctance to intervene directly in Syria is driving the liberal interventionalists and the neocons crazy. The out-of-power imperialists of the left and right, though, have been biding their time and doing what they do best: writing reports that only the foreign policy elite read inside the imperial city. Absurdly, or maybe the better word is frighteningly, the foreign policy elite’s reports and studies “call for more-aggressive American action to constrain Iran, rein in the chaos in the Middle East and check Russia in Europe.” The idea that Washington could bring order to the chaos it helped create in the greater Middle East is lunacy. 
Come November 9, the nation better start preparing itself for more of the same with the almost guaranteed ascension of President Clinton the Second: perpetual, wealth-sapping, rights-eviscerating war. 
But what was particularly striking about the article was the appearance of former Secretary of State and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright discussing the need for more muscular American intervention in Syria. 
“The immediate thing is to do something to alleviate the horrors that are being visited on the population,” said former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who is leading a bipartisan and international team looking at U.S. strategy in the Middle East for the Atlantic Council. 
“We do think there needs to be more American action — not ground forces but some additional help in terms of the military aspect.” 
Just in time for Halloween, Secretary Albright wants to dress up like a humanitarian. But fortunately we know that Secretary Albright believes that the lives of innocent children are okay to sacrifice in the pursuit of a U.S-led international order.* Back in 1996, Albright showed what’s truly under that humanitarian costume during an interview with 60 Minutes on the toll of U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iraq: 
Lesley Stahl on sanctions against Iraq: We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean, that’s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it? 
Madeleine Albright: I think this is a very hard choice, but the price–we think the price is worth it. 
These are the kinds of people ready to assume the commanding heights of the U.S. national security apparatus soon after Inauguration Day. They make the hard choices you don’t want to make, and the price is worth it. 
* NOTE: For a good analysis of exactly how many Iraqi children under five years old died because of U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iraq, see Matt Welch’s Reason piece from 2002, “ The Politics of Dead Children .” Did you enjoy this article? - Consider helping us!
