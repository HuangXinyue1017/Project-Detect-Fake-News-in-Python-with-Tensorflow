20803,"Tim Tebow Will Attempt Another Comeback, This Time in Baseball - The New York Times","If at first you don’t succeed, try a different sport. Tim Tebow, who was a Heisman   quarterback at the University of Florida but was unable to hold an N. F. L. job, is pursuing a career in Major League Baseball. He will hold a workout for M. L. B. teams this month, his agents told ESPN and other news outlets. “This may sound like a publicity stunt, but nothing could be further from the truth,” said Brodie Van Wagenen,   of CAA Baseball, part of the sports agency CAA Sports, in the statement. “I have seen Tim’s workouts, and people inside and outside the industry  —   scouts, executives, players and fans  —   will be impressed by his talent. ” It’s been over a decade since Tebow, 28, has played baseball full time, which means a comeback would be no easy task. But the former major league catcher Chad Moeller, who said in the statement that he had been training Tebow in Arizona, said he was “beyond impressed with Tim’s athleticism and swing. ” “I see bat speed and power and real baseball talent,” Moeller said. “I truly believe Tim has the skill set and potential to achieve his goal of playing in the major leagues and based on what I have seen over the past two months, it could happen relatively quickly. ” Or, take it from Gary Sheffield, the former   outfielder. News of Tebow’s attempted comeback in baseball was greeted with skepticism on Twitter. As a junior at Nease High in Ponte Vedra, Fla. Tebow drew the attention of major league scouts, batting . 494 with four home runs as a left fielder. But he ditched the bat and glove in favor of pigskin, leading Florida to two national championships, in 2007 and 2009. Two former scouts for the Los Angeles Angels told WEEI, a Boston radio station, that Tebow had been under consideration as a high school junior. “’x80’x9cWe wanted to draft him, ’x80’x9cbut he never sent back his information card,” said one of the scouts, Tom Kotchman, referring to a questionnaire the team had sent him. “He had a strong arm and had a lot of power,” said the other scout, Stephen Hargett. “If he would have been there his senior year he definitely would have had a good chance to be drafted. ” “It was just easy for him,” Hargett added. “You thought, If this guy dedicated everything to baseball like he did to football how good could he be?” Tebow’s high school baseball coach, Greg Mullins, told The Sporting News in 2013 that he believed Tebow could have made the major leagues. “He was the leader of the team with his passion, his fire and his energy,” Mullins said. “He loved to play baseball, too. He just had a bigger fire for football. ” Tebow wouldn’t be the first athlete to switch from the N. F. L. to M. L. B. Bo Jackson had one   season as a Kansas City Royal, and Deion Sanders played several years for the Atlanta Braves with mixed success. Though Michael Jordan tried to cross over to baseball from basketball as a    in 1994, he did not fare as well playing one year for a Chicago White Sox minor league team. As a football player, Tebow was unable to match his college success in the pros. The Denver Broncos drafted him in the first round of the 2010 N. F. L. Draft, and he quickly developed a reputation for clutch performances, including a memorable   pass against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2011 Wild Card round. But his stats and his passing form weren’t pretty, and he spent just two years in Denver before moving to the Jets in 2012, where he spent his last season on an N. F. L. roster. He was cut during preseason from the New England Patriots in 2013 and from the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015.",0

20805,Trump is USA's antique hero. Clinton will be next president,"Trump is USA's antique hero. Clinton will be next president 08.11.2016 | Source: AP photo FBI Director James Comey said on November 6 that his department would not be criminally charging Hillary Clinton for revelations found in her email correspondence. Earlier, however, the FBI had flagged Clinton's email case as a file of high priority. It was said that the FBI had collected a lot of evidence. All of a sudden, it was announced that Clinton would be cleared. Pravda.Ru asked political scientist and publicist Leonid Krutakov to comment on such a development. ""Was it a though-out move to show that Clinton is not guilty?"" ""Did you expect a criminal case against Clinton right before the election? I thought of such a plan if Trump were winning, but now that they have cleared her name, it means that Hillary Clinton will win the election. One can be sure for 100 percent that Hillary Clinton will be the next President of the United States of America. ""I do not think that the FBI Director made that decision independently. This is a political figure, this is a job to which people are appointed by someone else. It is stupid to believe that one FBI director will stand up against the whole elite that prints money and runs business and international politics. The times of ancient heroes have passed. Trump has tried to become one. He has proclaimed a new era, not only in America but in the world, and the electorate that has consolidated around Trump will not go anywhere after the election. ""One needs another war and another threat to America to make Trump's electorate change their mind. As we remember, George W. Bush won the election in no less controversial election battles, when votes in Florida were recounted manually.

20814,"Computer Programmer Comes Forward, Admits To Being Paid To Rig Voting Booths! TRUMP WAS RIGHT! • USA Newsflash","
VIA Conservative Tribune 
In 2000, computer programmer Clinton “Clint” Curtis was ordered to design an undetectable computer program that could flip the results of a close election, according to ClashDaily and the St. Petersburg Times, now the Tampa Bay Times . 
Curtis testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee that his employer, Yang Enterprises Inc., told him, “We need to steal an election.” The program was intended for the computerized voting machines to which Florida would be transitioning starting in 2002.

CLICK HERE TO SEE THE VIDEO 
This is it, folks. Despite the liberal media’s efforts to convince us all otherwise and paint naysayers as conspiracy theorists, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is right. Rigging an election has never been easier. 
The left painted Clint Curtis as a nut, a conspiracy theorist, a disgruntled ex-employee. They published photoshopped images of him wearing a tinfoil hat and did everything possible to discredit one man who was standing up for the truth. 
Curtis voluntarily took a polygraph test, alleging that one of the consultants at his employer was a Chinese national and convicted spy. Yang Enterprises denied ever knowing consultant Hai Lin Nee, while in fact they had been assisting him for years in repeatedly extending his U.S. Visa. 
The Florida Department of Transportation inspector investigating the ballot tampering allegations, Raymond Lemme, was found dead in an apparent suicide. Both Curtis and Lemme’s family members believe he was murdered. 
In 2005, computer experts demonstrated for officials in Leon County, Florida, how simple it was to flip election results while leaving no detectable trace of their efforts. 
Where is the liberal media in all this? Where are the Democrats who are supposedly so concerned with our fundamental rights? 
They’re in a back room, preparing to steal an election if the people’s voice isn’t heard on Election Day. On Nov. 8, be that decent person standing up for truth. 
What are your thoughts on this? Do you think that the election is rigged?

20817,"College Republicans, YAF Sue Berkeley over Ann Coulter Event - Breitbart","The Berkeley College Republicans and the Young America’s Foundation have filed a lawsuit against members of the University of California system for their role in restricting an upcoming speaking event featuring Ann Coulter. [Our lawsuit agst Berkeley filed moments ago. @thomasfullerNYT at failing NYT won’t understand it. Read it yourself https:  .   —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 24, 2017,   The suit alleges that administrators unlawfully violated the student’s rights to free expression on campus by placing unusual restrictions on events that the Berkeley College Republicans organized. An event featuring renowned conservative commentator David Horowitz was canceled after the university forced students to hold the event at 3 PM when most students are in class, at a venue far from the center of campus. According to the suit, Berkeley is accused of engaging in a discriminatory practice of applying unusual time and venue restrictions on events planned by the UCB College Republicans. These restrictions have led to the cancellation of two events in the month of April 2017. Defendants engage in a pattern and practice of enforcing a recently adopted, unwritten and unpublished policy that vests in University officials the unfettered discretion to unreasonably restrict the time, place, and manner of any campus event involving “  speakers”  —   a term that is wholly undefined, and that has enabled Defendants to apply this policy in a discriminatory fashion, resulting in the marginalization of the expression of conservative viewpoints on campus by any notable conservative speaker. Defendants freely admit that they have permitted the demands of a faceless, rabid,   mob to dictate what speech is permitted at the center of campus during prime time, and which speech may be marginalized, burdened, and regulated out of its very existence by this unlawful heckler’s veto. The suit condemns the University of California system for failing to provide an academic environment that promotes free debate and the free exchange of ideas, which students were promised at the time of their enrollment. Though UC Berkeley promises its students an environment that promotes free debate and the free exchange of ideas, it had breached this promise through the repressive actions of University administrators and campus police, who have systematically and intentionally suppressed   expression by Plaintiffs (and the many UC Berkeley students whose political viewpoints align with Plaintiffs) simply because that expression may anger or offend students, UC Berkeley administators,   community members who do not share Plaintiffs’ viewpoints.

20818,Trump Melts Down And Accuses The US Postal Service Of Stealing The Election For Clinton,"Trump warned his supporters that the US Postal Service is trying to steal the election for Hillary Clinton in Colorado. 
Video: 
At a rally in Golden, CO, Trump said: 
I have real problems with ballots being sent. Does that make sense? 
Like people saying, “Oh, here’s a ballot. Here’s another ballot. Throw it away. Oh, here’s one I like. We’ll keep that one.” 
I have real problems, so get your ballots in. 
Trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots, as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about Hillary Clinton’s emails. 
Donald Trump appears to be losing his mind. He also seems to think that accusing the US Postal Service and election officials of stealing the election for Hillary Clinton is going to motivate Republicans to vote. 
Consider the contradiction in Trump’s message. The Republican nominee tells his supporters that the US Postal Service is throwing away ballots, while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots. 
If their ballots are going to be thrown away by USPS, why should Republicans bother mailing their ballots in? 
It is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense. Trump’s inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why Republicans on pace to lose this election. 
Donald Trump’s descent into paranoid senior citizen continues to play out in front of the entire nation, as the Republican nominee for president believes that his letter carrier is out to get him,",0
20819,Visiting Madagascar? Leave Red Swimsuits (and Lemur Recipes) at Home - The New York Times,"If you visit a certain beach in northeastern Madagascar, don’t wear red and don’t even think of speaking French. Across most of the island nation, be very careful where you point, lest your finger accidentally find an ancestor’s grave. And in certain areas of the country, do your best not to defecate in the same place twice. Behavior in Madagascar is governed by thousands of cultural taboos, or fady (pronounced  ) many of which involve food (don’t eat goat or eel) days of the week (no funerals or farming on Tuesday) and objects (don’t use shovels with firm handles to bury the dead). Specific places associated with ancestors, who are revered, also carry a lot of fady (no playing of a game similar to    near a tomb). Some of these prohibitions apply only in a single community, or even to a single family, while others are followed regionally. Breaking a fady invites both social shame and even direr consequences from the ancestors believed to enforce them. The repercussions can be as specific as the taboos: Sing while eating and your teeth will grow uncomfortably long. If a fady is considered overly onerous  —   say, a travel restriction that interferes with a promising business opportunity  —   a ritual negotiation can be held with the ancestors. To outsiders, fady can seem like a long and random list of superstitious rules, some silly (don’t build verandas, and don’t pass an egg directly to another person) some environmentally beneficial (eating most species of lemurs is fady, as is fishing in certain parts of the sea, to the benefit of coral reefs) and some harmful (among the Antambahoaka, an ethnic group in the southeast, a fady against raising twins led to a practice of abandoning them in the forest, and a fady against eating dried sweet potato has contributed to malnutrition). But Sarah Osterhoudt, an anthropologist at Indiana University, said fady are crucial to the identity and worldview of the Malagasy, as the people of Madagascar are known. “To the Malagasy, the idea of bringing together all different parts of life  —   the past and the present, the social and the political, the spiritual and the mundane”  —   is very important, she said. “Fady do this beautifully. ”",0
20820,Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups – Cheap and Full of Toxic Chemicals,"by ANYA V 
In 1928, a man named H.B. Reese, created the peanut butter cup. Mr. Reese was a dairy farmer and a shipping forman for Milton S. Hershey, and found him inspiring. 
Mr. Reese left dairy farming and created the Harry Burnett Reese Candy Co. in his basement within his home located in Hershey Pennsylvania. In 1956, Mr. Reese died, leaving his candy company to his six sons. In 1963, the Reese’ sons merged their fathers’ company with the Hershey Chocolate Corp. The merger was a tax-free, stock-for-stock merger. The six brothers received 666,316 common stocks valued at $23.5 million dollars in 1963. There are now 20 variations of Reese peanut butter cups. Even though Mr. Reese created a tasty candy and his six sons made wise business partnerships, their candy’s ingredients have become questionable. 
Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups are made with the controversial ingredient PGPR (Polyglycerol polyricinoleate, which is used as a substitute for cocoa butter. The FDA has determined it to be “safe for humans as long as you restrict your intake to 7.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Otherwise you’d be open to reversible liver enlargement at higher intakes”. 
Let’s take a look at the other ingredients in one of the worlds’ most favorite candy. 
Reese’s peanut butter cup ingredients: 
Milk chocolate, (milk, chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, no fat milk, milk fat, lactose, soy lecithin, PGPR), peanuts, sugar, dextrose, salt, TBHQ and citric acid. 
•PGPR (polyglycerol pilyricinoleate): Reese’s are made with this controversial ingredient PGPR that has replaced cocoa butter in an effort to cut down on manufacturing costs. PGPR is made from castor beans that reduces the viscosity of chocolate. This chemical has been found to cause gastrointestinal discomfort and allergic reaction in children. 
•Soy lecithin: 93% of soy is genetically modified. Soy lecithin can cause breast cancer, has negative effects on fertility and reproduction, may lead to behavioral and cerebral abnormalities. ( Read More About Soy Lecithin ) 
•TBHQ (tertiary butylhydroquinone): TBHQ comes from petroleum and is related to butane. This can be toxic and also cause nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ear, delirium and collapse. It is shown to cause stomach cancer in lab rats, fragment DNA and cause damage to humane lung and umbilical cells. In children it can cause anxiety, restlessness, and intensify the symptoms of ADHD.

С лёгкой руки итальянского режиссёра Тинто Брасса римский император Калигула стал символом самого порочного разврата и воплощением аморального поведения. Но даже у него отношения с миром братьев наших меньших, то есть животных, носили чисто платонический характер: Калигула назначил своего любимого коня сенатором, но отнюдь не любимой женой. Так что, согласно недавним сообщениям СМИ, актёр Алексей Панин, якобы занявшийся зоофилией, переплюнул самого одиозного, не считая Нерона, римского императора. 
Сам Панин, разумеется, всё категорически отрицает. По его словам, на скандальном видео с собакой заснят не он, а другой мужчина, очень похожий на Панина. (Помните, человек, похожий на прокурора, с женщинами, похожими на проституток?). В раскручивании этой омерзительной истории Панин обвиняет бывшую жену, которой почему-то не нравится то, что актёр не платит алименты. Коварная женщина смонтировала видеозапись и каким-то образом воздействовала на создателей программы «Говорим и показываем», рискнувших пустить её в эфир. В общем, кругом враги, но Панин не намерен сдаваться и пойдёт в суд, чтобы доказать, что он и близко не подходил к собаке ни с какой стороны. 
Тех, кто ещё не утомился следить за извилистым творческим путём Алексея Панина, разгоревшийся скандал не слишком удивляет: ведь основой своего имиджа этот актёр сознательно сделал крайний эпатаж на грани, а то и за гранью фола. То он голым по гостинице “Версаль” бегает, то публично, пардон, рукоблудием занимается, то в лифте гадит – чего, как известно, ни одна воспитанная собака себе не позволит. Что до мелких потасовок и матерных перепалок, то им уже самые преданные поклонники счёт потеряли. 
В показушном мире шоу-бизнеса, где слава является смыслом жизни, каждый пытается выделиться, чем может: кто-то большим талантом, кто-то большим бюстом, а кто-то непомерным непотребством. Здесь всё ясно, и обсуждать, в общем-то, нечего. Вопрос в другом: есть ли грань, за которую СМИ не смогут зайти в погоне за сенсацией? Неважно, кто заснят на зоофильском видео: есть вещи, которые просто нельзя демонстрировать на экране телевизора. И здесь, как ни странно, хочется поддержать Панина в его планируемом иске к авторам передачи: если цензуры нравов нет, это не значит, что напоказ всё дозволено. Так что, ещё неизвестно, кто переплюнул Калигулу: актёр или режиссёр программы.",0

20836,Krauthammer: Gorsuch Filibuster a ’Totally Illogical’ Move Fueled by ’Trump Derangement Syndrome’ - Breitbart,"On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that filibustering Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court is a “totally illogical” move Democrats are pursuing because they’re responding to the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” of their base.  Krauthammer said, “[I]t makes no sense. It’s totally illogical if you’re a Democrat. The fight is going to be over the next nominee. As you say, this nominee does not alter the balance of the court ideologically. The next very well could, whether it’s a Kennedy, or a Ginsburg, or a Breyer, it could be a radical change, a   if it’s a Kennedy, and that would have an effect. And you’d expect the Democrats to want to save their ammunition, but they are expending it here. ” He added, “I think they are, in some ways, suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, in the sense that they might not be personally deranged by his presence, but they have a base that has not recovered from the election, and they insist that anybody who represents them and does not want to face a primary fight, or have a demonstration outside their house on a weekend, is  —   will oppose what Trump is doing. This is about Trump. It isn’t about Gorsuch. And that I think, is their motive for doing it, but it makes no sense because, if this is the first partisan filibuster, it will be the last. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0

20841,"Trump: Confidence In Economy ’Has Reached Levels Not Seen In Many, Many Years’ - Breitbart","During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump stated, “Confidence in the American economy has reached levels not seen in many, many years. Unemployment fell to its lowest level in nearly ten years last month, and we created 211, 000 new jobs. ”[Transcript as Follows:   “My fellow Americans, Confidence in the American economy has reached levels not seen in many, many years. Unemployment fell to its lowest level in nearly ten years last month, and we created 211, 000 new jobs. Our economic progress is especially good news for the millions of young Americans who, at this time of the year, are putting on a cap and gown and receiving a diploma, certificate, or commission. So important, and we are so proud of them. This weekend, I am delighted to be participating first hand in the excitement by joining the students and faculty at Liberty University to celebrate the success of their graduates. I was invited to make the commencement address at West Point, but I will be away at the G7  —   and I look forward to that  —   and will be at West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy. Come to think about it, a few days later, I will actually travel to New London, Connecticut, to speak to the graduating cadets of the United States Coast Guard Academy about their new roles serving our country. So we’ll be with them very shortly. To young Americans at both schools, I will be bringing a message of hope and optimism about our nation’s bright future. That is a message that I want to extend to all young Americans today, especially those who are graduating this year and entering the labor force. We are also celebrating all of the Americans who learn the skills and trades that generations of workers have used to build, shape, and supply this nation. The people who construct, repair, and create with their own two hands are the people who make this nation run. And lots of those people voted for me. That’s also why, in my Administration, I am so deeply committed to technical and vocational education. I want you to know that my administration is working every single day to create new opportunities and to reverse years of stagnant growth, falling wages, and disappearing jobs. We are ending the sellout of American workers —  and lifting the burdens on American industry, manufacturing, and businesses. We are rolling back the   regulations that make it harder for companies to grow and hire in America. At the same time, we are unleashing American energy development to create thousands of new jobs on our soil and just off our shores. On trade, we have also taken historic action to protect American industry and bring back the kinds of   jobs that can support a middle class family  —   and in fact, most families. As a vote of confidence in these policies, business optimism is soaring and employment is rising. These are great signs for America’s future  —   the future that our new graduates will play with such a critical role in shaping our world and our country. I want every young citizen  —   regardless of education or geography  —   to be able to live out their American Dreams. So to all of America’s graduates, congratulations. And to all of America’s youth: we are here to help create the jobs and future you deserve. The brightest days are ahead of you. And I just look forward to seeing you at the Coast Guard Academy, and at Liberty University. Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless America. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
20843,Jason Miller Backs Out of White House Communications Job Under Trump - The New York Times,"Jason Miller, who was named as White House communications director by   Donald J. Trump two days ago, has informed Mr. Trump that he will not take the job, according to a statement from Mr. Miller. In the statement, Mr. Miller said he wanted to spend more time with his family. His wife is expecting their second child in January, he said. “It’s clear they need to be my top priority right now, and this is not the time to start a new job as demanding as White House communications director,” Mr. Miller wrote. A veteran of several Republican campaigns, Mr. Miller was an avid supporter of Mr. Trump, appearing regularly on television on his behalf throughout the campaign. He had been a principal spokesman during the transition period. In the statement, Mr. Miller said that Sean Spicer, who was recently named press secretary, would serve as communications director, as well.",0
20846,Exclusive-Rep. Dave Brat: RyanCare a Perverse Economic System - Breitbart,"Virginia Republican congressman Dave Brat told Breitbart News Saturday radio host Matt Boyle that the American Health Care Act bill written by Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .) is designed to save the insurance companies, not return health insurance and health care delivery to the free market. [Brat said the speaker is worried about the insurance companies, who backed the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, because the system they created cannot be sustained because of its perverse incentives, regulations, and costs.  In addition to the flaws in the Obamacare legislation and buildout, the congressman said it is foolish to attempt a political solution to an economic problem that forces you to accommodate the needs and values of 300 million Americans  —   such as people in both California and Texas  —   at the same time. The RyanCare bill is not connected to the promises President Donald Trump made on the campaign trail, said the former head of the economic department at   College. “We want Trump to be hugely successful, so we don’t want to handle a bill that’s going to fail in a few years,” he said. “Trump ran on   and competition across state lines, getting the price down  —   the price is going up by 20 percent and the bill we are getting ready to vote on, once again, goes back and does too much emphasis on the coverage aspect,” he said. Focusing on coverage makes it impossible for the bill to ever work, he said. “Five percent of the people with   conditions, et cetera  —   very serious issues that every bill deals with  —   but five percent of the folks will cost 50 percent of the entire health care market,” he said. A   condition has nothing to do with insurance, because the person already had the problem, he said. “That is not an insurance problem. That is a health care problem, and we’ve got to fix that. For the rest of the 300 million, we’ve got to design an efficient system that follows   logic, where you get to go shop. ” Obamacare has many rules and restrictions governing how the insurance companies structure policies and run their own firms, he said. Lifting the regulatory burden on the insurance industry would free them to innovate, he said, “In the current bill, I’ve asked leadership, budget committee experts: ‘Can a young person go out and buy a health care insurance product of their choosing?’ The answer is no,” he said. The reason is that the regulations on the insurance companies require certain “essential health care benefits,” so that everyone in the country is forced to buy the same coverage, whether they need it or not,” Brat said. In the RyanCare bill, the individual mandate was supposed to go away, but instead, it is reconfigured as a continuing care option tied to the   condition protections, he said. Under Ryancare someone can go without insurance for 10 years and then upon learning they have cancer, sign up for “insurance. ” Brat said the only penalty would be a 30 percent surcharge upon their premiums. “It is a perverse economic system. ” The congressman said nothing makes the politics of the RyanCare bill more plain than the fact that in 2015, Republicans in the House and Senate passed a   repeal of Obamacare  —   when everyone knew it would be vetoed by President Barack Obama. Now with real bullets, Republicans are stepping away from repeal to put forward a RyanCare bill that preserves the structure and spirit of Obamacare. The speaker’s bill is unlikely to pass the House, but even if it makes it to the Senate, it will not pass there, either, Brat said. Then, hopefully, the Republican leadership will work with Capitol Hill conservatives to craft a true repeal of Obamacare that synchs up with what Trump promised the American people, Bratt concluded.",0
20849,Paul Craig Roberts: Trump faces assasination,"Paul Craig Roberts: Trump faces assasination 09.11.2016 | Source: AP Photo 
Donald Trump will be the new President of the United States of America. The Republican won 276 electoral votes with the necessary minimum of 270 votes and he has made himself to the post of the head of the United States. 
Pravda.Ru has turned for a comment to Paul Craig Roberts who is an American economist, journalist, blogger and former civil servant. 
The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. Hillary Clinton, an agent for the oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that both the political establishment of both political parties and the media no longer have credibility with the American people.It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran.It also remains to be seen how the oligarchy will respond to Trump's victory. Wall Street and its agent, the Federal Reserve, can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government.With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment and obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington's orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia's border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end ofWashington's effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these implythe total defeat of the oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the oligarchy still exists and is stillpowerful.Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks tohis view, it means a big political change in Washington's EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia ofthe current EU and NATO officials would have to cease.We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliarwith the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopefulfor the changes that now have a chance. If Trump is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding Wall Street politically accountable, he could be assassinated.

20853,News: Office Of The Future: Researchers Predict That Over 50 Percent Of Workplace Discrimination Will Be Automated By 2040,"Email 
Automation in the workplace can bring new levels of efficiency and employee happiness, but it can also mean that human workers lose their jobs in favor of robotic replacements. No matter your stance on cutting-edge technology in the office, there is no doubt that it’s a swiftly approaching reality. According to a new study released by Stanford University, Americans can expect over 50 percent of all workplace discrimination to be fully automated by 2040. 
The future is coming, and it’s coming fast. 
Thanks to recent advancements in computer intelligence and predictive analytics, it may not be long before you see an automated machine in your office demoting female employees for becoming pregnant. Whether humiliating subordinates with unwanted sexual comments or automatically filtering out résumés from people with Middle Eastern last names, trends in technological development suggest that an increasingly computerized workforce will soon be enforcing inequality in office environments with far greater proficiency and cost-effectiveness than human labor. 
“People think that automated workplace discrimination is still far off in the future, when truthfully it’s right around the corner,” said Stanford computer scientist Dr. Oliver Thorpe, who spearheaded the new study. “We’re already at the point with facial recognition software where it can identify which genders and races should be passed up for leadership roles with far greater accuracy than humans, and technologies like this are only getting better and cheaper by the day.” 
With intelligent algorithms becoming rapidly more sophisticated and capable, virtually every industry can soon expect to begin replacing humans with machines that can oppress minorities, senior citizens, and other subjugated people groups with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. Within 10 years, market-available computers will have the ability to grossly neglect the needs of disabled workers and make them feel like burdens. Within 15 years, roving automatons will travel about open-plan offices smacking female subordinates’ buttocks with their carbon-fiber paddle attachments, adeptly wielding their power in such a way as to avoid consequences. 
Some believe that machines will never be able to fully replicate the complexity and intuitiveness of human on-the-job prejudice, but employers will likely be willing to sacrifice that human touch for the sake of their bottom line. Thorpe notes that maintaining a fucked-up culture of occupational disparity is expensive, and as soon as companies realize that they can enlist semi-autonomous robots to mistreat their employees at a fraction of the cost, they’ll be lining up to install them in offices nationwide. 
Only time will tell whether or not the human workers who have so dutifully carried out discriminatory business practices for decades get laid off or reassigned, but one thing is for sure: The American office is about to look way different.",0

During a press briefing Monday, Fox News correspondent Kevin Corke asked Earnest if he believed Brazile should step down from her position at the DNC should the emails be proven to be hers. 
“No, the president believes she has done a fine job stepping in during a very difficult situation to lead the Democratic Party,” Earnest told reporters . “Look, those of us who have known Donna a long time know that she is a person of integrity and she is a person of high character. She is a true professional who is a tenacious and effective advocate for Democrats.” 
“She uses that skill regularly on television, she has been using that skill regularly as a party official, and I for one am pretty excited about the fact that we’ve got her on our team,” he added. 
Corke asked, “What do you say to those Bernie Sanders backers who feel like the fix was in from the very outset. … If it turns out that she did tip the scales or put her hand on the scale for Secretary Clinton, and didn’t handle it evenly as a member of the leadership of the DNC, that’s OK with you?” Post navigation",0

20859,"Kunduz Attack in November Killed 33 Civilians, U.S. Military Says - The New York Times","KABUL, Afghanistan  —   A United States military investigation into claims of civilian casualties during a joint operation by Afghan and American forces found that 33 civilians were killed and 27 others were wounded during a firefight and airstrikes in Kunduz Province last year, American military officials said on Thursday. In early November, Afghan Special Forces, accompanied by American military advisers, came under intense fire during an operation to arrest Taliban commanders in Boz Qandahari, a village in Kunduz, the United States military command in Afghanistan said in a statement. They called in American airstrikes, which resulted in some of the civilian casualties. Two American soldiers and three Afghan commandos were killed, and four American soldiers and 11 commandos were wounded, the statement said. “Regardless of the circumstances, I deeply regret the loss of innocent lives,” said Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. the commander of United States forces in Afghanistan. “On this occasion, the Taliban chose to hide amongst civilians and then attacked Afghan and U. S. forces. ” “I wish to assure President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan that we will take all possible measures to protect Afghan civilians,” he added, referring to Ashraf Ghani. After the battle in Kunduz, a New York Times reporter counted 22 bodies being brought into the city on the way to the hospital there. Among them were 14 children, four women, two older men and two men of fighting age. They were accompanied by a large group of protesters from Boz Qandahari, the village that was hit. Residents of Boz Qandahari, however, said that the investigation had underestimated the number of civilians killed and that the claim of Taliban firing at the forces from their homes was not true. “My father was a shopkeeper  —   he had a grocery shop close to our house. My brother and I were farmers. We had never had a weapon. I and no one in my family knows how to use a weapon,” said Mohammed Reza, 29, who lost seven family members in the bombing and was stuck in the rubble of their house for hours. “I lost my father, my brother, my brother’s wife, my son and three of my nephews who were between 1 and 7 years old. ” Dad Mohammed, 45, said he was aware of at least 37 killed among his own relatives. “There were no Taliban among us, there was no Taliban in our house. Except for one former Talib, who was disabled and had lost a leg and he was our cousin,” he said. “He was killed along with his father, his wife and five children. His brother was also killed. ” Mr. Mohammed said the Taliban stronghold in the area was obvious, but it was far from the areas that had been bombed. “This was an act of oppression,” he said. “We are also humans. It should be investigated by an international court, and we need to be compensated for our loss. ” Kunduz is also where a United States military gunship mistakenly targeted a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in October 2015, killing at least 42 people and destroying much of the hospital.",0

[In remarks to investors during a Thursday conference call, Stanley Black  Decker CEO James Loree said it just makes “business sense” to move manufacturing back to the U. S. especially given the uncertainty of trade relations with China and Mexico, USA Today reported.  “It’s going to be advisable to have more manufacturing in the U. S.,” Loree added. “We believe this is an excellent opportunity to   and revitalize this legendary brand,” he concluded. Stanley Black  Decker has been slowly increasing jobs in the U. S. for the past several years. Its current level of some 3, 000 workers is already up 800 from 2013. It is not yet known how many more jobs the company will be bringing to the U. S. as a result of its latest announcement. The remarks come after the company announced the impending purchase of the Sears Craftsman tool line for about $900 million after Sears suffered another round of setbacks which will include the closing of at least 150 more stores. Stanley Black  Decker is not alone in a sudden interest in   in the U. S. since the election of Donald J. Trump. Only days ago at the start of the new year, Ford Motors announced it was canceling plans to build new manufacturing facilities in Mexico and will instead   in America. But Ford is only the latest.

The six arrested were: Alicia Cooke, Danil Faust, Alison Kalnik, Ben Quimby, Noah Rahman, and Reverend Jim Vanderweele. Booked on federal charges of obstructing an entrance to a federal building, they were advised they have to each pay a fine of $530 or go before federal court for trial. 
Alicia Cooke, a member of 350 Louisiana , explained why she was willing to be arrested. “To maintain a livable climate, experts estimate that around 80% of existing fossil fuel resources must stay in the ground. At current consumption levels, we need to place an immediate moratorium on new fossil fuel infrastructure projects and we also must scale back on existing projects. The industry and government executives who dismiss our concerns out of hand because we drive fuel-powered vehicles or use air conditioning are missing the point. A transition to a renewable energy economy at the speed required by science will not be easy for any of us. It will take a full-hearted acceptance of climate science and an enormous collective will. But when you look at the climate math, it is quite literally our only choice.” 
Iris Carter of Concerned Citizens of Norco explained why she was there to protect the Gulf. “Oil is killing people. Just look at my own family. I grew up between a Shell refinery and a Shell chemical plant and when my mother and sister got sick, the doctors asked if we lived near pollution. It’s not fair. And now people have to go and fish in the Gulf – after oil companies leave all that mess. Look what they left from the spill that BP did. That was bad. And it’s no better. They keep going out and drilling and spilling in our Gulf. And that’s just not right.” 
Cheri Fotlin of BOLD Louisiana challenged the feds for excluding the public. “The head of BOEM , Abigail Hopper, had promised to come down and meet directly with our communities who continue to be adversely affected by oil production in and along the Gulf. At the last minute, she backed out. Additionally, BOEM recently stopped allowing public participation at point-of-sale lease auctions. At every turn our voices have been oppressed by this federal agency. We deserve to be heard. If she won’t come to us, then we have no choice but to go to BOEM ourselves to make our wishes known. We want protection. We want respect for our lives. No new leases, not here, not anywhere!” 
Four others were arrested in August at the same place and charged with state criminal trespass. Their trial is still pending. 
The group promises to return and escalate their actions to protect the Gulf.",0
20865,Hillary Clinton’s Gun Control Agenda Exposed in WikiLeaks Emails,"  The Daily Sheeple 
There is no doubt about it. Hillary Clinton is after your guns. 
Brian Fallon, national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote in an email dated October 4, 2015 that Clinton intends to stop the “gun show loophole”, meaning all private gun sales, by executive order : 
Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President – universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability . 
Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold. When a lawsuit brought against these manufacturers was found to be frivolous, Clinton made a big fuss about it on Twitter: It's incomprehensible that our laws would protect gun makers over Sandy Hook families. We need to fix this. https://t.co/96uBe92wPi 
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 15, 2016 
In September 1993 during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Hillary Clinton was asked by Senator Bill Bradley if she supported a 25% sales tax on handguns and automatic weapons. She was very clear in her support of taxing guns: 
“I’m all for that. I just don’t know what else we’re going to do to try to figure out how to get some handle on this violence,” said Clinton. “I’m speaking personally, but I feel very strongly about that.” 
In another email exchange dated January 14, 2016, Clinton wrote about using racial division to further her gun control agenda by selectively ignoring occurrences of gun violence that were not racially motivated. For this reason, according to the email, the Clinton campaign did not include the story of Jordan Davis in an essay on gun violence: 
This is great. My edits are attached. The only flag here is that Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably – this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence. Was there another mother in the Chicago meeting where the shooting was NOT racially motivated? If yes, we should use that story instead of Jordan Davis. 
In another email from March 17, we see an exchange about how to attack Donald Trump and a press call with Arizona locals about gun control. When asked about an anti-gun op-ed article by the Clinton Campaign, Chairman John Podesta wrote that he fears blowback from Clinton’s supporters:

20867,Anonymous To Release The 33000 Deleted Hillary E-Mails Starting November 1st,"« Previous - Next » Anonymous To Release The 33000 Deleted Hillary E-Mails Starting November 1st 
The Internet hacking collective Anonymous are said to be behind the enormous hack of emails relating to the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. While it has been claimed in the mainstream media that hackers from within Russia were responsible for the hack, Anonymous have declared that these suspicions are complete without merit. A source from within the group has allegedly provided proof that Anonymous are in possession of the thirty-three thousand deleted emails. It has also been said that they intend to release all of them. 
It has been claimed that the choice to release emails that would force the FBI to open a serious criminal investigation was a deliberate tactic on the part of hackers involved with the shadowy cyber-network. It is believed that the emails relate to the disgraced former politician Anthony Weiner and his sexual propositioning of an underage girl. The nature of Weiner’s crime adds credence to the claims that Anonymous are behind the hack as they have a strong track record in aggressively exposing the crimes of sex offenders. 
The source has claimed that the revelations will not end with Weiner. In the week leading up to the highly contentious presidential election, more emails will be released in batches, each containing sensational details supposedly relating to the criminal activity of those within Clinton’s inner circle. A sneak preview of the revelations that are to suggest that they are potential ground breaking in nature. Apparently, the group has access to documents which attest to serious criminal activities including bribes and threats to both election officials and members of the media. Sources within Anonymous have claimed that these documents will certainly lead to criminal charges being leveled against further individuals within the Democratic Party . 
The group has also given a tantalizing hint about the relationship between the Clinton Foundation, the White House and the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. It is alleged that the emails will show that the Clinton Foundation made a transfer of $1.8 billion to the incredibly wealthy country. There are also allusions to a palace being built there for a ‘high-ranking White House official.' As the group has also claimed that the sitting president Barrack Obama will feature heavily in the upcoming emails, it has been speculated as to whether the president himself is this ‘high ranking White House official.'

20869,Donald Trump Reacts to Egypt Ramadan Terror: ‘The Bloodletting of Christians Must End’ - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump strongly condemned Friday’s terrorist attack on Coptic Christians in Egypt during the first day of Ramadan. [“This merciless slaughter of Christians in Egypt tears at our hearts and grieves our souls,” he said, after terrorists shot at a bus, killing at least 28 people.  Trump again criticized the “depraved, twisted, and thuggish ideology” of terrorists, promising to fight on eliminating them from the world. “The bloodletting of Christians must end, and all who aid their killers must be punished,” he said. Trump vowed that America would help defend historic Christian communities in the Middle East. “Civilization is at a precipice  —   and whether we climb or fall will be decided by our ability to join together to protect all faiths, all religions, and all innocent life,” he said. Earlier today, President     also responded to the attack. “I direct my appeal to President Trump: I trust you, your word and your ability to make fighting global terror your primary task,” he said.",0
20870,TERROR THREAT WARNING MONDAY | RedFlag News,"
CBS NEWS 
NEW YORK -- CBS News has learned about a potential terror threat for the day before the election. 
Sources told CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that U.S. intelligence has alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda could be planning attacks in three states for Monday. 
It is believed New York, Texas and Virginia are all possible targets, though no specific locations are mentioned. 
U.S. authorities are taking the threat seriously, though the sources stress the intelligence is still being assessed and its credibility hasn’t been confirmed. Counterterrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of abundance of caution. 
A senior FBI official told CBS News, “The counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety.” 
Intelligence about potential threats always increases during holiday seasons and when big events are approaching. 
As Election Day nears, federal law enforcement is planning for several worst-case scenarios. 
Earlier this week, an alert warned local police of “polling places” being seen as “attractive targets” for “lone wolf”-type attacks by individuals motivated by violent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity. ",0
20871,Germany Bans Cultivation of GM Crops Under EU Opt-Out Law,"The Netherlands 
Poland 
Germany’s GM ban is significant considering that biotech industry representatives have been trying to keep their stranglehold on the genetically modified crop market in the country. 
The news will likely not be taken well by DuPont Pioneer and Dow Chemical, who have been waiting for an EU executive permit for GMO cultivation in Germany and other EU countries for nearly 15 years. 
Likewise, Monsanto has criticized other member states for using their ‘opt-out’ vote to ban GMOs from their countries, stating that their decisions “contradict science.” 
It was just over six years ago that another EU country, Hungary, strongly enforced their GM ban by destroying 1,000 acres of GM maize that had been found growing illegally. The Hungarians were the very first to take a forceful position in the European Union in relation to the use of transgenic seeds. 
Germany’s GMO ban is doubly important due to the planned merger between the Germany-based Bayer, and U.S.-based Monsanto. With ChemChina-Syngenta and DuPont-Dow Chemical forming their own multi-billion-dollar mergers, consumers and farmers still have a way to refuse genetically modified crops as they are increasingly incorporated into international treaties and trade agreements. 
As agricultural companies continue to consolidate , becoming larger and larger entities with greater capacity to lobby governments in their favor of monopolizing seed markets, the German opt-out sends a clear message to the makers of these seeds. They can grow bloated and powerful but in the end, the people will decide what they eat . 
Bill and Melinda Gates try to convince an EU country to embrace GMOs:",0
20873,The Top Political Tweets and Hashtags of 2016 - The New York Times,"Twitter announced on Tuesday the year’s biggest trending topics and most widely shared tweets in news and politics, and while the election loomed large, several of the most popular discussions were focused on matters of identity and safety. Race relations were at the top of people’s minds, with #BlackLivesMatter the   popular subject. Alton Sterling, a black man fatally shot by the police in Baton Rouge, La. was also in the top 10. #InternationalWomensDay gathered discussion about gender in March, while #LoveIsLove  —   a declaration associated with equal rights for gay people that Barack Obama used as Americans held pride parades  —   was popular in June. Twitter users publicly mourned   attacks with #PrayForOrlando and #PrayForNice, while discussion of Brexit, a coup attempt in Turkey and the Panama Papers also made the top 10. But #Election2016 was the leading discussion of the year and the subject of most of the most widely shared political tweets of the year. The most popular political tweet was a quote from Hillary Clinton’s concession speech on Nov. 9. Ms. Clinton’s tweet was the   popular tweet of the year in any subject, falling behind one by a Spanish video gamer and one from Harry Styles quoting Taylor Swift. And you thought the American election was the most interesting thing that happened this year. The   political tweet might require some explanation. During the campaign, Donald J. Trump posted a criticism of President Obama’s endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. In response, she (or, more likely, her staff) latched on to a common Twitter retort. If you’re still confused, we explained the meme more fully here. Other tweets on the list were more straightforward, such as Mr. Trump’s Election Day declaration, a kind word from a vice president to his pal and an actor responding in despair to the election results. This one came from an everyday user who struck a nerve with a Google search for the name of the current president. Although Mr. Obama sent the tweet below four years ago to celebrate his   it got more than 236, 000 retweets in 2016, Twitter said. That was slightly more retweets than Mr. Trump got this year on an   tweet after winning the election. Last on the list was a tweet that found resonance among Mr. Trump’s opponents.",0
20878,Murder Inc. in the White House; Obama’s Drones for Breakfast Club,"Murder Inc. in the White House; Obama’s Drones for Breakfast Club By Thomas C. Mountain   Thomas C. Mountain 
Elections come and go but when “The Don,” Barack Obama, meets with his inner circle of Capos every Tuesday morning its breakfast with drones as in the Murder Incorporated assassination program. 
Think about it, every Tuesday morning in the White House this breakfast club decides who they are going to blow to smithereens that week, with fresh fruit and cappuccinos all around. 
Does Obama lie in bed on Monday nights deciding who to have assasinated the next day? You think I am joking? I went to the same school as Barack Obama, I know it torments the brother to blow away all those women and children at those village weddings but someone has to protect Pax Americana . . . right? 
Hear it straight from the mouth of Barack in 2012. “Turns out I’m really good at killing people. Didn’t know that was a strong suit of mine.” . 
The criminal absurdity of the right to kill at will without consequence when you head the most powerful military on the planet as the commander in chief seems to be completely lost on the American sheeple. 
As a star basketball player in high school Barry O’Bomber, as he was known, left a life of being the only black kid in an elite school of 3,000 to being amongst black Americans for the first time in his life when he left Hawaii for college on “the continent,” as it is known in the islands. 
Obama spent most of his childhood completely isolated from blacks, had reached early adulthood before having any black friends and then made his career out of being black. Could this explain his sociopathic behavior? 
I suspect “Barry,” as his white grandmother renamed him, must know about Murder Inc., the national crime syndicate headed by Lucky Luciano in the 1930s who met regularly to decide whom to kill. 
Mr. Luciano ended up serving life in a federal prison only to be released to set up the Italian Mafia nationally after WW2 as a part of the CIA’s forerunners plan for murder and mayhem against the Italian Communist Party to prevent them from winning the postwar Italian elections. 
Impunity to kill, it runs in American history and Barack Obama finds himself surprisingly good at it. Breakfast with drones, approving the hit list alongside expressos and bagels, Tuesday morning is still Murder Inc. in the Obama White House.

20879,High School Basketball Player Scores an Amazing 92 Points in One Game - Breitbart,"A California high school basketball player has stunned the sports world with his amazing feat on Tuesday, when he scored a whopping 92 points in a single game. [Playing for Chino Hills High School, LaMelo Ball went on a tear with a drive to score nearly two thirds of all the points his team earned in its February 7   win over Los Osos, according to the Kansas City Star.  The player’s father said LaMelo “went crazy” with a spree of baskets after having already scored 29 points by halftime. @MELOD1P drops 92!! (That’s a Ball Family record) in the @basketball_chhs win over Lososos   final @latsondheimer @SGVNSports pic. twitter.   —   Tommy Kiss (@TomKiss64) February 8, 2017,  Ball’s father also noted that LaMelo’s brother, LiAngelo, is usually the top scoring member of the family but LiAngelo wasn’t playing that night. Still, some folks in the district are unhappy with the amazing feat saying that the Ball brothers are ruining team efforts and turning games into star vehicles. “That’s wrong,” Los Osos coach Dave Smith said. “It goes against everything CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) stands for. The Ball boys are very talented and great players, but it’s embarrassing to high school athletics. I’ve been coaching for 35 years, and we’ve turned high school athletics into individualism. ” “It’s amazing to watch a kid score that many points. But it’s tough to say that’s what CIF athletics is about,” Smith concluded. There is still a   record to beat, though. The high school scoring record is still held by Danny Heater of Burnsville (W. Va.) High School, who scored 135 points in one game back in 1960.  Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
20881,"You’re Fired! Trump Wins Big, Clinton Is Going To Jail","Via Yournewswire 
Let the swamp draining begin. And when the murky stench begins to clear we all know what we will see – a bloated, slimy creature called Hillary Clinton shivering in the shallows. SPONSORED LINKS 
Removed from the corridors of power, she won’t be able to say “I don’t recall” 357 times to FBI investigators and get away with it. Her people won’t be able to plead the fifth every time they are asked an incriminating question. Hillary is going down, and a lot of her cronies are going with her. 
The arrogance of the Democratic establishment in thinking the country would endorse these people is staggering. Podesta, essentially a foreign agent for Saudi Arabia – with a brother, Tony, a Spirit Cooker who is actually on Saudi books as an agent. You can’t make this stuff up. 
And don’t forget Huma Abedin, thrown off the the campaign in a disastrous, scandal-riddled final week, exposed as being lax with national security – and having close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Her only experience prior to employment as a Hillary State Dept aide? 10 years working at a radical Islamic journal with links to jihad. The Democrat campaign was a dumpster fire. Burn, baby, burn. 
The Democratic establishment should never have nominated such a liability for president. The people wanted Bernie Sanders. The DNC should have let the primary election play out democratically, as their name suggests they would. But no, they interfered, suppressed the voice of their people, and forced a flawed, roundly disliked and distrusted candidate into the full glare of a brutal election season. 
On election night the Democratic establishment got the pounding they deserve. 
Never let the mainstream media’s disgraceful collusion with the Clinton campaign be forgotten. May the ignominy live forever. Funneling questions to Clinton so she could defeat her primary rival in debates, colluding with Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta – at his house – to “frame the message” and “frame the race,” lying to the American people about their first amendment rights, attempting to scare the population away from being informed. 
CNN is a PR firm, the propaganda arm of the establishment, not a member of the fourth estate. They have been thoroughly exposed by WikiLeaks in 2016. RIP Clinton News Network. Go to hell. 
Don’t forget about the ongoing FBI investigation into the corrupt Clinton Foundation. When Comey cleared her of wrongdoing this week, he was referring to her email scandal. The less publicized Clinton Foundation investigation is still ongoing. The probe was going to hound her into the White House, but now it’s going to throw her in the jailhouse.",0
20882,North Korea Threatens ’Super-Mighty Preemptive Strike’ to Reduce America to ’Ashes’,"In the latest installment in North Korea’s   stream of murderous threats, the official newspaper of the Workers’ Party said a North Korean preemptive strike would annihilate both South Korea and the continental United States. [“In the case of our   preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U. S. imperialists’ invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U. S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,” wrote the Rodong Sinmun newspaper.  Reuters notes that North Korea “regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no   in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang. ” Also, the North Koreans are characteristically incensed by the current round of U. S.  Korean military exercises, an aerial training program called “Max Thunder,” which is scheduled to run through April 28. North Korea always denounces training exercises involving America, South Korea, and other allies, portraying them as practice sessions for a   invasion and sometimes even as the first stage of an invasion disguised as a training exercise. Pyongyang’s rhetoric might be as barbaric as ever, but its actions suggest pressure from the U. S. and China has forced the Kim regime to back away from further provocations, at least temporarily. The analysts who were concerned about an imminent nuclear test at the   test site, timed to coincide with last weekend’s North Korean state holiday celebrations, now report satellite imagery that shows several volleyball games being played at the site. Three volleyball courts are up and running, with a fourth apparently under construction. The analysts at watchdog group 38 North note that the volleyball games could be a deception, and the site remains capable of conducting a nuclear test at any time. U. S. intelligence agencies are working to establish just how serious China is about the North Korean crisis. A U. S. defense official told CNN that China put its cruise   bombers on “high alert” on Wednesday and appears to be conducting intense maintenance on a large number of military aircraft. CNN’s source believed China is making an effort to “reduce the time to react to a North Korea contingency. ” Russia has also moved troops and military equipment to the North Korean border, possibly to prepare for a wave of refugees after military hostilities or the collapse of the Kim regime.",0

20886,Even Penguins Have Children Who Won’t Leave the Nest - The New York Times,"Galápagos penguin chicks have it good. Even when they are old enough to hunt on their own, they beg their parents for food  —   and the parents give in. Recently researchers in the Galápagos watched as fully fledged birds squeaked and pleaded until their parents turned to them and regurgitated a meal into their mouths. One big young bird, recorded on video, was fed, then followed his parent squeaking for more until the besieged adult escaped by diving into the water. The study is online in The Wilson Journal of Ornithology. In the Galápagos, food supplies vary. When times are good and there is plenty of food, one way of assuring the survival of the species is for parents to help their adult children with some extra nourishment. Galápagos penguins forage just offshore, close to their nests, and return to the nest site after the young fledge, so parents and fledglings are likely to encounter one another frequently. Only one other of the 18 species of penguins is known to do this: the Gentoo penguins. These birds, which inhabit Antarctica and nearby islands, feed their young after they have fledged for about 12 days, probably to give them time to learn how to hunt for themselves. The Galápagos penguins, the only penguins that live north of the Equator, are endangered, with fewer than 2, 000 left in the world. They are not always so  . “When conditions are good, they can raise two chicks in a season and continue to feed them,” said Dee Boersma, a professor of biology at the University of Washington and the lead author of the study. “When there’s little food around,” Professor Boersma continued, “they save themselves, forgetting about both eggs and chicks. ”",0

20893,How to Save the Conversation at Your Post-Election Thanksgiving Dinner,"Sometimes going home for the holidays is hard (there’s a reason liquor sales swell during these occasions!). Often, Thanksgiving dinners bring far-flung family members together at a single table under one roof, and that, even in the best of circumstances, can lead to stress and awkward conversations. Add in the fact that this is an election year and you’re bound to encounter some strain while you pass those mashed potatoes across vastly different ideologies. I’ve heard from more than one friend or family member that they won’t be attending holiday dinners this year, and I think that’s really a shame.
I’d encourage anyone thinking about going that route to reconsider; the following tips can help to make your Thanksgiving dinner manageable and enjoyable and can help you focus on your families’ similarities, rather than differences.
Remember the Golden Rule of Polite Conversation If you’re an activist of any sort this may be difficult to adhere to, but the two topics that are best to leave on the coat hook are your religious and political views. Remember last year when Uncle Joe successfully convinced everyone at the table to convert to his exact religious and political beliefs? Yeah, that didn’t happen. No matter how zealous your convictions, if you truly want to make the two hours of Thanksgiving dinner comfortable, you need to skip that kind of talk. Now is no time to be passive-aggressive either: leave the political-themed hats and t-shirts at home. Focus instead on the personal: how people are doing in their jobs, what hobbies they are participating in, how their kids are doing.
If someone tries to bait or lead you into a conversation that approaches one of the two danger zones, be nice but don’t engage. I once escaped a horrible conversation with a distant cousin by complimenting her earrings. Really, this is no different than abstaining from talk about your digestive issues or the road kill you saw on the drive over—it’s just plain rude to go there. And if your family happens to all hold the exact same beliefs and convictions, well, how nice for you! (Though you should know that for years my family assumed I shared their same political opinions when I absolutely did not—consider this might be the case for the person next to you at the table.)
Thankful for Place Settings When I host Thanksgiving dinner at my house, each place setting has a little piece of paper with the subject heading “I am thankful for:” and 5 blank lines. I also give out fountain pens like these as a little gift to my guests. As everyone is seated, they fill out their lists. We take turns over the course of the dinner reading our lists. This is a great way to focus on what really matters to us and to help us share in our gratitude.
Do Your Part Preparation is key in all situations, so having a couple of talking points in your conversation arsenal is smart. Avoid lulls in conversation by contributing. Think about something positive or meaningful that happened to you recently—a beautiful place that you visited or a great (non-political!) book or movie that you saw—and have an anecdote ready.
When all else fails, you can always talk about the food: what your favorite part of the meal is, how certain dishes were prepared, and how good the wine is (but go easy on the wine!).

20897,Russia Moves to Soften Domestic Violence Law - The New York Times,"MOSCOW  —   Russian lawmakers on Wednesday moved to decriminalize some forms of domestic battery for   offenders who do not do serious physical harm to their victims. Members of the State Duma passed the controversial amendment to the Russian criminal code in its second reading, which essentially assures it will go to President Vladimir V. Putin for his signature. The amendment treats a first conviction for domestic battery as an administrative offense, carrying a penalty of a $500 fine or 15 days in jail. If Mr. Putin signs the measure into law, only injuries like concussions or broken bones, or repeated offenses committed in a family setting, would lead to criminal charges. Defenders of the measure say it will protect parents’ rights to discipline their children and generally reduce the state’s role in domestic life. “In the traditional Russian family culture, relations between ‘fathers and sons’ are built upon the authority of parents’ power, mutual love and personal indispensability as the basis for children’s upbringing,” said Yelena B. Mizulina, one of the initiators of the new legislation and author of a law that banned “gay propaganda” aimed at minors. Opponents called it a step back to medieval times and a license for violent behavior by domestic tyrants. “It is clear that lawmakers recognized violence as a norm of family life,” said Svetlana G. Aivazova, a Russian specialist in gender studies. “This shows that Duma deputies are not simply conservative or traditional, it shows that they are archaic. ” Ms. Aivazova and other experts say that Russia has a serious problem with domestic violence. Citing data provided by Russia’s Interior Ministry, Ms. Aivazova told Mr. Putin in 2015 that “40 percent of all grave violent crimes are committed in families. ” In 2013, she said, more than 9, 000 women died in criminal assaults and more than 11, 000 were badly injured. In 2014, she said, “more than 25 percent of all murders were committed in families. ” In the United States, by comparison, 11, 766 women were killed by a husband or boyfriend in the years 2001 to 2012, an average of about 1, 000 a year in a country with about twice the population of Russia. Ms. Aivazova asked Mr. Putin to support a special law on the prevention of domestic violence that had already been passed in 143 countries, including Russia’s   neighbors Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Mr. Putin thanked her, but the law remained in the State Duma, and Ms. Aivazova said she was not optimistic about its prospects. In the past, Mr. Putin has expressed concern about domestic violence, even in the absence of serious injury. “I think we should not slap children and justify it based on some old traditions,” he told journalists at his last news conference in December. “There is a short distance from slaps to beating. ” The new legislation was pushed by conservative members of the Russian parliament and the Russian Orthodox Church, who were incensed last summer when lawmakers criminalized domestic violence, acting upon a recommendation by the Supreme Court. The Russian Orthodox Church, which has steadily increased its influence in social policy in recent years, said in a statement last year that physical punishment was a Russian tradition and thus should be protected as “an essential right given to parents by God. ” “There is absolutely no doubt that children should be defended against true criminal activities,” the church said. “But you cannot equate such criminal assaults with rational and moderate use of physical punishment by loving parents. ” Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, said the new legislation was a sign of the state’s determination to “make conditions for strong families to emerge. ”",0
20900,Reuters: Vice Admiral Harward Trump Pick for National Security Adviser - Breitbart,"(Reuters) The Trump administration has offered the job of White House national security adviser, vacated by former U. S. intelligence official Michael Flynn, to Vice Admiral Robert Harward, said two U. S. officials familiar with the matter on Wednesday. [It was not immediately clear if Harward, a former deputy commander of U. S. Central Command who has Navy SEAL combat experience, had accepted the offer, according to sources.  A White House spokesperson had no immediate comment. Flynn resigned on Monday after revelations that he had discussed U. S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before President Donald Trump took office. Read the full story at Reuters.  ",0
20901,Former GOP Representative Calls For Armed Insurrection (VIDEO),"Former GOP Representative Calls For Armed Insurrection (VIDEO) By Carrie MacDonald on October 27, 2016 
Former Representative Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) has called for armed insurrection if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wins the election. Walsh: ‘I’m Grabbing My Musket’ 
Joe Walsh is a stain on the history of my little part of the country. He served for a blessedly short time before being demolished by Representative Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) in the 2012 election, but he still has ardent supporters around here. He’s relatively well-known for his outrageous tweets, but this one, posted on October 26, made some real waves: On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Wow. 
I will grant that a musket is not going to do you much good these days. So perhaps, PERHAPS, it was a metaphor. 
But what does this say to the droves of Trump supporters, armed with much more than a musket, who believe the election will be stolen from their anointed one? 
Walsh, facing both harsh criticism and hilarious jabs on Twitter for his comment, did not back down: I'm serious. I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right. https://t.co/ThJPEbALWZ 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Yahoo! News interviewed Walsh about the comment, and he said : “I’m not talking about inciting violence. I’m saying, ‘If Trump loses, man, game on, grab your musket. We’re going to protest. We’re going to boycott. We’re going to picket. We’re going to march on Washington. We’re going to stop paying taxes. We’re going to practice civil disobedience.’ Whatever it takes.” 
This has become the standard operating procedure of Republicans, particularly Trump-supporting Republicans. Make veiled threats and then walk them back (“Aww, c’mon, I was kidding! Can’t you guys take a joke?”), but make sure the knuckle-draggers who support them get wind of it. It’s disgusting. 
This morning, Walsh tweeted: I told Thomas Jefferson gov forced a baker out of biz for defending her religious beliefs. 
""Can't happen here"" he said. ""Grab your musket!"" 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 27, 2016 
While this tweet is asinine on so many levels, it also suggests that he wasn’t speaking metaphorically in his initial tweet. After all, in Jefferson’s time, muskets were one of the weapons of choice. Walsh Is A Disgrace 
Language like this has no place in political discourse. If Walsh were nothing more than the radio host he currently is, it would be disgusting. Given that he used to be a representative in the United States Congress, it is downright abhorrent. 
It’s also not the first time Walsh has suggested violence. 
After the shooting of several police officers in Dallas this summer, Walsh tweeted — and later deleted — the following: Screenshot via Chicago Tribune 
So it’s really not out of the question to think he’s actually looking to incite violence with his “grabbing my musket” comment. 
I’m just happy his Congressional office is no longer sullying the quaint town square. 
Watch Don Lemon take Walsh to task for his Dallas tweet here:

20902,"VIDEO: Three Suspected Attackers Beat, Rob Man in Broad Daylight in Philadelphia - Breitbart","Three suspected attackers robbed and beat a man in broad daylight on a Philadelphia sidewalk, according to surveillance footage released by the Philadelphia police.[  Police are still searching for the three male suspects, who are shown in the video attacking and robbing the    victim as he left a restaurant where he was looking for a job, the Daily Mail reported. The attack took place around 12:30 p. m. in Philadelphia’s Kensington neighborhood on the 3500 block of B Street. “It hits really hard when you see something with that level of brutality, and what appears to be that random looking, and again in broad daylight conditions. It does get a little startling,” police Captain Sekou Kinebrew told WPVI. The three suspected attackers can be seen peering into storefront windows before the assault, when one of the men wearing a cast on his right arm appears to signal to the other two men as he’s looking into one of the windows. The other two males turn around, as the victim exits the restaurant. The victim told WTXF that he was stopping by the restaurant to pick up a job application. Suddenly, the three attackers knock him to the ground, beating him and stomping on him until he became unconscious. Meanwhile, one of the attackers went through his pocket and stole his money, wallet, and cell phone. Police say they are unsure of whether the victim knew his attackers. The victim was taken to a hospital where he was treated for a broken nose and orbital bone and then released. Police say the suspects include a black or Hispanic male with a scruffy beard and mustache, wearing a black hat, black coat, and black sweatpants a Hispanic male with a light complexion, bushy hair, wearing a red hooded sweatshirt, red pants, and red sneakers and a   Hispanic male with a beard and mustache, a cast on his right arm, tattoos on both arms, wearing a white   black pants, and red sneakers.

20911,Nate Terani: One Veteran's War on Islamophobia,"  
Recently, I was asked a question about Kill Anything That Moves , my history of civilian suffering during the Vietnam War. An interviewer wanted to know how I responded to veterans who took offense at the (supposed) implication that every American who served in Vietnam committed atrocities. 
I think I softly snorted and slowly shook my head. 
Already two books behind me, Kill Anything That Moves might as well have been written by someone else in another lifetime. In some sense, it was. 
It takes effort for me to dredge up the faded memories of that work, a Kodachrome-hued swirl of hundreds of interviews on two continents over the course of a decade. But this particular question was easy enough to answer. Almost all the Americans I interviewed had seen combat, but most American veterans of the war hadn’t. Many had little or no real opportunity to commit war crimes. Case closed. 
But that question caused me to recall a host of related queries that churned around the book. Questions by skeptics, atrocity-deniers, fair-minded interviewers attempting to play devil’s advocate. A favorite was whether the book was “anti-veteran.” That, too, was a head-shaker for me. 
“How could that be?” I would respond. After all, the book owed its genesis to veterans. Veterans were key sources for it. Veterans provided the evidence. Veterans provided the quotes. Veterans even supplied the title. The book was, to a great extent, the history of the war as described to me by veterans. The story I told was their story. How could that in any way be anti-veteran? 
Many of the vets I spoke with viewed their truth-telling as a form of patriotism, of continuing service to country. Nate Terani’s inaugural TomDispatch essay follows in the same American tradition. His eyes were opened to the abuse of military power while living in Iran as a boy. Later he would join the U.S. Navy and wear the stars and stripes with particular pride. September 11th and all that came after — notably the demonization of his Muslim faith in his homeland — imbued him with a new mission, one he now views as no less sacred than his military service. 
From Smedley Butler to Andrew Bacevich , Daniel Ellsberg to Chelsea Manning , Vietnam Veterans Against the War to Iraq Veterans Against the War , the U.S. armed forces have produced a steady stream of truth-tellers and whistleblowers, men and women willing to serve their country in profound ways during trying times. There’s no bronze star for activism, no Navy Cross for unpopular or contrarian opinions, no Purple Heart for the hard knocks involved in speaking out against war crimes or Islamophobia or laying bare information vital to the American public. Veterans who dare to do so have sometimes walked a cold, lonely road far from the warm glow enjoyed by summer soldiers and sunshine patriots. Those who do so exhibit a special form of courage that may even exceed the bravery of the battlefield, the courage to stand tall and make oneself a target, a courage deserving ( with a nod to Thomas Paine ) of the love and thanks of man and woman.",0
20912,POLLAK: Adm. Mike Mullen’s Partisan Attack on Steve Bannon - Breitbart,"Admiral Mike Mullen served the United States with the greatest distinction, serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. [His attack in Monday’s New York Times on White House adviser (and former Breitbart News chair) Steve Bannon, however, does a disservice to the public policy debate about national security strategy.  Adm. Mullen objects to Bannon’s appointment to the National Security Council (NSC). He admits, however, that President Bush’s NSC “was arranged similarly to Mr. Trump’s,” albeit with the exclusion of political guru Karl Rove. He also admits President Obama included his own political adviser, David Axelrod, in NSC meetings  —   even though Axelrod had no military or foreign policy experience whatsoever (and close ties to the   left and Chicago’s corrupt Democratic machine). In addition, Adm. Mullen complains about “Mr. Bannon’s troubling public positions. ” Adm.  does not list which positions he means  —   hoping, perhaps, that the false innuendos of mainstream media attacks will fill in the blanks for the Times‘ readers. USA Today recently reviewed hundreds of hours of Bannon’s radio commentaries and found none of the racism, antisemitism or “white nationalism” that the Times, among others, falsely ascribed to him. All it found was that Bannon worried about the threats posed by Islam and China. Those are threats most Americans also take seriously  —   and which, presumably, Adm. Mullen did as well. Where Adm. Mullen’s argument really begins to take on water is when he worries that Bannon’s presence would disrupt what is supposed to be a “nonpartisan” institution. It is hard to imagine a more partisan security apparatus than that which emerged on Adm. Mullen’s watch, when the military undertook   changes such as the end of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. ” And though generals asked for more troops in Afghanistan, the president gave them less than they needed  —   along with a   timeline that ended, conveniently, in time Obama’s  . And the disastrous 2011 pullout from Iraq flew in the face of Adm. Mullen’s own recommendation to Congress, in 2007, that success required a   commitment there. Bannon’s official job title is not political adviser, but “Chief Strategist. ” That undoubtedly involves some political advice, but it also points to a role in maintaining the coherence of Trump administration policies. That is crucial in a White House led by a political outsider with a   mandate for change. Bannon’s own naval experience, and his immersion in history and foreign policy, qualify him for the role. And speaking as his former colleague at Breitbart News, I can testify to his   in moments of crisis. I feel more secure knowing Steve is advising our president  —   and I believe others should, as well. In a “disruptive” presidency, he is a stabilizing influence, as he was on the campaign trail. President Trump seems to agree. Adm. Mullen says he worries about “a blurring of presidential responsibilities  —   Republican Party leader and commander in chief. ” But the Constitution recognizes no such distinction, and the time for worrying about that began in January 2009, when for the first time, the U. S. military was led by a    who placed his own political fortunes ahead of the safety and security of the American people. The morning after the Benghazi attacks in 2012, for example, President Obama flew to Las Vegas for a political fundraiser. None of his predecessors  —   not even President Jimmy Carter  —   would have done that. President Trump, like his predecessors, deserves to choose his team, and a leader of Adm. Mullen’s stature should not lend his name to partisan and evidently misinformed attacks. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

20914,Elizabeth Warren: ‘We Need a Justice Department Not an Obstruction of Justice Department’ - Breitbart,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) used her time at the podium giving a commencement speech at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to slam the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding President Donald’s Trump decision to fire James Comey as FBI director and the Department of Justice’s effort to replace him.[  Warren asked the graduates to become activists for causes and named a few, including animal rescue,   care and “bullying. ” Then she attacked her political opponents, saying, “I can’t help myself. ” “And I have one more: the principle that no one in this country is above the law  —   and we need a justice department not an obstruction of justice department,” Warren said. Warren also told the graduates that big corporations and the wealthy are trying to “fundamentally change” the country and it is up to them to stop it. “Your elected officials are increasingly working only for the few  —   the very wealthy few,” Warren said. “And they are setting policies only to benefit the few  —   the very wealthy few. And if that doesn’t change then this country will fundamentally change. “It is your world, your future that is on the line,” Warren said. Warren also made several references to drinking alcohol during her speech, including mentioning a drinking game named for her, during her   speech. “I understand that every extra minute I speak is that much longer before you can hit the bars,” Warren said. Fortune magazine previewed Warren’s speech by noting that she was on TIME magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world this year and included the statement by the university’s Chancellor Kumble R. Subbaswamy, who called the senator “a strong role model for students. ” “We are inspired by her staunch advocacy for equitable access to education, environmental resource conservation and support for economic justice,” Subbaswamy said in a statement. “These issues are in alignment with our campus’s core values and our long history of activism in pursuit of social justice. ” “At UMass Amherst we stand for the hopes, the ambitions, the bold experiments and the innovative solutions of the people of Massachusetts and the world beyond,” Subbaswamy said. “We share Sen. Warren’s commitment to making a profound, transformative contribution to the common good. ”",0
20915,"White House Calls for Deep Cuts to Taxes on Families, Individuals, and Businesses - Breitbart","President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed deep changes to federal taxes, including sharp cuts in both individual and business taxes and the elimination of the estate tax. [The proposal reduces the number of individual income tax brackets to three —  10 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. It would double the standard deduction, effectively eliminating federal income taxes on the first $24, 000 of a couple’s income. It also calls for the elimination of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. The White House also said that families would receive a break for child care expenses.  As a result of these changes, the tax burden on most Americans would be reduced under the plan. The Trump administration would eliminate most itemized tax deductions except for the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations. Notably, taxpayers would not be able to deduct state and local taxes, which hurts residents of   states such as New York and California. Lower tax rates, however, make these deductions less valuable. The corporate tax rate would fall to 15 percent from 35 percent. In addition, U. S. companies would owe little or no tax on future profits earned outside the U. S. putting the U. S. on a territorial tax system similar to those employed in most developed countries. Business income reported on individual returns would also drop to 15 percent, a change that would benefit many small businesses. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economics adviser Gary Cohn set forth the framework at a White House press conference on Wednesday. The proposals bear a strong resemblance to those set forth by the Trump campaign last year. Many details will still have to be worked out and negotiated with Congress. The proposal did not go into specifics about the child care credit, for example. Nor did it spell out how stockpiled foreign earnings of U. S. companies would be treated if repatriated.",0
20918,Charles Koch Makes Massive Donation to Historically Black Colleges - Breitbart,"Billionaire Charles Koch, who is a frequent conservative political donor, has made a massive contribution to historically black colleges across the United States. [Through the Koch Foundation, Charles Koch donated $25. 6 million to historically black colleges for the purpose of conducting research on criminal justice and entrepreneurship in cities plagued by high crime.  “Education transformed my life, and I’ve committed to do all I can to give others that same opportunity,” Koch said in a statement Wednesday evening. The Marshall fund has made that same commitment, he said, “giving students and scholars the chance to discover new ways to overcome barriers holding too many people back. As they succeed, so does our society. ” The donation was made to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, which benefits students at 47 universities including Howard University, the University of the District of Columbia, Bowie State, and Morgan State, all of which are historically black institutions. Liberals in academia are concerned about Koch money flowing to their universities. Ralph Wilson of Tallahassee,   of a group called UnKoch My Campus, claims that these donations were made so that the Koch brothers can have more control over curriculum and activism at the receiving institutions. “When they give the donor control, the   is academic freedom,” Wilson argued. Despite these claims, Brian Hooks, the president of the Koch foundation, maintains that the donations are not political in nature. “Our commitment across the board with all of our grants  …     is to open inquiry,” Hooks said in an interview Tuesday. “We’re looking to support great  scholars. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about social justice and libertarian issues for Breitbart News.

20920,Democratic Congressman Threatens Violence If GOP Tries To Defund Planned Parenthood | Daily Wire,"Democratic Congressman Threatens Violence If GOP Tries To Defund Planned Parenthood By: Hank Berrien November 21, 2016 
The Democratic congressman who is challenging House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, threatened a “Youngstown street fight” if Donald Trump attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. 
Speaking with Jake Tapper on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Ryan intimated that defunding Planned Parenthood wasn’t the only stimulus he would need to launch violence. He stated, “If he tries to defund Planned Parenthood, if he tries to kick people off their health insurance, if they try to privatize Medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy, you know, we are going to have a Youngstown street fight in the Capitol.” 
Youngstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past; last May and August violence erupted on the streets of the city. 
Ryan called Trump’s infrastructure plan “a bunch of smoke and mirrors.” He added that he didn’t blame Pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues: “I can’t in good conscience hang this election around Nancy Pelosi’s neck, of course. But, moving forward, we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for Donald Trump, even in my district, where they voted for me and they voted for Donald Trump.” 
Ryan’s campaign to replace Pelsoi is picking up steam; on Sunday, New York Rep. Kathleen Rice endorsed him, stating, ""He has a lot of good ideas, but maybe most importantly, he also isn’t suggesting he has all the answers — he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing, that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy,"" Rice said in a statement.

20921,Marine Le Pen Hails ’Extremely Positive’ Dutch Elections,"Despite Dutch   migration politician Geert Wilders coming second in the Dutch national elections this week, French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen called the result “extremely positive”. [Earlier this week, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) under the leadership of   politician Geert Wilders came second in the national elections. Many in politics including Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the media claimed Wilders coming second means the end of the populist movement sweeping Europe.  French   migration presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has firmly disagreed, Tiroler Tageszeitung reports. Ms. Le Pen called the result which saw the PVV increase its seats in the parliament “extremely positive”. The vote also led to the total collapse of the Dutch Labour party which went from 25 per cent of the vote in 2012 to only 6 per cent, losing the majority of its seats in the parliament. “I would have been disappointed if he had slipped or stagnated, but he has risen and the parties in power have fallen heavily,” Le Pen noted. Le Pen, who leads the French Front National, is also an MEP and a member of the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group along with the PVV and several other populist parties across Europe. “For Wilders this is extremely positive, which is the proof of the reach of our joint ideas in the different European countries,” she added. In six weeks, Marine Le Pen will head to her own election fight as the first round of the French presidential elections approaches. Le Pen has maintained a steady lead in polling for weeks for the first round and is currently at around 28 per cent according to polls released Friday. France, Opinion Way poll: Le Pen ( ): 28% ↑Macron ( *): 25%Fillon ( ): 20% ↑Hamon ( ): 13%  …     https:  .   —   Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) March 17, 2017,  Le Pen is running on a platform of   migration,   and has said that she will pursue a course that would see the French leave the euro and reinstate the Franc as well as potentially leave the European Union altogether. The Front National leader is expected to face Emmanuel Macron in the second round in May as conservative Republican candidate François Fillon has been tarred by financial scandals involving fake jobs for his family members. Initially, Macron was seen as easily defeating Le Pen as early    polls gave him a substantial lead. Since then, Le Pen has been closing the gap between her and Macron with latest polling showing that the difference is approaching single digits.

20922,Vox Editor: 'I Have Written There's 0 Evidence The Clinton Foundation Was Used For Personal Family Enrichment. Looks Like I Was Wrong' | RedFlag News,"
Jeff Stein | VOX 
Hillary Clinton found herself in a no-win dilemma as she moved to launch her presidential run while also aiding her husband’s globe-trotting philanthropy — and her team knew it. 
Sometime before announcing her candidacy, Clinton had agreed to go to a Clinton Global Initiative fundraiser in Morocco planned for May 2015. The king of Morocco had personally pledged to give $12 million with the understanding she’d attend, according to emails released last week by WikiLeaks. 
But then there was the awkward fact that Clinton would be running for president by then. That set up a bind: Go to the event, and Clinton would be appearing to indulge a foreign government known for egregious human right abuses to help her family’s private charity. Pull out, and Clinton would be going back on her word to the Moroccan king. 
“The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting. It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months,” Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote in an email in November 2014, several months before Clinton declared her candidacy. “She created this mess.” 
Hillary Clinton ultimately decided against attending, and Chelsea Clinton and Bill Clinton went instead. (Politico has reported a Moroccan phosphate export firm gave “at least” $1 million, but it’s not clear if the other $11 million came through. The foundation doesn’t have to disclose the gift and has declined to confirm one way or another to reporters.) 
But since this story broke late last week, Clinton has been getting attacked for it far and wide. And this time it’s not just Donald Trump and Fox News: Even mainstream outlets like the Atlantic and the Associated Press have published tough pieces about the controversy. (The Huffington Post said it amounted to a “brutal, clean hit” on the Democratic nominee.) 
This controversy has stoked wildly misleading allegations implying that Clinton is corrupt, even in some leading news outlets. But while those claims are overblown, the story still illustrates how the foundation helped put wealthy donors into Clinton’s orbit — and allowed them to buy a rare chance to shape her perspective that few average Americans will ever get.

20923,Hamas Sentences Two Palestinians to Death for Drug Smuggling,"GAZA CITY (PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES) (AFP)  —    A Hamas military court on Sunday sentenced two Palestinians to death for drug smuggling in the Gaza Strip, in the first punishment of its kind in the enclave. [“The Gaza military court announced the death penalty for two civilians from Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, for selling narcotics,” the   interior ministry said in a statement.  It said a third suspect was sentenced to hard labour. Authorities have seized drugs with a street value of around $1 million (900, 000 euros) over the past few months, the ministry said. They seized 1, 250 packets of cannabis and 400 pills of Tramadol  —   a powerful   painkiller  —   in January alone, it said. Until Sunday, only people guilty of spying for Israel or murder had received the death penalty in Gaza, controlled by Islamist Hamas since 2007. All Palestinian death sentences in theory have to be approved by president Mahmoud Abbas, but Hamas has long refused to accept his legitimacy. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) said Sunday’s sentences were a “serious precedent” and that bringing civilians before a military court was a breach of Palestinian law. It said that one of the two men was condemned to death by hanging and the other was to hang. The PCHR said in an   statement that to carry out the sentences would be “  killing, and those (who) participated or contributed to issuing them should be held accountable on grounds of   killing and abuse of power”. “Applying this penalty in drugs cases is very dangerous, particularly in absence of fair trial guarantees and presence of many reports exposing widespread use of torture during the interrogation period, especially in drugs crimes,” it added. The centre said that around a dozen death sentences have been passed down in Gaza since the start of 2017.",0

Trump admitted that his call was “very, very direct,” but essential for keeping the alliance together. “We have to make up for the many years lost,” Trump said. “Two percent is the bare minimum for confronting today’s very real and very vicious threats. ” He also alluded to the cost of the new NATO headquarters building, suggesting that it was another expense shouldered by the American taxpayer. “I never asked once what the new NATO headquarters cost, I refuse to do that, but it is beautiful,” he said.",0
20926,Anthony Weiner’s Alleged Teenaged Sexting Victim Pens SCATHING Open Letter To FBI Director Comey,"Anthony Weiner’s Alleged Teenaged Sexting Victim Pens SCATHING Open Letter To FBI Director Comey 786 Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
With just a little over a week to go before election day, FBI Director James Comey took it upon himself to blatantly interfere with the process. 
During a probe into Anthony Weiner’s sexting scandal, the FBI supposedly uncovered emails that may or may not (probably not) have something to do with Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, for which she has already been exonerated. Comey sent a vague letter to congress which he KNEW would start a shit-storm in the media, and now the race is closer than ever. And here Trump complains about a “rigged” election! 
Unfortunately, while attempting to sway voters, Comey didn’t consider that there was someone else at the center of this — Anthony Weiner’s victim, who is only 16 years old. 
She was understandably upset and had a few words to say to the FBI director. You can read the entire letter on BuzzFeed , but here are a few excerpts: 
I am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators. 
Your letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn’t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me. 
… 
I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters’ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. 
Anthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my “story” the goal of every reporter? 
She signs the letter with, “Girl that lost faith in America.” 
And that coming from a girl who is barely starting her life, but who is also approaching voting age is heartbreaking.

20928,Hillary Clinton has a deep commitment.,"(7 fans) - Advertisement - 
Hillary Clinton is very sincere and is committed to economy, employment, refugees, immigration and health reforms as a means of making lasting change in the US and in the world. Now we need to take concrete action and not waste time in rhetoric. Hillary Clinton is committed to build an infrastructure of education, employment, health care, small business, free press, electrical power, communications and transportation. Hillary Clinton has a deep commitment. She is active in our educational and development community, include her involvement with the government and with leaders. She played an important role in offering outreach to the people including women and children. We must vote for her. We should remember that the first condition for economic reforms is good leaders, and employment. Good leaders and employment opportunities are necessary not only for the economic growth but also for the security, physical well being and psychological comfort of the American citizens. US has always been demonstrated a decent and sustained growth rate because of a fully functioning democratic system. The pillars of the US democratic system include regular elections, peaceful transfer of power, American people's involvement in all development programs, and a reliable power among the states. This has enabled US to pursue a policy of economic liberalization, massive educational improvement and of providing a solid investment in a long-term perspective. Yes, US still suffers from unemployment, and faces challenges; these problems seem solvable soon. US needs to establish and implement long-term policies of economic growth. It should also create a well-organized and comprehensive development vision that all the political leaders should agree to follow. Making appropriate investments in our roads, electrification, and extension services would help considerably in improving Americans lives. Increasing investment in basic education and health care are important in ensuring that the poor participate meaningfully in the economic growth. A lack of education and health care hurts the poor today. And finally, President Hillary Clinton must focus on generating high rates of sustainable growth while ensuring that the benefits of that growth is spread to all parts of states. As we know, the solutions are the same everywhere, have a society based on equity and justice for everyone. - Advertisement - As we know, most countries do the opposite. Discrimination against women and children today is as bad as decades ago. It's always the issue of the privileged not caring, the poor get hurt and people of color and women especially get hurt the most. Thus, vote for Hillary Clinton, because the role of the leaders is more important and they can assist people's movements for economic growth. - Advertisement -",0
20930,(VIDEO) Female College Students Protesting Because ‘Trump is a Rapist’,"
21st Century Wire says… 
US college students continue to be emotionally traumatized and ‘threatened’ by Donald Trump’s surprise presidential victory this week, sparking a wave of nationally coordinated street protests, organized in part through the George Soros funded Democratic Party ‘community organizing’ web portal MoveOn.org . 
Various protests and riots have been organized around a number university campuses including Berkeley, Portland, New York City and Los Angleses. 
When asked why she scared by the election result, one female university student claimed that the President Elect is a “rapist,” while another claim that, “He [Trump] is about to have a court case about a 13 years old girl soon, and I’m not down for that.” 
The alleged court case the student is referring was actually dropped , and has since been exposed as a likely politically motivated hoax according to reports . 
Here is last night’s student protest, including multiple interviews from both sides of the debate, filmed last night in Albuquerque, New Mexico, by Stuart J Hooper . Watch:

20933,‘Moana’ Has the Second Best Thanksgiving Weekend Opening of All Time - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   With the   of “Moana” over the holiday weekend, the reinvigorated Walt Disney Animation Studios cemented its status as  ’s reigning powerhouse for   films. “Moana,” one of the   wide releases of the year, collected about $81. 1 million at domestic theaters over the   holiday weekend, enough to rank as the   Thanksgiving opening on record, behind only “Frozen,” which took in $93. 6 million for Disney in 2013. (Disney Animation Studios and its corporate sibling, Pixar, now hold the top six spots on that Thanksgiving records list.) Costing at least $300 million to make and market worldwide, “Moana” took in an additional $16. 3 million in limited overseas release, including in China, where the response was muted. “Moana,” which navigated various controversies en route to theaters, including one over an   Halloween   and one over an oversize male character, is a   musical   Miranda, the virtuoso behind the Broadway smash “Hamilton,” contributed to the score. After a fallow period in the 2000s, when Pixar reigned supreme, Disney Animation Studios has delivered one successful original film after another, including “Tangled,” “Frozen,” “  Ralph” and, earlier this year, “Zootopia. ” Pixar, lately focused more intently on sequels, has recently had an uneven track record with originals, finding a blockbuster in “Inside Out” but fizzling with “The Good Dinosaur. ” Among other new   offerings, Robert Zemeckis’s period spy drama, “Allied” (Paramount) did the best, collecting about $18 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Had the film not cost a hefty $85 million to make  —   not including marketing expenses  —   that sales total would have been fine. As it is, “Allied,” which drew soft reviews, will likely go down as another misfire for Mr. Zemeckis and Paramount. The studio is counting on foreign audiences to pick up the slack in partial overseas release, “Allied,” starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, took in $9. 4 million. “Bad Santa 2” (Broad Green) fared poorly. Costing an estimated $26 million to make, it sold about $9 million in tickets. The original “Bad Santa,” now considered a crude comedy classic, arrived to $22 million in Thanksgiving ticket sales in 2003, after adjusting for inflation. Bombing outright was Warren Beatty’s “Rules Don’t Apply,” a romantic comedic drama set in the late 1950s. Independently financed for $27 million and distributed by 20th Century Fox, “Rules Don’t Apply” collected a breathtakingly bad $2. 2 million for the   period. The movie likely suffered from mixed reviews, Mr. Beatty’s   absence from movie screens and   marketing materials that failed to make the film seem relevant to contemporary  . Even so, it was a strong weekend over all for Hollywood, as a broad array of movies, including the   arrival of the Weinstein Company’s “Lion,” and sizzling holdovers, including “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” generated wide audience interest. For the year to date, total ticket sales in North America stand at $10. 1 billion, a 4. 5 percent increase from the same period a year ago.",0
20934,Soros Groups Behind Massive Anti-Trump Tax Day Protest Plot,"The news media has been reporting on plans by a coalition of activist groups to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. [Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by George Soros or have close links to Soros financing.  The website for the march, which is slated for the deadline for Americans to file their tax returns, claims that its mission is to get Trump to release his tax returns and more. The site relates: President Trump needs to be straight with the American people. To whom does he owe favors? Who are his policies really intended to benefit? Who will he put first? Working families are struggling to make ends meet, but we pay our fair share in taxes  —   does Donald Trump pay any at all? Organizers of the march claim to be “ordinary Americans, community organizers, advocates, and people from all walks of life and all backgrounds joining together to raise our voices and send a bold message to this administration. ” Leaders from January’s Women’s March coalition are reportedly helping to organize the Tax March, which USA Today described as a “sequel” to the massive women’s march. Buzzfeed took note of the comparison to the women’s march in a piece titled, “Progressives Want Tax Day To Be The Next Women’s March Protest. ” Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ close associations with Soros. In a section titled “Who is organizing it?” the website for the Tax March lists the following eight groups, six of which are either funded by Soros or tied to Soros financing. The Tax March is grateful to have the support of the following organizations: American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Tax Fairness, Center for Popular Democracy, Indivisible Project, MoveOn. Org, Our Revolution, and The Working Families Party. Americans for Tax Fairness is the recipient of a grant from Soros’s Open Society Foundations’ U. S. Programs. MoveOn. Org is financed by Soros. The American Federation of Teachers’ Educational Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the American Federation of Teachers, was financed by the Strategic Opportunities Fund of Soros’s Open Society Foundations, leaked Open Society documents show. The Center for Popular Democracy is led by   activists. In 2013, Marbre Stahly, a policy advocate at the Center, became a Soros Justice Fellow, which comes with a stipend of $58, 700 to $110, 250 to fund   activism projects that last between   months. The Center was listed as Stahly’s “host” for the grant. According to her bio, the Center’s research analyst, Maggie Corser, “spent four years at the Open Society Foundations where she conducted research on the future of work, conservative political infrastructure, and a range of economic justice issue. ” Shawn Sebastian, the Center’s field director for its Fed Up Campaign, was a fellow at the so called   Unit of the Open Society Foundations’ Justice Initiative. Another Tax March organizer is the   Indivisible Project. Earlier this week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico last week profiled Indivisible in an article titled, “Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. ”  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible’s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented.

[“ ” is currently on display in Wittenberg, Germany, a town which has close ties to Protestant figure Martin Luther, and was created by the Evangelical Church in Hesse and Nassau, according to the Mirror.   “It consists of a metal box with a touch screen, two arms on the side, a head with eyes and a digital mouth at the top,” the Mirror explained. “After the robot wishes users a ‘warm welcome,’ it asks them if they want to be blessed by a male or female voice. It then asks the believer ‘what blessing do you want,’ which results in the robot making a mechanical sound as it raises its arms to the heavens and starts to smile. ” “Lights then start to flash in the robot’s arms as it says ‘God bless and protect you’ and recites a biblical verse,” the Mirror continued. “After the blessing, the user has the possibility to print the dictum,” similar to a fortune teller machine. The robot can communicate with users in five different languages, and the blessing can be printed out for them to take with them as well. Church spokesman Sebastian von Gehren claims that the new machine has attracted those who have very little in common with the church, but now routinely visit “every morning and evening” to receive an automated blessing. “It is an experiment that is supposed to inspire discussion,” he declared. “One half thinks it’s great  …     the other cannot imagine a blessing from a machine. ” Despite his praise of the robot, von Gehren added, “The machine should not replace the blessing of a pastor. ” “In the future, there will not be a blessing robot in every church,” he concluded.

20944,Henningsen: ‘US Anti-Trump Protests Similar to Soros Color Revolutions Abroad’,"21st Century Wire says… 
Organized efforts are underway by Democratic Party affiliated NGO’s to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this week’s US Presidential Election. 
On the eve of the US Election before voters went to the polls, 21WIRE political affairs analyst Patrick Henningsen accurately predicted this week’s unrest when he said : 
“If Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN’s 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage.” 
On Friday, Henningsen talked to RT International about the post-elections protests that were coordinated in part by Democratic Party ‘community organizing’ online platform MoveOn.org . Watch: 
. Not surprisingly, MoveOn.org have also launched a national ‘activist’ campaign to “ Abolish the Electoral College ” after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came up short with 232 (including New Hampshire) to Donald Trump’s 306 (including Arizona and Michigan). Final totals are not yet in, but thus far 2016 would be the fifth time in U.S. history that a presidential candidate has won the White House while losing the total popular vote.

21WIRE Associate Editor Shawn Helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in CIA and Soros-funded ‘color revolutions’ overseas – are now being deployed on US domestic shores by similar NGO front organizations: has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump. 
“Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week’s protests,” says Helton. 
Helton also raised the question as to why President Obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests, opting instead to “lead from behind.” He explains: 
“Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton’s total silence over their own party’s role in fomenting this week’s unrest – one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable – to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency.”

20947,Nuclear Reactor in Norway Leaks Radioactive Iodine,"Prison Planet.com October 26, 2016 
One of Norway’s nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine Monday morning, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). [1] 
In a statement released today, the NRPA said: 
“The radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low.” 
Experts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology, in the southern town of Halden, were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. 
Said Per Strand, deputy director-general at the NRPA, a government regulator: 
“Of course it’s an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want.” [2] 
The radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. 
Staff were evacuated from the institute, but later returned, donning protective gear, to assess the cause and extent of the leak, and halt it. 
A senior NRPA official said the incident would “maybe” be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7. By comparison, the incidents at Fukishima and Chernobyl were ranked 7. [3] Source: The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
Regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today . Atle Valseth, a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology, agreed. He said: 
“I don’t sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it wasn’t reported — it wasn’t good enough that we didn’t report it yesterday.” [2] 
Strand, the head of safety, preparedness and environment at the NRPA, expressed the regulator’s frustration. 
“We need to gather more information … But we are not happy with the situation, that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further.” [3] 
The Swiss Radiation Safety Authority (SRSA) said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility, which sits close to the Swiss border. 
Mark Foreman, a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel, which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramic-wrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. 
The iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall.

20950,Snapchat Shares Plummet After Grown-Ups Figure Out How to Use It,"November 10, 2016 
Snapchat, the final evolutionary stage before society gives up on sentences altogether and we start communicating in a series of emotive grunts, has seen a steep fall in share prices after proper adults figure out how to use the application successfully. Observers have described the phenomenon, ‘Abnormal’, ‘Chilling’ and ‘Like watching a dog doing the hoovering – not something that should be in a sane world.’ 
The photographic bants-platform first believed adult use of Snapchat was an anomaly caused by over-protective parents rooting through their teenager’s belongings in search for evidence of pre-marital sex and ‘The Reefer’. However, pattern analysis of messages suggests the missives were sent intentionally as part of a deliberate campaign to be seen as, ‘Not hurtling inexorably towards the grave’. Company bosses are reported to be, ‘Gutted’. 
‘It’s a death knell’ said CEO Michaela Hodgkinson. ‘This will just about wipe out our user base. And we tried so hard. We made it so counter-intuitive to people who didn’t grow up with access to enough pixilated tits and ass to wrap multiple times round the Milky Way like an erotic flesh sausage. God, I wish it were the good old days, when adults treated innovation with the sort of suspicion usually reserved for men called ‘Mohammed’ walking into a small town Texan airport.’ 
‘It is a well-known fact that adolescents instinctively recoil from in shame, disgust and loathing to anything enjoyed by the over 30’s,’ explained youth-guru Samuel Cook. ‘Look at Michael Bolton. Once upon a time, the mere Herbal-Essence-esque swoosh of his flowing easy-listening locks could obliterate juvenile knickers like the oncoming of a Biblical flood; now, I’ve seen a teenager to projectile vomit the words, ‘Cock-nugget’ just by hearing the opening bars to ‘When A Man Loves A Woman’. 
Experts suggest that teenagers’ influence over what is cool acts as compensation for a future without the possibility of jobs, savings, or affordable housing, at least until their parents pop their clogs and they can wrench a decent standard of living out of their elder’s hoary baby-boomer claws. Teenagers are expected to flee the social media site like rats aboard a sinking over-60s cruise ship and seek pastures even more disorientating and obtuse. Prospective new digital street-corners-outside-the-offie include, ‘Bluster’, ‘Waffle’ and a messaging service where users communicate entirely using quotes from the 1988 film Beetlejuice. S-Bahn",0
20951,Police Drag Anti-Mass Migration Campaigner off Streets for Asking Anti-Islamophobia Protestors Questions,"  immigration campaigner Tommy Robinson was verbally and physically abused by demonstrators on a   march on Saturday, after approaching them and attempting to engage in conversation. Police detained him and ordered him off the streets, saying this was “easier” than “taking on” the aggressive protestors.[  activist Tommy Robinson was joined by Rebel Media reporter Caolan Robertson, approaching demonstrators to ask their views on issues such as female genital mutilation and sexual grooming.  Within five minutes of arriving at the protest, according to Robertson, the pair were surrounded by people shouting “Nazi, white supremacist!” resulting in attending police officers detaining Robinson. Footage shows Robinson approaching a man screaming “Nazi scum!” and asking for him to explain why he is a Nazi. A policewoman quickly removes Robinson from the scene, asking him to “respect that these people don’t want to talk to you”. A subsequent attempt by Robinson to engage a student protestor about her views on Islam is terminated by an aggressive older male, who pushes him away shouting: “We don’t want a Nazi on this demo. Get off!” Robinson tries to mollify the man by explaining that he is just trying to have a “polite conversation” but the male begins screaming about losing family in the Holocaust and whips up unruly chants of “Nazi scum, off our streets!” It is at this point that Robinson is dragged away by the police, who attempt to separate him from Robertson and his camera. When Robinson asks why he is the one being manhandled when it is the demonstrators who are being aggressive, a female officer explains bluntly that “it’s easier to remove you” than to “take on” the angry crowd. She also claims Robinson is the one causing the violence “by his sheer presence”. Footage shot at another point on the march shows Robinson attempting to ask demonstrators their view on the oppression of women under Shariah, and being told “You’re a racist” repeatedly. “Is that all you’ve got?” Robinson finally asks. “Yes it is!” the demonstrator replies. Elsewhere, a protestor tells Robinson she is on the march because it feels as though years of   leislation has been for nothing. “What if I told you that, statistically, white people are the biggest victims of racism in the UK?” Robinson asks. “White people can’t be victims of racism,” she scoffs. In fact, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) found that most victims of racism in England and Wales were white as long ago as 1999, in a report titled “Racial Attacks and Harassment”. Scottish statistics published in 2015 show that “White Britons” are also the most common victims of race hate crimes north of the border. Scotland’s first ever   murder victim was a white schoolboy named Kriss Donald, who was kidnapped, stabbed 13 times, and burned alive by a Pakistani gang in an unprovoked attack in 2004. Finally, a figure Robinson identified as Unite Against Fascism leader Raymond Bennett begins abusing Robinson and has the police remove him a second time. “They don’t want to debate their issues because they’re so blinkered, so fascist,” Robinson tells Robertson. “These people’s views have never been challenged   …     they’ve been indoctrinated. ”  ",0
20953,Obamacare Architect Says It’s Working As Designed!,"Print 
Many look at the new healthcare system with their higher premiums and wonder what has happened. Why are their coverages shrinking and their premiums growing? Some have come to the conclusion that the system itself is to blame. They believe that Obamacare is broken? 
What they fail to recognize is that this is not the case at all. What we see as failing to make insurance better has made it worse, but it is simply a problem of ignorance. We just are not smart enough to know the truth. Higher premiums and less coverage is the point, it seems. 
Breitbart reports : 
On Wednesday’s broadcast of “CNN Newsroom,” MIT Economics Professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber argued that “The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty.” 
Gruber said, “Obamacare’s not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two-fold. One was to cover the uninsured, of which we’ve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare.” 
So basically, everything that is being reported is not accurate. There is no reason to think that all of the insurers are bailing like rats on a sinking ship. It just appears that way. This is little more that fool’s hope so that there will not be a mass exit from the exchange. 
But, unfortunately, people no longer demand proof. They simply take a man like this at his word. So, he will get away with telling Chicken Little that the sky is not falling; even while it is coming down on his head. 
When you chase emptiness, God will let you catch it.

20955,"The Products that Make Men Grow Breasts, Linked to Cancers of the Prostate and Liver","Owned by Unilever, the Axe brand includes a range of men’s grooming products with many of the ingredients never even tested for safety according to the C.I.R. – Cosmetic Ingredient Review. Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals 
Axe products are loaded with endocrine disrupting chemicals. Endocrine disruptorsare exogenous, synthetic chemicals that have hormone-like effects on both humans and wild-life and interfere with the endocrine system by either mimicking or blocking our natural hormones and disrupting their respective body functions. Member scientists of the Endocrine Society issued a report in which they claim: 
“We present the evidence that endocrine disruptors have effects on male and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostrate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology.” 
New studies are also revealing that these harmful chemicals may be causing physical feminization in males. A study published by the International Journal of Andrology found that feminization of boys can now be seen through their play habits. 
Medical experts are now wondering whether exposure to years of these toxic chemicals is part of the reason so many older men are low on testosterone and experiencing erectile dysfunction. So they take a little blue pill and get exposed to even more chemicals and the cycle continues. Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 
Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly is the active ingredient in Axe deodorant products. One or more animal studies show kidney or renal system effects at very low doses, mammalian cells show positive mutation results, animal studies show reproductive effects at moderate doses. 
Aluminum was first recognized as a human neurotoxin in 1886, before being used as an antiperspirant. A neurotoxin is a substance that causes damage to nerves or nerve tissue. 
COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE 
COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE is a very toxic ingredient which has been linked to cancer in animal tests. The biggest danger of using a product with cocamidopropyl betaine is its potential contamination with nitrosamines . 
Nitrosamines are created when nitrosating agents are combined with amines. Nitrosamines have been identified as one of the most potent classes of carcinogens, having caused cancer in more than 40 different animal species as well as in humans. PPG-14 Butyl Ether 
PPG stands for popypropylene glycol, which is made from a completely artificial petroleum product, methyl oxirane. Another name for that is propylene oxide (which is a probable human carcinogen). Propylene oxide is also an irritant and highly flammable. Butyl ethers are in the paraben family, and they are toluene derivatives (toxic petrochemical compounds). Toluene has proven to have a harmful affect on the reproductive system while parabens have been linked to cancer. 
PEG-8 Distearate 
According to a report in the International Journal of Toxicology by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) committee, impurities found in various PEG compounds include ethylene oxide; 1,4-dioxane; polycyclic aromatic compounds; and heavy metals such as lead, iron, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, and arsenic. Many of these impurities are linked to cancer. BHT 
There have been many studies which demonstrate that BHT accumulates over time in the body, having a toxic impact on the lungs, liver and kidneys amongst other negative effects. A study by Gann in 1984 showed that BHT was capable of promoting chemically-induced forestomach and bladder cancer in male rats. 
A 1988 Swedish study by Thompson looked at both BHT and BHA. They found that both were toxic and tumour promoting. Both antioxidants were observed to be cytotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 100 to 750 microM. At equimolar concentrations BHT was more cytotoxic than BHA.",0
20956,Police Report: Migrant Crime Drastically Increased in 2016,"The German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has released a new report which claims that crimes committed by migrants rapidly increased in 2016 compared to the previous year. [The new report from the BKA states that in 2016 there was a total of 295, 000 crimes that involved immigrants as suspects, up 90, 000 from 2015 when there were 205, 000. The police say that the crimes counted did not include migrant specific crimes like illegal entry into Germany or staying in the country illegally Die Welt reports.  The three most cited crimes that involved immigrants were counterfeiting which accounted for 29 percent of all the crimes, theft at 26 percent, and violence including bodily harm at 24 percent. The BKA said there were 450 cases in which migrants had attempted to kill another person, with 66 murder suspects and a total of 82 victims. The twelve victims of the Berlin Christmas market terror attack in December committed by Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri were also counted in the statistics. In   of the cases of attempted murder or homicide, the victims were immigrants themselves with 59 victims coming from migrant backgrounds while other victims included five EU citizens, two   citizens and 16 German nationals. Breitbart London has reported on several cases, primarily in and around asylum homes, in which migrant men have beaten and sometimes even murdered family members such as their own wives. The BKA defines “immigrants” in the report as anyone who is either an asylum seeker, a person with refugee status, an illegal immigrant or failed asylum seekers who are allowed to stay in the country. A spokeswoman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said that the government was working on a full report that will also include criminal statistics from the regional governments as well. Several regions in Germany have already released migrant crime statistics and all have shown a drastic rise in migrant crime. In Munich police have noted that almost half of the criminal suspects in the Bavarian city are “ . ” In the German capital of Berlin, the senate has launched a formal inquiry into why migrant crime rates are so high in the city. The Berlin crime statistics showed that 13 percent of the migrant population in the city were suspects in various crimes, compared to the German population in which only 6 percent were suspects in crimes.   and Bavaria have both expressed concerns with the growing migrant crime trend. Last month   State Criminal Police Office (LKA) president Ralf Michelfelder said, “we are very worried about the rise in violence by asylum seekers. ”  Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart. com,      ",0
20957,Universe is a hologram/virtual reality - But why? Could it be this?,"link Okay, we are all familiar with the theory that our universe is some sort of simulation, math that works so specifically, so well, so many predictions from math and science that are proved right more and more often etc and so on. (not going to get into ""proof"" google it!) So you have to ask yourself WHY would a thing, being, God, whatever want to create such a virtual simulation? We know that we as humans have the right to live and have family's, often with as many kids as sustainable (at the time). This means that however well we create food, we WILL use up all resources on this planet weather we make the best plans or not. But we cant crack viable ways to leave this planet and populate others beyond our own slowly decaying star. So what about this. What if the answer was to create a sped up reality, using all our computing and programming powers to emulate the universe (or observable universe), wait for life to grow on a planet and then give them the same problem we have so that we can reap the answer for ourselves? LEAVING THE SOLAR SYSTEM TO COLONISE OTHER SYSTEMS, INDEFINITELY. Could it be as simple as that? Love to hear your thoughts, been thinking about this for some time now.",0

Oktober 2016 Autofahrer entlarvt geheimen Zahlentrick, mit dem sich jeder Blitzer überlisten lässt Berlin (Archiv) - Ein Berliner Autofahrer hat einen geheimen Trick entdeckt, mit dem sich Radarfallen und Blitzer auf Autobahnen zu 100 Prozent überlisten lassen. Erste Praxistests scheinen die Theorie des Hobbyphysikers zu bestätigen. Seine zahlenbasierte Methode soll für jeden Autofahrer innerhalb von Minuten erlernbar sein. Seit 1990 ist Jörg Haffke jeden Tag auf deutschen Autobahnen unterwegs, was den Berufspendler oft teuer zu stehen kommt: ""Früher verging kaum eine Woche, ohne dass ich ein Knöllchen im Briefkasten hatte, nur weil ich mal wieder in eine Radarfalle geraten war"", klagt der 43-Jährige. Die verschiedensten Gegenmittel habe er schon ausprobiert: ""Reflektierende CDs am Innenspiegel, abgedecktes Kennzeichen oder Blitzwarner-Apps – nichts hatte auf Dauer wirklich Erfolg"", berichtet der Familienvater. Er hat den Code geknackt: Jörg Haffke Haffke ist jedoch nicht nur ein cleverer Bastler, sondern auch ein guter Beobachter: ""Irgendwann fiel mir auf, dass neben den Autobahnen immer wieder so merkwürdige Schilder mit Zahlen drauf versteckt sind."" Zwei Jahre und 122 Excel-Tabellen später ist sich Haffke nun sicher, den geheimen Algorithmus hinter den kryptischen Blechtafeln endlich entlarvt zu haben: ""Wenn man ein Tempo mit einem Tachowert fährt, der in etwa der Zahl auf dem letzten gesichteten Schild entspricht oder darunter liegt, verhindert man ein Auslösen des nächsten Blitzers! Man ist praktisch unsichtbar."" Welche physikalische Kraft diese offensichtliche Fernwirkung herbeiführt, sei ihm zwar nicht ganz klar: ""Vielleicht gibt es ja doch etwas, das größer ist als wir!"" Das Ergebnis gebe ihm aber recht: ""Keine Knöllchen in den letzten sechs Monaten"", erklärt er stolz. Nun will Haffke seine Erfahrungen an andere Autofahrer weitergeben – und hat dazu die Standorte der knapp fünf Millionen bisher identifizierten ""Zahlenschilder"" in einem einzigartigen Nachschlagewerk verzeichnet.

20961,The Chronicles of Carlos Danger,"As the FBI assesses emails from former congressman’s devices, his sex scandal is once again making headlines. Joe Biden’s response: ‘Oh, God’ By Oliver Milman The Guardian October 31, 2016 
As a fractious and often sordid presidential campaign reaches its denouement, Hillary Clinton may be reflecting upon the grim irony that it is Anthony Weiner who has provided what could be the final, miserable twist. 
Weiner’s predilection for sending sexually laden text messages derailed his career in Congress and his chances of becoming mayor of New York City , but his soap-opera-style re-emergence in the 11th hour of the presidential race may yet trigger the greatest political carnage of all. 
His appearance comes in an election already defined by allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by Clinton’s husband, former president Bill Clinton, and by the Republican nominee, Donald Trump . 
On Friday, Clinton called on the FBI to “immediately” explain its announcement that it was reviewing a new batch of emails relating to her, after a review of her use of a private email server was closed in July. 
Then, the FBI director, James Comey, said Clinton had been “ extremely careless ” in her use of a private server while secretary of state, but said there were no grounds for a criminal investigation. 
On Friday, he said in a letter to members of Congress that the bureau would analyze newly discovered emails that “appear to be pertinent to the investigation”. Republicans were quick to characterise the move as a “reopening” of the investigation into Clinton’s server, a description Democrats rejected. 
It was later reported that the new emails came from an iPad, cellphone and laptop seized by the FBI and previously shared by Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide. 
Clinton’s campaign and the Obama administration have been left bewildered by the latest FBI intervention, less than two weeks before the election, with Weiner’s involvement rubbing salt into the wound. 
John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, said: “Director Comey’s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant. 
“It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.” 
Vice-president Joe Biden was more direct, telling CNN’s Michael Smerconish in an interview broadcast on Saturday: “Well, oh God, Anthony Weiner. I should not comment on Anthony Weiner . I’m not a big fan. I wasn’t before he got in trouble.” 
Weiner is being investigated by the FBI and police in North Carolina over text messages sent to a 15-year-old girl . In the wake of the latest allegations against him, Abedin, who has herself been a target for criticism from Republicans for some time, separated from Weiner . She has continued in her role as Clinton’s closest ally on the campaign trail. 
Once seen as a rising Democratic star, Weiner was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 after he sent a picture of his penis, clad in his boxer shorts, to a 21-year-old student via Twitter. After he initially denied involvement in the messages, further pictures sent by Weiner emerged and he stepped down, at the urging of Barack Obama .",0
20962,Total Desperation Sets In as President Obama Plays the Woman Card,"at 4:08 pm 1 Comment 
With the neither the racist nor the Putin-puppet label sticking to Trump, team Clinton and its lobotomized surrogates have regressed back to square one: playing the woman card . 
As I noted in a post earlier this week, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley just published an article at Time claiming (with zero evidence of course), that the Hillary Clinton email server scandal only exists because she is a woman. Here’s a brief snippet of what she said: 
‘It’s not about emails; it’s about public communication by a woman’ 
I am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It’s us. 
The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she’s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. 
It’s not about emails; it’s about public communication by a woman in general. Of course, in the year 2016, no one (probably not even The Donald) could make this argument explicitly. After all, he and his fellow Republicans are not waging a war on women. How do we know that? They have said so. And they’re men, so they must be telling the truth. 
I know. It’s really hard to believe the above is real, but it is. 
Moving along, President Obama himself is now getting in the mud. 
Here’s what he had to say today in Ohio, according to NBC : 
COLUMBUS, Ohio — President Barack Obama said Tuesday that sexism is to blame for the tight race for the White House, telling an Ohio crowd that “Hillary Clinton is consistently treated differently than just about any other candidate I see out there.” 
Obama went on: “There’s a reason we haven’t had a woman president.” 
Speaking specifically to “the guys out there,” Obama told them to “look inside yourself and ask yourself, if you’re having problems with this stuff how much of it is that we’re just not used to it?” 
Yep, because the American public handily elected a black man twice, but somehow we all draw the line at a woman. Perhaps, just perhaps, the problem is with Hillary. 
Moving along, all this reminded me of a very prescient comment made by Glenn Greenwald a couple of years ago, which I highlighted in the post, Glenn Greenwald on the 2016 Elections – “They’ll Probably Have a Gay Person After Hillary” : 
Hillary is banal, corrupted, drained of vibrancy and passion. I mean, she’s been around forever, the Clinton circle. She’s a fucking hawk and like a neocon, practically. She’s surrounded by all these sleazy money types who are just corrupting everything everywhere. But she’s going to be the first female president, and women in America are going to be completely invested in her candidacy. Opposition to her is going to be depicted as misogynistic, like opposition to Obama has been depicted as racist. It’s going to be this completely symbolic messaging that’s going to overshadow the fact that she’ll do nothing but continue everything in pursuit of her own power. They’ll probably have a gay person after Hillary who’s just going to do the same thing. 
Obama could’ve gone out on a high note, but he decided to go low.

20966,Son of Former Democratic VP Nominee Geraldine Ferraro Is Pardoned for 1988 Cocaine Conviction - Breitbart,"The governor of Vermont has pardoned the son of former Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro almost 30 years after he was convicted of selling cocaine to an undercover officer while in college, the Daily Mail reported. [John Zaccaro Jr. was a Middlebury College student when he was arrested in 1986 for selling $25 worth of cocaine to an undercover state police officer.  He was convicted in 1988 and sentenced to four months in jail. Zaccaro was placed in a house arrest program where inmates paid for their living arrangements and served 90 days of his sentence “in a luxury $1, 500 a month Burlington apartment,” UPI reported in 1988. Zaccaro’s defense attorney argued that it was a case of entrapment because the officer claimed she was a student and lured him, People reported in 1988. Ferraro accused prosecutors of unfairly targeting her son because of her   position as the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee. Outgoing Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin pardoned Zaccaro and nine others Saturday. “I believe in second chances, and I believe we as a society will continue to move towards a more sensible approach to drug addiction and criminal justice,” Shumlin said in a statement. “As governor, I am honored to be able help people move past their mistakes and help relieve what can essentially amount to a   of burden and stigma. ” Zaccaro currently is Principal of P.

20969,Former Obama Spox: U.S. ’Absolutely’ Hurt Diplomatically by Obama Failing to Act on Syrian ’Red Line’ Promise - Breitbart,"Former Obama State Department appointee Marie Harf said on Tuesday that the former president’s decision not to order a military strike against Syria after dictator Bashar   crossed his stated “red line” by using chemical weapons against his own people hurt the United States’ diplomatic efforts going forward. [“Now did not enforcing the red line hurt us diplomatically?” Harf said at a discussion at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D. C. “Absolutely. ”  Harf, who was a spokesperson for Secretary of State John Kerry, said that decision also hurt Barack Obama politically. “Did it give some people the notion that they used politically that we were unwilling to use military action   …     absolutely,” Harf said, noting that Obama’s decision also was affected by the lack of support for such strikes by his fellow Democrats. Michael Pregent, adjunct fellow at Hudson, said that the strike on Assad’s military assets ordered by President Donald Trump after the April 4 chemical attack that killed scores of innocent people, including children, was Trump’s most significant foreign policy win since taking office. Assad denied  —   as he has repeatedly done over the course of the more than   civil war  —   that he was responsible for the attack. But the U. S. has claimed it is certain Assad did carry out the attack. “Last week, Bashar  ’s regime killed even more of its own people using chemical weapons,” Tillerson said in the days following the attack. “Our missile strike in response to his repeated use of banned weapons was necessary as a matter of U. S. national security interest. ” “We do not want the regime’s uncontrolled stockpile of chemical weapons to fall into the hands of ISIS or other terrorist groups who could, and want to, attack the United States or our allies,” Tillerson said. The latest development in Syria is a plan brokered by Russia, Turkey, and Iran that would establish four “safe zones” in Syria designed to protect innocent Syrians. But participants in the Hudson discussion said it is unclear whether those safe zones would not ultimately help the Assad regime.",0

The telephone conversation dealt with the issues of trade deficit, international friendship, and both nations working together to stem the flow of drugs and weapons, the Mexican government revealed in their statement. Both presidents told their staff to continue discussing bilateral issues.  The two had a productive and constructive call regarding the bilateral relationship between the two countries, the current trade deficit the United States has with Mexico, the importance of the friendship between the two nations, and the need for the two nations to work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales. With respect to payment for the border wall, both presidents recognize their clear and very public differences of positions on this issue but have agreed to work these differences out as part of a comprehensive discussion on all aspects of the bilateral relationship.

20972,Trump Reverses Obama’s Last Days Drilling Ban - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C. —  President Donald Trump on Friday signed a new executive order on an   Offshore Energy Strategy as he proclaimed, “It’s going to lead to a lot of great wealth for our country and a lot of great jobs for our country. ”[From the Roosevelt Room of the White House, President Trump thanked Secretaries Wilbur Ross and Ryan Zinke, lauded their job performance, then told those gathered:  This is a great day for American workers and families, and today we’re unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of   American energy jobs. Our country is blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves. But the federal government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production.  And when they say closed, they mean closed. This deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth. I pledged to take action, and today I am keeping that promise. The President stated that the order initiates “opening offshore areas to   energy exploration,” which reverses an Obama Administration Arctic leasing ban. “It reverses the previous administration’s Arctic leasing ban, and directs Secretary Zinke to allow responsible development of offshore areas that will bring revenue to our Treasury and jobs to our workers. ”   Barack Obama seized this last days’ opportunity to shore up his environmental policy in December 2016. The Washington Post reported that he banned offshore oil and gas drilling in hundreds of millions of acres of federal land in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. The ban was coordinated with a related move by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The report cited a White House aide, who claimed regarding the Section   of the 1953 act withdrawals, “There is no authority for subsequent presidents to     …     I can’t speak to what a future Congress will do. ” After the   Arctic leasing ban was announced, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) responded in a tweet the Post cited, “Yet another Obama abuse of power. Hopefully, on[e] that will be reversed  …    exactly one month from today. ” Trump added that the order, “will enable better scientific study of our offshore resources and research that has blocked everything from happening for far too long. ” The result, according to Trump, will be energy cost reduction and job creation, while making the country more secure and energy independent. “It’s going to lead to a lot of great wealth for our country and a lot of great jobs for our country,” said Trump. Ahead of the President’s speech, Vice President Mike Pence called the order “an important step toward American energy independence. ” The entire executive order can be found at WhiteHouse. gov.

20977,Swedish Police Chief Shut Down By Interior Minister After Call to Deport Terror Suspects,"Citing “freedom of speech” and the possibility that expelled migrants risk “persecution” if sent back to their homelands, Sweden’s Justice Minister rejected Erik Nord’s call to deport Islamic   migrants and demanded the police chief “explain himself”. [“Not because it would have prevented Friday’s attack but surely we should be able to withdraw Swedish residency rights from people who support violent extremism,” wrote the Greater Gothenburg police chief on Sunday, two days after an alleged terror attack in Stockholm in which four people died and many were injured.  But government minister Morgan Johansson slapped down Nord’s “problematic” suggestion, for which he said the police chief needs to “explain himself”. “We have freedom of speech in Sweden. This means people have the right to hold repulsive opinions here,” said Johansson. “But there are always limits  …     For example when it comes to hate speech,” he added. Asserting that migrants with residence permits are in Sweden because they are in need of protection, the Social Democratic party politician warned that “there is a risk [migrants who support violent extremism] could face persecution if they were sent back”. Nord told the Gothenburg Post on Sunday: “We should be able to tell   who are going around proposing the nation become a totalitarian state, be it political or religious, that they have to go back home where they belong. ” Noting how currently Sweden can only deport individuals found guilty of committing or funding acts of terror, the police chief argued that it should also be possible for the nation to expel people who say they support groups which back violent extremism. “Sure there are going to be people who say ISIS is great and that religious extremism is fantastic. But then I don’t think these people should be allowed to stay in Sweden where they are bankrolled and have their lifestyles paid for by the government. ” “Islam itself is not extreme, but there are forms of Islamism and jihad which are causing problems,” he continued. “At this point in time, we know that there are many people going around and giving lectures in support of this sort of extremism. “I just don’t think it’s fair,” Nord added, telling the newspaper that police receive intelligence about Islamist preachers “all the time”. “It’s disgusting that we allow bad people to canvass here, waving ISIS flags,” said Nord. “It’s an insult to those who have fled from Islamic State. ” “I realise that the things I’m saying here could be read as political statements. But we’re living in a new reality now in which, sometimes, it’s important that we be allowed to talk about things we observe,” he told Expressen.",0
20978,’Liberal Answer to Breitbart News’ Loses CEO Before It Even Launches - Breitbart,"The much ballyhooed “Breitbart of the left” planned by Clinton apologist David Brock lost its CEO before the site even launched, as investigative reporter David Sirota announced he is bowing out of the project. [After the disastrous 2016 election revealed that his Hilary Clinton cheerleading efforts were woefully ineffective, David Brock went back to liberal donors with his hand out  —   asking for even more cash to start a new website that he promised would become the left’s “answer to Breitbart News. ”  Not long after his initial announcement, Brock proudly reported that he had hired investigative reporter David Sirota as the CEO of the new effort named True Blue Media. Sirota was said to be preparing to quit his role as senior investigations editor at the International Business Times to lead Brock’s new Breitbart of the left. But now it appears those plans have fallen apart. This week Sirota sent out an email to supporters and friends to “pass on some personal news” explaining that “circumstances of the job changed” and he is now taking a pass on the role as chief of the left’s answer to Breitbart. “As you know, I was thrilled to initially accept the proposal to work with True Blue Media because I believe in nonpartisan accountability journalism,” Sirota said in his statement. “However, the circumstances of the job subsequently changed. True Blue Media does not right now have in hand the resources for the kind of independent, nonpartisan journalism I want to continue to do and that is needed to execute on the ambitious editorial strategy that we agreed on. Therefore, I have decided to turn down the job. I wish David Brock all the best. ” Sirota did not elaborate on exactly what had changed between the time he initially agreed to head up Brock’s news website and today’s decision to bail out of the project. But the statement hints to the possibility that Brock is not getting the funding he would need for the sort of fully staffed news organization Sirota had envisioned. Perhaps Sirota doesn’t want to be part of a mere propaganda effort and expected the resources to be able to sustain a serious news bureau. The news comes on the heels of reports that many top liberal donors are getting tired of David Brock’s many failed efforts to “help” the liberal cause. Early in January, for instance Clinton donor John Morgan complained, “Anybody who gives money to him is pissing down a rathole. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0

He added that “it’s very early. ” When asked if Yellen was “toast,” the president said, “No. Not toast. ” This has caught many on Wall Street and Capitol Hill by surprise, overturning the near universal expectation that Trump would pick a new head for the central bank. The possibility that Trump may support the status quo at the Fed has some supporters scratching their heads. On Wall Street, this is widely viewed as the result of the influence of Gary Cohn and other financiers on the president. “I think we’re seeing the influence of guys like Gary Cohn, Steven Mnuchin and Steve Schwarzman. They probably explained that markets want him to show he’s   about the Fed and favors a dovish stance,” said one investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Dovish” is Wall Street lingo for leaning toward keeping interest rates lower. “I do like a   rate policy, I must be honest with you,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal in response to questions about Yellen. Cohn is Trump’s chief economic adviser and holds the position of director of the National Economic Council. A lifelong Democrat, Cohn was the number 2 man in charge of Goldman Sachs until he left to join the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is also a Goldman alum and has close ties to Wall Street. Schwarzman is a   friend of Trump’s and the   of the Blackstone Group, a   Wall Street private equity firm. He reportedly speaks to Trump by phone several times a week and was recently seated beside Trump at a White House gathering of corporate chiefs. Trump also said he no longer opposes the   bank, which he accused of “ ” and called unnecessary during the campaign. “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal. Around 40 percent of   money is used to subsidize exports from Boeing. Less than 20 percent goes directly to small businesses. The language Trump used, referring to small businesses as ‘vendors’ indicates the influence of big businesses that benefit from   subsidies. They have long argued that they pass along subsidies to smaller businesses that manufacture parts for their exports, a   theory of subsidies. “  doesn’t help the economy. It doesn’t drain the swamp,” writes     critic Tim Carney at the Washington Examiner. Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, applauded Trump’s change of heart on  .

20981,New York Toymaker to Sell 1st Transgender Doll Based on Transgender Teen - Breitbart,"A New York toy maker is set to debut what it says is the first transgender doll available on the market. [Tonner Doll Company says it will debut a doll based on    transgender teen Jazz Jennings from the TLC reality series I Am Jazz at the New York Toy Fair, CBS Los Angeles reported.  The company has made dolls based on a variety of characters from books and television shows, including Spiderman, Harry Potter, Doctor Who, and Wonder Woman. The toy will have a genderless plastic mold typical of most dolls, is being tested for children eight years and older, and is expected to sell for $89. 99, ABC News reported. “Jazz stands for everything I respect from a human nature point of view  —   she’s incredibly brave, intelligent,   and creative,” said company founder Robert Tonner, who called the doll “groundbreaking. ” Jennings appeared on a Barbara Walters   special at age 6. The teen, whose biological sex is male, has identified as a female from a very young age. Jennings is the youngest honoree in The Advocate Magazine’s “Top Forty Under 40” annual list and was named as one of Time magazine’s Most Influential Teens for 2014 and 2015.

20982,‘Jeopardy!’ Champion Dies Before She Could See Her Triumph on TV - The New York Times,"There can’t be many “Jeopardy!” champions easier to root for than Cindy Stowell. Ms. Stowell has won six times in a row on taped episodes of the quiz show that began broadcasting last week. Ms. Stowell has developed a fan base like few other contestants. But she is unable to enjoy her performance on TV, or the outpouring of love from “Jeopardy!” watchers. That’s because she died on Dec. 5, just over a week before her episodes began showing. She was 41. When the science content developer from Austin, Tex. began recording her episodes on Aug. 31, she had Stage 4 colon cancer, a fact known by only a few of the show’s staff members and the host, Alex Trebek. Her competitors were unaware. The show has not announced how long Ms. Stowell’s streak of victories will continue. A “Jeopardy!” champion continues playing until unseated by a contestant. On Tuesday, she won again, bringing her total prize money to $103, 803. Her boyfriend, Jason Hess, and her relatives Greg Stowell and Carole Stowell said in a statement, “Cindy came on ‘Jeopardy!’ to play the game she loved, and in doing so, she was able to make a contribution to cancer research in the hopes that no one else would have to go through what she did. ” The money will go to the Cancer Research Institute, according to KXAN, a TV station in Austin. “She knew she wasn’t going to be around, and so she felt like the best thing she could do was try to help do what she could to help get us to a cure faster,” Mr. Hess told the station. After passing an online contestant test early this year, Ms. Stowell was invited to an audition in Oklahoma City. At that point, she reached out to a producer. “Do you have any idea how long it typically takes between an   interview and the taping date? I ask because I just found out that I don’t have too much longer to live,” she wrote, according to the show’s website. “The doctor’s best guess is about six months,” she continued. “If there is the chance that I’d be able to still tape episodes of ‘Jeopardy!’ if I were selected, I’d like to do that and donate any winnings to   …     charities involved in cancer research. If it is unlikely that the turnaround time would be that quick, then I’d like to give up my tryout spot to someone else. ” A producer told her to go to Oklahoma City for the interview, and if she qualified she would be booked three weeks later, the fastest turnaround possible. She competed on painkillers while fighting a blood infection, according to Mr. Hess. “Competing on ‘Jeopardy!’ was a lifelong dream for Cindy, and we’re glad she was able to do so,” Mr. Trebek said in a statement. In her first performance, she won $22, 801, defeating an editor from Vermilion, Ohio, who had won $107, 499 over seven days. She won $8, 199 in her second episode, and on Thursday she came from behind, adding $8, 600 to her   total. While it’s not unusual for the show to establish back stories for the contestants, the viewers’ knowledge of Ms. Stowell’s condition “is to share a sad secret with her,” Seth Rosenthal wrote at SB Nation. “I sit in awe of a brilliant woman earning every last dollar she can for the causes dearest to her building a sum of infinite potential in the face of her own finality,” he said. “I have never rooted harder for anyone to win anything. ”",0

[The mainstream press initially reported the arrest and bail of six men from Iraq, Syria, and Bahrain after local woman Chelsey Wright, 26, reported a “serious assault”.  However, it is alleged the men all escaped charges and local police failed to investigate the incident properly. Absolutely amazing support for Chelsey.

Ms. Wright says she managed to get out of the room when the first man unlocked the door to let another man in, but was kicked down the stairs when she attempted to flee. She says a number of men attempted to restrain her as she made for the front door, dragging her back into the house by her hair in the presence of a witness when she got outside. @AMDWaters and Chelsea at todays #JusticeforChelsea ralley in Sunderland! pic. twitter.   —   Lucy Brown (@LUCY____BROWN) May 13, 2017,  She was able to escape the house a second time and reach safety, and was examined at a sexual assault clinic the same day.

20991,Obama’s Last Battle: His Legacy - The New York Times,"In the waning days of his presidency, Barack Obama is waging a final battle  —   not over legislation or a Supreme Court seat, but over how he will be remembered. In the latest episode of The   we explore what, exactly, the Obama legacy will be. The president is aggressively telling his version, through a major speech broadcast on   TV, interviews and a forthcoming book. But   Donald J. Trump is telling a very different version, through tweets, speeches and news conferences. Who’s will win out? I speak with David Leonhardt, an   columnist at The New York Times who chronicled the Obama administration from the start, and Jodi Kantor, a reporter whose book, “The Obamas,” was just reissued with a new preface. Our   conversation explores Mr. Obama’s impact on race, health care, economic inequality and America’s place in the world. And we seek to answer a question historians may puzzle over for decades: Just how consequential was this presidency compared with past White Houses? I speak as well to former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts about whether Mr. Obama’s relationship with Republican lawmakers had to be so adversarial, polarizing and partisan. Who was to blame? Could Mr. Obama have done more to get things done using executive orders? Mr. Frank is blunt. “Absolutely not,” he says. “You had a Republican majority in both houses that (A) was determined to undercut him politically and (B) did not care if the government was dysfunctional because they don’t like government anyway. And to the extent, by the way, that a failure for the government to perform discredited government, that was a further benefit as far as they’re concerned. ” From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.

20994,Bad News For Hillary After Camera Caught Why She Gave Strange Men $300,"Bad News For Hillary After Camera Caught Why She Gave Strange Men $300 Posted on October 31, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Man from video (left), Hillary Clinton thinking she got away with it (right) 
Hillary Clinton can’t seem to escape the karma that’s coming her way as the days are dwindling down to the election, and with each one, something else comes out against her that she can’t escape. After the FBI dropped the ball on the first investigation, they’re redeeming themselves the second time around, and now it’s out what she paid strange men $300 to do. 
The hits just keep on coming at Hillary. If she gets off the hook again this investigation in addition to everything WikiLeaks has released about her, then we know that there is something seriously corrupt with our government. 
Worse yet would be if she’s elected as president, which will force Americans to pay an exceptionally detrimental price for the next four years that could bring lasting implications. The man in this video knows who may have helped in that destructive outcome, done for a small fee that Hillary’s campaign evidently handed out like candy for this cause at a halfway house in California. 
MicroSpookyLeaks came forward with the footage they obtained, when they posted it to social media on Saturday which shows the unnamed person in this video admitting what Democrats were giving halfway house patients $300 to do for them. While this man in the video may not have accepted the payment himself, he’s caught saying that Democrats are giving others in the house a $300 rebate check if they vote for Hillary in the state of California.

This is just one place where cash was probably offered for votes. We can only imagine that if her party is willing to do this there, they hit up other places and people in key states to do the same. What’s particular sick about it isn’t just that they are fraudulently obtaining votes for this woman who can’t get them on her own merit, it’s that they are targeting vulnerable people to get them as part of the dishonest plan. 
If Hillary is able to continue on with this campaign and take the White House, Americans have the duty to demand how it happened since there’s no way she could legitimately win. Had Donald Trump been caught bribing halfway house patients for votes or any of the other dishonest deeds leaked out about Hillary lately, the media would have exiled him from the election.",0

20999,’Impartial’ BBC Uses ’Nixon Impeachment’ Dog-Whistle After Trump Fires FBI Director,"The BBC, Britain’s   “impartial” broadcaster, has labelled U. S. President Donald Trump’s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey as “highly suspicious” running several articles and bulletins drawing comparisons with the Watergate scandal which brought down President Richard Nixon in 1974. [In an article on the BBC News website, titled “Did President Trump fire James Comey as part of a  ?” the corporation’s senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher speculates that “the abruptness and timing of Mr Comey’s dismissal, to put it mildly, is highly suspicious”.  “While the White House has said that the move is based on concerns over how Mr Comey handled last year’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server, not many people   …     are buying that line,” he writes, with little further elaboration. “If the dismissal was because of the email investigation, why act now?” he asks. Zurcher does, however, acknowledge that many of the Democrat politicians “howling” over Comey’s dismissal, such as Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, had previously called for the director to be axed when he announced an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s leaked emails was being reopened during the 2016 presidential election.

The article quotes former Nixon lawyer John Dean as a “prominent voice” who believes he has “been hearing echoes of Watergate ever since this presidency started” accusing the   of “dissembling”. It also states that “Russia is believed to have wanted Mr Trump to win the election [and an] unverified report apparently compiled by a private intelligence firm claimed Russia had compromising information on Mr Trump and was in a position to blackmail him” providing little in the way of explanation. It immediately follows up by pointing out that “some commentators” such as George W. Bush’s ethics lawyer Richard Painter “now fear the Russian connection could make Watergate seem trivial”.

21002,"Orlando Gunman Used Assault Rifle With Military Roots, Police Say - The New York Times","A firearm that the authorities said was used on Sunday in a mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Fla. is a descendant of one of the world’s most widely distributed and familiar infantry weapons, and a type of rifle that has been involved in previous mass shootings in the United States. Chief John Mina of the Orlando Police Department said the gunman’s weapons included a handgun and an “   assault rifle. ” The first   were designed in the 1950s by Eugene M. Stoner, a Marine and inventor, who developed the weapon to military standards and for military service. It was an atypical rifle for its time, seemingly futuristic, and made partly with lightweight plastics and aluminum that traditionalists scorned. It fired a     bullet  —   a . 223  —   that was also considered revolutionary. The rifle was capable, via a selector lever, of semiautomatic or automatic fire. In the 1960s, under Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, the Pentagon bought vast quantities of the rifle, calling it the   for American ground troops in Vietnam. The  ’s firepower and reputation for lethality were necessary, in Mr. McNamara’s view, to counter the Kalashnikov assault rifles carried by the North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong. In this way, the   and the Kalashnikov became a related pair, the assault rifle of the West springing into service as a response to the more widely distributed assault rifle of the East. A   later,   and   are made in varied forms by multiple manufacturers, and updated versions, including the   carbine, remain the standard   weapon for most American service members and many allies. Civilian versions have many trade and model names, but are generally referred to as   although this name is a rough description and does not indicate whether a particular specimen of the rifle is capable of both semiautomatic fire and automatic fire, or is semiautomatic only. The police have not said whether the weapon recovered in Orlando was capable of automatic fire. Such questions are politically contentious, although depending on a shooter’s skill and the situation, they can sometimes be moot, as aimed semiautomatic fire from a competent shooter can be far more dangerous than automatic fire, which is harder to control and is often inaccurate.   that fire only on semiautomatic are generally legal in the United States, and are widely owned by   enthusiasts. They are also sometimes used in crimes, and have been involved in some of the most deadly mass shootings in American history, including the massacre in December in San Bernardino, Calif. which killed 14 people, and the attack in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. which killed 26 people, 20 of them children. (That gunman also killed his mother at home before driving to the school.) The  ’s once unfamiliar caliber  —   commonly called 5.   —   also evolved into a military standard. The    combination can cause serious wounds, though the damage is determined partly by the type of bullet fired.

21009,Teacher Accused of Having Sex with Underage Student Grins in Mugshot,"A Texas science teacher accused of having sex with an underage student put on a grin for her mugshot when arrested. [Sarah Fowlkes, 27, was suspended from her job at Lockhart High School and faces possible prison time for the alleged crime, the Daily Mail reported.  Fowlkes was booked into the Caldwell County Jail and later released. A school administrator reported an inappropriate relationship between a student and a teacher to the police and Child Protective Services, the Houston Chronicle reported. Detectives in Lockhart interviewed a    student who said he had sexual contact with Fowlkes. Lockhart Independent School District suspended Fowlkes and notified the State Board for Educator Certification of her behavior. “Lockhart parents entrust their children to us every day, and it is something we do not take lightly,” Superintendent Susan Bohn said in the statement. “Student safety is the district’s most important priority. As soon as we learned of the report, we acted swiftly to involve law enforcement and CPS to conduct a thorough investigation. The district does not and will not tolerate any  improper communication or contact between a teacher and child. ” According to a page the school district has deleted from its website, the teacher taught anatomy, physiology, and environmental systems at Lockhart High School since September.

21011,"Bernie Promises To Keep Fighting, Hold Clinton Accountable After She’s Elected (VIDEO)","Bernie Promises To Keep Fighting, Hold Clinton Accountable After She’s Elected (VIDEO) By Richard Marcil   
Bernie Sanders is lending his full support to Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton – for now. But how long will he and Clinton remain allies? 
In a new interview , Sanders said he plans on extending his political revolution. He also intends to hold Clinton – who is expected to win the presidential election next month – to her campaign promises. The Primary and the Platform 
The Vermont senator put up a long and contentious fight against Clinton during the primary season, capturing 22 states and over 13 million votes. His populist message and democratic socialist platform proved especially popular among Millennials. 
After the primary season ended, Sanders and his cohorts were able to channel his popularity into the most progressive Democratic Party platform in history. The new platform includes support for a $15 minimum wage, aggressive action on climate change, and the dissolution of banks deemed “too big to fail” – all of which were cornerstone issues in Sanders’ campaign. Still Fighting 
Now an independent, Sanders has pledged to continue working to ensure Clinton and Congress act on the new platform. “I expect her to appoint people who will head agencies in a way that is consistent with the Democratic Party platform, and if not, I will do my best to oppose those nominees.” 
Clinton did not embrace many of the platform’s elements in her primary campaign, but has since expressed her support for them. Now Sanders and other senators are brainstorming legislation to ensure progressive policies are enacted in Washington. Elizabeth Warren, another darling of the modern progressive movement, has been “informally” working with Sanders on this legislation. Reining in Wall Street 
Specifically, he expects that Clinton will close the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. “I personally believe that a billionaire corporate executive is frankly not the kind of person that working families want to see as secretary of treasury. We need somebody who has a history of standing up to Wall Street and is prepared to take on the financial interests whose greed and illegal behavior has done so much harm.” No Compromise 
Sanders also expects that Clinton will not try to placate Republicans in an effort to bridge the political divide. Barack Obama made that mistake when he was inaugurated in 2008, and only ended up with even steeper opposition to his plans and policies. Sanders said: “It’s not good enough for me, or anybody, to say, ‘Well, look, Republicans control the House: From Day One, we’re going to have to compromise.’ The Democratic Party, before they start compromising, has got to rally the American people around our ideas and make it clear that if Republicans do not go along with reasonable ideas to benefit the middle class and the working class, they are going to pay a very heavy political price.” 
And if Clinton doesn’t follow through on Democratic platform policies and a progressive agenda? “I will be vigorously in opposition, and I will make that very clear.”

21012,Study: Rich People Less Likely to Be Interested In Your Face,"Get short URL 0 24 0 0 A new study finds (perhaps unsurprisingly) that the wealthy do not pay attention to others, perceiving them as holding less “motivational relevance."" 
Using Google Glass, a hands-free wearable computer designed to look like eyeglasses, New York University researchers sought to track the eye movements of 61 New Yorkers who were instructed to look at whatever caught their attention while walking down the street. Second Time’s the Charm? Google Reveals New Glass Wearable The Google Glass video camera, placed over the right eye, recorded their gaze. Researchers wrote in the journal Psychological Science that, although socio-economic status did not account for how often a person looked at others, there was nonetheless a correlation between class and interest in others, with wealthier people spending the least amount of time looking at others. 
Researchers theorized that ""people’s social class affects their appraisals of others’ motivational relevance—the degree to which others are seen as potentially rewarding, threatening, or otherwise worth attending to."" Here Lives a Wealthy Man: 8 Countries With the World's Richest 1% 
LiveScience wrote that the ""findings make a compelling case that social classes differ in their judgments of other people's significance,"" adding, ""…one possible explanation may be that, for people in higher social classes, other human beings hold less 'motivational relevance' — a psychology term that means how worthy of one's attention something or someone is, based on how much reward or threat might be linked with that object or person."" Google Glass can sense where a person turns their head, but not necessarily where the eyes are directed, so scientists followed up with a device that tracks eye movements, timed to street scenes in New York City.

21013,"After Outcry, Murder Charge Filed in Death of Former N.F.L. Player Joe McKnight - The New York Times","A grand jury indicted Ronald Gasser Jr. on Thursday in the fatal  shooting of the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight, handing down a   murder charge. The charge is more severe than the one that Mr. Gasser had initially faced in December, when critics complained that racial bias may have affected the investigation. If convicted, Mr. Gasser, 54, would face life in prison with no parole. The death of Mr. McKnight, 28, a star running back at the University of Southern California who later played for the Jets and Kansas City Chiefs in the N. F. L. spurred several days of protests. Supporters and Mr. McKnight’s former teammates were outraged after the police initially freed Mr. Gasser. Though the authorities said Mr. Gasser had admitted to the shooting on Dec. 1, he was not arrested and charged until four days later. Mr. Gasser was initially charged with manslaughter over what the authorities described as a “road rage” confrontation in Terrytown, La. about five miles southeast of New Orleans. “Subsequent to that arrest, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s Office continued working together in a collaborative effort to develop additional evidence regarding the case,” the district attorney’s office said in a statement Thursday. “Today’s indictment comes as a result of that joint effort. ” Mr. Gasser’s bond was also increased to $750, 000. The delayed arrest and lesser initial charge had angered critics, who said that Mr. Gasser, the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business, may have been afforded more leeway because he is white, or that the authorities were less invested in swift justice for a black man’s death. In a fiery response after the initial arrest, Sheriff Newell Normand of Jefferson Parish defended the pace of the investigation, saying the authorities needed time to build a better case in a state that has strong Stand Your Ground   laws. Investigators conducted more than 160 interviews and spoke to Mr. Gasser for more than 12 hours, Sheriff Normand said at a news conference in December. “Justice has no time period,” he said. “Justice is not a sprint. It is a marathon. These investigations are marathons. ” The confrontation began around 2:45 p. m. after both men were driving erratically, cutting each other off and zipping in front of each other, Sheriff Normand said. Mr. Gasser became irate and engaged in a “verbal altercation” with Mr. McKnight, the sheriff said. When they stopped next to each other at a red light, Mr. McKnight got out of his car and approached the window of Mr. Gasser’s car, the sheriff said. Mr. Gasser then pulled out a handgun from between his seat and the console and shot Mr. McKnight three times, according to the sheriff.",0

Given the Russians’ recent threats regarding the potential election of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, this is not good news. 
“Americans voting for a president on Nov. 8 must realize that they are voting for peace on Planet Earth if they vote for Trump,” veteran Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky said earlier this month, according to Reuters .   
“But if they vote for Hillary, it’s war,” he continued. “It will be a short movie. There will be Hiroshimas and Nagasakis everywhere.” 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has himself reportedly also made threats, warning of a potential “confrontation” were Clinton to continue prodding Russia with allegations that it has been attempting to rig the U.S. presidential election. 
“Jeopardizing Russian-American relations in order to gain brownie points internally — I consider this to be harmful and counterproductive,” Putin reportedly said this week. “It’s not funny anymore. If somebody out there wants confrontation, this is not our choice but this means that there will be problems.”  ",0

21033,Syrian Refugee in Germany Gets $390K in Annual Benefits. And It's Because of Who He Takes Care Of,"
The impact of the Syrian refugee crisis has been felt worldwide. 
While it has helped make immigration a central issue in the U.S. presidential elections, one of the most affected countries has been Germany — with Pew noting that the nation received “442,000 asylum applications in 2015 alone.” 
Now, a report has emerged from Germany that just one of these immigrants is claiming nearly $400,000 in benefits from the government, due to the fact that he arrived in the country with his four wives... and 23 children. Europe going mad: Syrian refugee in Germany claiming benefits for his 4 wives and 22 children. https://t.co/Cmcn550fym — Michael Heaver (@Michael_Heaver) October 26, 2016 
The man — who has been identified only as Ghazia A. — is allowed to have multiple wives under Muslim tradition, but only if he can support them financially. 
Upon emigrating to Germany, where polygamy is not officially permitted but officials have been 'looking the other way,' Ghazia was forced to choose just one of his four wives as his “main” wife. 
He then split up his 22 children — one has since married and moved to Saudi Arabia — among the other three. These family members were placed in neighboring homes, some up to 31 miles away. 
Ghazia explained to German newspaper Das Bild how his wide-ranging family responsibilities have left him unable to work: 
""According to our religion I have the duty to visit each family equally and not to prioritize any of them. 
I am practically always on my way to be with my family — yet I would gladly like to work."" 
Noting that “regardless of how one evaluates facts morally, it is never wrong to know the hard numbers,” one German financial manager calculated the state benefits Ghazia would receive for his massive family. 
According to his estimate , it comes out to roughly $390,000 per year in U.S. dollars. Germany: Syrian Refugee with 4 Wives and 23 Children Claims £320,000 a year in benefits https://t.co/lU2ED6dSn9 — Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) October 26, 2016 
While much of the criticism surrounding America's acceptance of refugees has centered on concerns of terrorism , similar cultural clashes have also been seen in the U.S. 
In August, one refugee family brought a lawsuit against the Pennsylvania school they were placed in, arguing it's not the school they “deserved.” Lawsuit: Expert calls pace at Phoenix Academy ‘totally inappropriate’ for refugee students https://t.co/8AW75hF7tY #LNPinsider #FridayReads — LancasterOnline.com (@LancasterOnline) August 19, 2016 
Other, larger concerns have also emerged about the potential culture clash that could come as a result of accepting huge numbers of refugees, particularly involving women. 
Some have argued that the “brutal ideology in Muslim majority countries” that many refugees were raised to practice places women in Western countries at risk of both sexual assault and violence. 
In September, German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted that she had lost control of her “open-door” refugee policy, even expressing that she would “turn back time” if she could. 
With Ghazia's case representing just one situation causing backlash from her citizens, it's not difficult to see why. ",0

Asumiendo al fin que no es rentable que el AVE Madrid-Barcelona se detenga en Calatayud, Renfe ha informado esta semana que la estación de la localidad consistirá a partir de la semana que viene en un colchón situado en el suelo y junto a las vías para que los pasajeros que quieran apearse puedan tirarse desde el tren en marcha sin lastimarse. “Es una estación modelo Pikolín que sustituirá a la actual, que será derribada”, ha explicado un portavoz de la operadora ferroviaria esta mañana. 
La estación del tren de alta velocidad situada en Calatayud medirá 135×90 centímetros y dispondrá del primer andén viscoelástico de Europa, según defiende Renfe. El procedimiento para que los pasajeros del tren, que viaja a una media de 250 kilómetros por hora, puedan apearse en Calatayud consistirá en situarse en una de las puertas y recibir un pequeño empujón de un miembro de la tripulación. 
La asistencia de la tripulación será esencial para calcular la trayectoria correcta hacia el colchón, explica la compañía española. 
Renfe no ha querido detallar qué procedimiento deberán seguir los viajeros que deseen subir al tren. La compañía está haciendo pruebas para ver si una persona puede correr en paralelo al convoy y saltar al interior mientras varios ejecutivos le gritan “vamos, vamos, corre” desde la ventanilla. 
“En el caso de obligar a los ejecutivos a subir a los trenes en marcha, habilitaríamos un vagón de mercancías con un gran portón de madera y tres ejecutivos vagabundos en el interior que tocarían la armónica y explicarían leyendas del Ibex”, ha explicado el portavoz.",0

Close Intuihub officials say the particular thing needs to incorporate the latest technology if it wants to stay relevant. NEWS October 26, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 42 · News · Technology 
SAN FRANCISCO—Explaining how their company was poised to usher in a bold new era of innovation, founders of local startup Intuihub told reporters Wednesday that their mission is to explore the intersection of technology and another thing. 
“When you look at where the world is going right now, it just makes a lot of sense to take cutting-edge technology and incorporate it into this other thing,” said Intuihub co-founder Martin Fiske, who explained that the other thing will be modernized and streamlined once it is integrated with the latest technological breakthroughs. “We’re looking out at an exciting new frontier, one in which technology will be used to push the boundaries of what the other thing is capable of.” 
“And we believe there’s no limit to what we can accomplish when we take technology and the other thing and put them together,” Fiske added. 
Intuihub will reportedly employ groundbreaking advancements in technology to take the other thing in a variety of new and intriguing directions, including some directions, company officials promised, that have never before been imagined. According to the startup’s founders, their work will forever change the way people think about and interact with the thing. 
Fiske, who reportedly began his career working solely with the other thing but soon realized that adding technology to what he was doing would “open amazing new doors for the thing,” told reporters that his company has an incredible opportunity to revolutionize both technology and the other thing. Five years from now, he said, the thing is likely to be completely unrecognizable by today’s standards. 
He pointed out that Intuihub is already disrupting the entire landscape by using technology to make the other thing more accessible and convenient. 
“Technology is evolving, and the other thing needs to evolve along with it,” said Fiske, noting that no other company focusing on the other thing is using technology the way Intuihub is. “The synergy between technology and this thing will be so strong that when the two come together, they may actually create a third thing, one that we believe could be truly world-altering.” 
After describing their plans to launch a revolution that will change the lives of millions for the better, Intuihub founders confirmed they were also interested in partnering with brands to create more personalized experiences for the thing’s consumers.

21039,Dem: Charge Republican Who Took Down Anti-Cop Painting - Breitbart,"Representative Lacy Clay (  ) wants Representative Duncan Hunter (  ) to face “theft” charges for removing an   painting from the walls of the U. S. Capitol complex. [Breitbart News previously reported that the painting was hung in the Capitol complex after Clay chose it as a fitting representation of the August 9, 2014, shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. It depicts police officers as animals with tusks.  On January 6 Hunter removed the painting from the wall, saying, “I’ve seen the press [reporting on this painting] for about a week or so.   …     I’m in the Marine Corps. If you want it done, just call us. ” Hunter then delivered the painting to Clay’s office and said, “Lacy can put it back up, I guess, if he wants to   …     but I’m allowed to take it down. ” Clay now wants “theft” charges against Hunter. According to The Washington Post, Clay addressed the removal of the painting on Monday, saying that “his staff met Monday with members of the Capitol Police to press theft charges against Rep. Duncan D. Hunter. ” Clay added, “He had no right to take that picture down, it’s thievery. ” Clay plans to rehang the   painting on January 10 and will be accompanied by the Congressional Black Caucus while doing it. The artist behind the painting is David Pulphus. Clay defended Pulphus’ animal representation of officers in Ferguson, saying: These are his impressions. Those are his feelings. That’s how he formed his opinion, and he expressed it in his art. So what’s wrong with that? Any black parent would tell you that they have to have this conversation with their children about police and how to act around them, so that’s the conversation we need to be having here. Not about taking some kid’s picture off the wall  —   it should be about, how do we change these attitudes and improve the relationships between police and the black community? The schism between Clay and Hunter over attitudes toward police officers is a microcosm of the larger divide that exists between the Democrat Party and the Republican Party. For example, during the 2016 presidential race the National Fraternal Order of Police (NFOP) sent Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton a questionnaire to answer. She did not even bother returning it to them. NFOP president Chuck Canterbury said he was “disappointed and shocked. ” Approximately a month later the NFOP endorsed Donald Trump for president. The Hill quoted Canterbury saying, “[Trump] has seriously looked at the issues facing law enforcement today.

According to the LAPD, vandal James Otis was arrested on Thursday. ABC News reported that Otis — heir to the Otis Elevator family and grandson of the man who invented Listerine — remains unapologetic for his actions. He gave a brief statement with his attorney present: 
""I'm not at all ashamed of what I've done. What Mr. Trump has done is he's derailed the entire election. I got so upset. I got so frustrated and angry and that's why I did this. 
I admitted my mistakes. And I'm now dealing with my consequences. Unlike Mr. Trump who has never admitted what he's done."" 
Otis also claimed that his intent was to auction off the Trump nameplate after he removed it from the sidewalk, giving the proceeds to the women that Trump has allegedly sexually assaulted. However, he was forced to return the nameplate upon his arrest Thursday. ",0

21045,Sen. Chuck Schumer Goes Off on Trump Supporter at Fancy NYC Restaurant,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) reportedly went on a tirade at a “swanky” Manhattan restaurant Sunday night, screaming at a wealthy patron over her support for President Trump. [Schumer lost his temper when dining at Upper East Side restaurant Sette Mezzo, the New York Post’s Page Six reported.  The top Senate Democrat was dining with friends when he ran into former U. S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr. and his wife, Hilary, at the restaurant. Witnesses say that Schumer became incensed that Hilary, daughter of CBS founder and chairman William S. Paley, voted for Trump, though her husband is a prominent Democrat. “They are a highly respected couple, and Schumer made a scene, yelling, ‘She voted for Trump!’ The Califanos left the restaurant, but Schumer followed them outside,” one witness said of the encounter. “How could you vote for Trump? He’s a liar! He’s a liar!” Schumer reportedly yelled. Hilary confirmed the encounter with Schumer and called the senator’s actions “really rude. ” “Sen. Schumer was really rude   …     He’s our senator, and I don’t really like him. Yes, I voted for Trump. Schumer joined us outside and he told me Trump was a liar. I should have told him that Hillary Clinton was a liar, but I was so surprised I didn’t say anything,” Hilary said. Another witness told a different story about Schumer’s encounter with the couple, saying the senator approached the couple’s table first. “It was a pleasant conversation. Joe said the senator was doing a good job on health care. Joe joked that Hilary voted for Trump. The conversation continued outside because everyone left at the same time,” the witness said. In a statement, Schumer’s spokesperson denied that there was a heated encounter at the restaurant. “[He] and his wife ate at the café on Sunday, engaging in unremarkable conversation with patrons who approached their table. There were no heated exchanges with ‎anyone,” the spokesperson said. Schumer has railed against the Trump administration, saying Sunday that President Trump’s proposal for a border wall will not get votes from Republicans or Democrats. He also called on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( ) to replace House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Devin Nunes ( ) and announced that Senate Democrats will filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court.",0
21046,"When You Have to Go, Japanese Rest Stops Won’t Keep You Waiting - The New York Times","The kids are hungry, the driver has a headache and everyone has to go to the bathroom. If you’re traveling by car on a holiday weekend, the last thing you want to find at a roadside rest stop is a long line for a toilet. Companies that run major highway service plazas in Japan go to considerable lengths to ensure you never will, as they compete for the coveted Japan Toilet Award from the transportation ministry. Nexco Central Nippon Expressway, which runs 200 of the rest stops, promises that patrons should never have to wait more than two minutes to use the lavatory. The company’s   Neopasa Shimizu stop, one of several near Shizuoka City, about 15 miles from Mount Fuji, shows how. To keep things moving at Neopasa Shimizu, where 25, 000 people may stop on a busy weekend, there are 72 stalls in the ladies’ room, compared with 14 stalls and 32 urinals in the men’s  —   a ratio meant to combat the longer waits that women often encounter in public facilities. Technology is put to work, too. A sensor in each stall detects whether it is in use, and relays that information to a large monitor screen mounted outside the restroom. Small icons even indicate whether the available toilets are the Western sitting style or the traditional Japanese squatting style. Of course, those who find these elaborate status panels too confusing can always just walk up and down the stalls, looking for an unlocked door.",0

21050,"Texas County Enacts ""Emergency Paper Ballots"" After ""Software Glitch"" In Voting Machines","  Texas County Enacts ""Emergency Paper Ballots"" After ""Software Glitch"" In Voting Machines Oct 26, 2016 1:50 PM 0 SHARES 
Just yesterday we noted several social media complaints from Texas voters who alleged that when they voted a straight republican ticket that voting machines were switching their presidential selection to Clinton/Kaine. While most undoubtedly dismissed these reports as conspiracy theories, new official reports from Chambers County, Texas suggest that there might be some truth to the voting machine ""irregularities"". According to an NBC affiliate , polling stations in Chambers County had to enact emergency protocols yesterday and revert back to paper ballots after a ""glitch"" was discovered in the county's voting machines. 
The issue was actually discovered on Monday morning when Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne was casting her own ballot and the voter next to her noticed that one of her votes was not filled in when she reviewed her electronic ballot Hawthorne told 12News on Tuesday. 

An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County. 

ES&S is the vendor that Chambers County contracts with to program their voting machines. 

The Texas Secretary of State's office informed Hawthorne to create emergency paper ballots to continue voting until the problem could be fixed according to the release. 
Below is the official press release from the Chambers County Clerk: 

Of course, these confirmed reports from Chambers County seem eerily similar to problems reported yesterday on social media from people who also experienced problems when voting a ""straight republican ticket."" 

The following report also surfaced in Arlington, Texas from a person who voted a straight republican ticket only to find just before submitting her ballot that her presidential choice had been switched to Clinton/Kaine . After reporting the error to polling officials, the voter was told that these errors ""had been happening."" 

This Reddit user also noted multiple reports of voting errors across the state of Texas. 

Of course, the real question is how many people submitted erroneous ballots before this ""glitch"" was caught and how many other ""software glitches"" exist in other counties around the country that will never be caught?",0

21055,"Orlando Medical Examiner: ‘Take a Typical Homicide Scene, Multiply It by 50’ - The New York Times","ORLANDO, Fla.  —   Corpses do not faze him but Joshua D. Stephany, Orlando’s chief medical examiner, still has the image of what he saw inside the Pulse nightclub on the morning of the slaughter seared into his head. Strobe lights were still flashing. The television was still on. Purses and cellphones were strewn about the floor. And there were bodies everywhere. “What you saw was drinks that were just served. You saw bills that were about to be paid. You saw   food,” said Dr. Stephany, 41, who was called into duty hours after Omar Mateen barged into the popular gay nightclub and opened fire.   people were killed in the attack. “Time just stopped. ” Although he had been filling in for about a year, Dr. Stephany was officially made Orange County’s chief medical examiner two days after the slaughter at Pulse. On his first real day on the job, his office completed 18 autopsies. He said he performed at least seven of the 49 autopsies. The exact number he is not certain of. He lost count. He and his four colleagues, aided by two state pathologists called in from elsewhere in Florida, have now conducted autopsies on all 49 victims as well as the assailant. Out of respect for those who were killed, Mr. Mateen’s corpse is being held in a different part of the morgue, in an area typically used for decomposing bodies. Determining the cause of death was routine in this case, as all of the victims had bullet wound after bullet wound. “So you kind of take a typical homicide scene, multiply it by 50, even that just won’t prepare you for what you see,” he said. “I don’t think you can find anybody more experienced than medical examiners to go to that type of events, but to see the sheer number of decedent is almost surreal. ” The pathologists put aside their emotions, he said, as they sought to identify everyone. The technicians photographed,   and fingerprinted the bodies to confirm their identities. They inspected tattoos. They washed blood off the victims’ faces so they could be compared to photographs from their driver’s licenses and Facebook profiles. The identity of one victim frustrated the team for dozens of hours, until Dr. Stephany realized that a wallet he had picked up off the ground at the club as evidence contained the person’s name. In autopsy after autopsy, the doctors documented every wound and plucked every bullet, noting where it entered and the direction it traveled. “It doesn’t appear anyone suffered,” he said. “Everyone went down where they were. I don’t think anyone had prolonged suffering. ” A New Hampshire native, Dr. Stephany has conducted several thousand autopsies in his life. He has seen his share of overdoses, suicides, hangings and car crashes. But he said he knows this case, his first as the chief, will be one he will not forget. “It hasn’t been able to sink in yet,” Dr. Stephany said. “I don’t think there’s any way it could not affect you immediately or eventually. ”",0

21058,US Supreme Court: Transgender Bathroom in Schools,"US Supreme Court: Transgender Bathroom in Schools November 02, 2016 
For the first time the US Supreme Court will take up the issue of Transgender Bathrooms being forced on schoolchildren. 
The transgender bathroom and locker room issue has been debated in states across America since President Obama earlier this year publicly announced that Title IX anti-discrimination law includes transgender self-identity, he even weighed in specifically on the particular case in Virginia that has made it's way to the Supreme Court. Caitlyn Hope, a 17-year-old began to self-identify as a boy in 2014. She has not undergone sex change surgery but is undergoing hormone therapy. Caitlyn legally changed her name to Gavin and started to use the boys' showers, toilets, and locker rooms at school. 
""This is the first time that the Court will be addressing the question of whether laws protecting against sex discrimination in education are applicable to 'gender identity,'” Liberty Counsel noted. 
Parents voiced their concerns when hearing about what was happening at the school. Despite school board attempts to accommodate by building private, single-stall bathrooms and to keep school common bathrooms gender separate, they were sued. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought a lawsuit on Caitlyn's behalf, demanding that she may use all of the school's facilities. It is expected that the Supreme Court ruling next year will have direct impact on community bathroom laws, such as North Carolina's HB2, which keeps public bathrooms gender separate. 
There are currently only eight justices on the Supreme Court, and with Republicans disallowing hearings on Obama’s nominees, either pro-transgender Hillary Clinton or pro-life Donald Trump will nominate someone to fill the vacancy. On November 8th YOU will decide!

«Властям Сирии был представлен план по доставке гуманитарных конвоев на ноябрь. Он включает запросы на оказание помощи 904 500 человек в 25 труднодоступных и осаждённых районах», — приводит РИА Новости слова заместителя генерального секретаря ООН по гуманитарным вопросам Стивена О'Брайена. 
В октябре количество районов, куда был разрешён доступ гуманитарным конвоям, составляло 29. При этом, по словам дипломата, доступ не был получен к восточному Алеппо, а также трём областям в провинции Дамаск. 
Согласно данным ООН, в осаждённых и труднодоступных районах Сирии проживает почти 5,5 млн человек. Подписывайтесь на наш Telegram , чтобы быть в курсе самых важных новостей. Для этого достаточно иметь Telegram на любом устройстве, пройти по ссылке и нажать кнопку Join.",0
21060,"Police One: Conditioning Britons to ’Run, Hide, Tell’ Does Not Demonstrate Resolve","In the wake of the June 3 London Bridge attacks, Police One warns that conditioning Britons to “run, hide, tell” does not demonstrate resolve. [Instead they show that the tactic reveals “an aversion to the use of force in   [which] may embolden  …     terrorists. ”  Police One praises the Brits who did what they could to buy time by throwing drink glasses, bar stools, etc. at the London attackers. The response was not without demonstrations of courage. But the overarching mindset of “run, hide, tell”  instead of “Move! Escape or Attack!” betrays a conditioning that seeks a means of retreat instead of a means of counteraction it is a response from a position of weakness instead of a position of strength. Police One quotes Winston Churchill’s 1940 address to the House of Commons: We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender. But the word “fight” does not appear to be in the lexicon of those behind 21st century social and psychological conditioning in Britain.  And this is tragic because some people will be forced to fight for their lives. Police One explains, “Yet, in the end, there may be no other alternative for the public but to fight. Running and hiding may work, depending on the circumstances and a person’s proximity to the epicenter of an attack, but for some people, there will be no suitable alternative but fighting. ” The lack of emphasis on “fighting” is part of a paradigm that impacts the Metropolitan Police as well. After all, “the majority of British police officers are not trusted with lethal force tools and the officers who are actually equipped with firearms operate in a culture where their use is highly discouraged by authorities. ” So it comes as not surprise that one of the officers near the June 3 terror attacks had only a “club” for both an offensive and defensive tool. Police One asks, “Is it possible that the British are emboldening these attackers by failing to demonstrate their resolve and their commitment to confronting evil with force?” They suggest Churchill would answer in the affirmative.

21064,Failed weapons systems cost Pentagon $58 billion over two decades,"Failed weapons systems cost Pentagon $58 billion over two decades Published time: 26 Oct, 2016 19:47 Get short URL The Pentagon building in Washington, DC. © AFP The Pentagon loves to throw good money after bad ‒ to the tune of nearly $60 billion on failed big-ticket weapons systems over the last two decades, according to a new internal Department of Defense review. 
From the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) that focused on fighting the last war to its RAH-66 Comanche stealth helicopters that never quite got off the ground, between 1997 and October 2016, the Pentagon invested $58 billion on weapons technology it never received. That doesn’t include the boondoggle that is the F-35 jet , which was finally declared “ready for combat” at the beginning of August. 
The FCS ($20 billion) and the Comanche ($9.8 billion) are just two of 23 major weapons programs that were canceled before they were finished, and together the two Army projects made up more than 50 percent of the “sunk costs” outlined in the Pentagon’s annual internal acquisitions performance review. The 224-page report by Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall was published earlier this week. Read more 5 costly Pentagon projects of dubious merit 
The report noted how much money was spent on each canceled program, how far along in the process they were before they were killed, and if any of the technology was rolled up into new programs. For example, although the FCS was canceled, parts of it ‒ including many of the manned ground vehicles and the Intelligent Munitions System ‒ were swept up into a current program called the Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Program. 
Most of the programs were killed before they blew through their budgets, but eight of them spent all the money allotted to them before the Pentagon canceled them, the report found. 
The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, conducted an audit of Pentagon spending in 2011 and found $70 billion in waste, the New York Times reported at the time . Much of the overspending happened because the DOD started building weapons systems before the designs were fully tested, the auditors said. 
With acquisitions overruns long being a thorn in the side of the Pentagon’s budget, in March the Air Force enlisted IBM’s Jeopardy! -winning cognitive computer , Watson. Two contractors are currently working to create programs that would enable Watson to navigate the 1,897-page Federal Acquisition Regulation, helping potential government vendors actually bid for military contracts. The project is expected to become operational by 2018. 
Another way the Pentagon has sought to cut down wasted spending is through the latest update to its acquisitions program, called ‘Better Buying Power 3.0’, which was announced in April 2015 . The program was designed to have “a stronger emphasis on innovation, technical excellence, and the quality of our products,” Kendall wrote in a memo ordering the program's implementation. It calls on the military-industrial complex to make projects more affordable in terms of funding, schedule and manpower throughout the entire lifespan of their products. It will also reward contractors for successful expense management, and ask them to eliminate unproductive processes and unnecessary bureaucracy. 
Of course, holding contractors accountable for their failures when it comes to major cost overruns or weapons systems that don’t work is easier said than done. And it doesn’t help when someone at the Pentagon thinks it’s a good idea to spend money on bomb-sniffing elephants .",0

21066,New bionic eye implant connects directly to brain,"New bionic eye implant connects directly to brain 11/03/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY Scientists may have made a significant breakthrough in restoring human sight, as a woman who had been blind for seven years has regained the ability to see shapes and colours with a bionic eye implant. 
The 30-year-old woman had a wireless visual stimulator chip inserted into her brain by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) surgeons in the first human test of the product. As a result, she could see colored flashes, lines, and spots when signals were sent to her brain from a computer. 
The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, suffered no significant adverse side effects in the process, according to a statement. 
The device, which was developed as part of the Orion 1 programme by Second Sight, uses technology to restore sight by bypassing the optic nerve to stimulate the brain’s visual cortex, according to chairman Robert Greenberg. 
It is designed for those who cannot benefit from the Argus II retinal system that was unveiled at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital last year, but has limited application, as it depends on the patient having some retinal cells. 
This new system goes one step further by sending signals directly to the brain. It has the potential to restore sight to those who have gone completely blind for virtually any reason, including glaucoma, cancer, diabetic retinopathy, or trauma, according to the manufacturer. 
The next step is to connect the implant to a camera on a pair of glasses, and the company plans to seek FDA approval in 2017 to get the go ahead to conduct these trials. 
UCLA neurosurgeon Nader Pouratian, who implanted the stimulator, said the results of the surgery are promising. 
“Based on these results, stimulation of the visual cortex has the potential to restore useful vision to the blind, which is important for independence and improving quality of life,” he said.",0

21069,Comment on West Point Academy And Children Are The New Champions For Gay Marriage by para para dinle,"West Point Academy And Children Are The New Champions For Gay Marriage By Jonathan Lenhardt on November 4, 2013 Subscribe 
Another day, another bit of ground my socially conservative Republican counterparts have lost on the gay marriage debate. This past Saturday, November 2, 2013 West Point Military Academy’s Cadet Chapel hosted the first ever male same-sex marriage ceremony . This follows two female same-sex marriages late in 2012. 
Needless to say, somebody at the academy has decided to join the 21st Century and not a moment too soon; gay marriage was made legal in New York State way back in mid-2011 . Still, long time coming aside, it was a huge day for West Point graduates 28-year-old Larry Choate III (Class of 2009), and 27-year-old Daniel Lennox (Class of 2007), and we at Liberal America sent our congratulations. 
Sadly, however, there is still a raging debate on gay marriage and whether or not it should be made legal courtesy of the Big G, (U.S. Federal Government). Fifty two percent of Americans say yes according to a Gallup poll conducted this past July, and we already know what we, here at The Liberal Conservative , think about federal laws on not just gay marriage but marriage in general – spoiler alert: we’re for gay marriage, just not via federal law. 
Now the thing that the far-right, Tea Party-indoctrinated “Republicans,” have to realize is that there is a certain group of people to which they have fallen behind on this matter, and many others. This is a group of people that they should be ashamed and embarrassed to have fallen behind. This is a group of people who have proven to be more mature, more merciful, kinder, and warmer than they are. 
Children . 
If you’ve ever checked out any of the ?Kids React To…? videos on YouTube such as the one above or this one or – more importantly – this one , then you’re familiar with the work of The Fine Brothers , Benny and Rafi. They’ve been at this for a while now and, as The Daily Dot explains, when they’re not getting kids’ reactions to things like, Nyan Cat, Justin Bieber, or Rebecca Black, they have their delightful cast of youngsters tackling issues like race relations, rape culture, bullying, and, yes, ?gay marriage. 
Thirteen children were asked to react to videos of same-sex marriage proposals and offer their opinion. With the exception of a single young boy, the children reacted universally positive; and then with anger when they inevitably discover that not everybody is allowed to marry who they love in the United States – the “freest” nation on Earth. 
To the proposals themselves the kids, Californians aged 5 to 13 years, were floored by the displays of love they were fortunate to witness in the videos. And when he discovered the truth about gay marriage in America young Dylan wondered: 
Why would you be that mean to someone? 
Indeed. Why would we be that mean to someone? 
Someone in the audience yells “Religion!” and I roll my eyes in disappointed concurrence. 
This author’s personal favorite reaction comes from 5-year-old Lucas who, apart from looking gloriously like Zachary Quinto as Spock, turns to one of the Fines after the first video and asks “So, they’re gay?” When this is confirmed he simply lets out a nonchalant and confirming, “Oh.” Standing against gay marriage is..illogical.",0
21071,Chicago Tribune Editor Says Facebook’s Anti-Fake News Algorithm is Killing Their Traffic - Breitbart,"The deputy editor of the Chicago Tribune has accused Facebook of causing a decline in their web traffic, blaming the social network’s new algorithm, which is designed to surface “accurate” and “relevant” stories. [In a post on Medium, Tribune deputy editor Kurt Gessler revealed that the paper had seen a rapid decline in its median Facebook organic post reach after November, with the number of articles being read by fewer than 10, 000 readers “skyrocketing,” according to Gessler’s analysis of the data.   (Via Kurt  . com) Facebook did change its algorithms around the same time the Tribune’s median traffic began to drop. In January, Facebook’s “trending news” feature was changed from its previous model, which tailored results to the personal preferences and interests of users, to one which surfaced news based on geographical region. According to reports, the change was introduced to favor   “real news” over “fake news. ” The Chicago Tribune, of course, is one of the most influential and respected mainstream papers in the U. S. and clearly considered itself a part of the mainstream media’s fight against “fake news,” which reached a height in the weeks and months immediately following Donald Trump’s election. “We are going to point out fake news when we see it,” The Tribune’s Facebook account posted in late December. In January, Facebook also changed the algorithm of its users’ news feeds, again with a focus on finding “real news. ” According to Facebook, the new algorithm would “incorporat[e] new signals to better identify and rank authentic content. ” The algorithm is also intended to surface “timely” and “relevant” content. This is what Gissler  —   who does not believe a paper as mainstream and respectable and established as the Chicago Tribune could ever be accused of peddling fake news, much less admitting to it and correcting themselves afterwards  —   believes is hurting his paper. Given that I hope the Tribune passes muster for “authentic,” let’s focus on the second half. What exact signals are being used to determine what “timely” means? It purports to favor topics that are being discussed in real time. In addition to rejecting the idea that the Chicago Tribune might not always publish authentic content, Gissler also fails to consider that the   of the paper’s drop in traffic is also right after the general election. While some news sites have avoided a   slump, others, like Slate and Politico, saw traffic declines of 40 percent or more after the election. The legacy news industry is increasingly troubled by the power of Facebook and Google, which together are extending their dominant position in digital advertising. The British press industry publication Press Gazette recently launched a campaign against the   “duopoly” of Google and Facebook, urging them to cut old media in on their ad revenue, as well as do more to tackle “fake news. ” If Gissler’s suspicions are correct, however, tackling “fake news” might not get legacy media the results they wanted.

Frequent panelist on Times Then Now’s prime-time debate program, The Newshour, AAP spokesperson, The Ashutosh burst into tears on camera yet again, thanks to the sheer joy of being able to hear his own voice and the overwhelming feeling of being able to complete his sentence fully without being interrupted. (Image via intoday.in) 
The former IBN7 editor described his emotional experience to The UnReal Times , but not before asking “The Modi” to answer for his own emotional outburst. “There is the Youtube video of the deff babie who is able to hear the human voices, including his own, for the first time, after being fitted with the hereing aide. The babie’s joy is just prizeless !!! That is exactly how I felt when I was able to hear my own voice on the Newshour for the first time !!! Not only that, I was also able to fully complite my sentence without any interruptions !!! It’s an unbelivable feeling !!! My wife told me that the Mogu and the Chhotu also started crying on seeing me crying on the TV !!!” The Ashutosh exclaimed. 
Recounting his earlier experiences on the Arnab era Newshour, the AAP spokesperson said, “With the Arnab, I could not hear my own voice and I still used to talk. Once in a while, the audiance wud laugh after I said something and I used to realize that way that I had said something stupid, like filibusting or simply ‘the’ing random people or things. Also, I figured out that I would never really be able to complete any sentence, so I started shortening my sentences to 2-3 words, like in the bank-e-scam episoade. Of course, soon later, AAP boycoatted the Arnab. Now, thank the God, there is no need for all these struggles !!! The journalism is back in the Times Now !!!” 
While being strong opponents in every other topic under the sun, in this regard, however, The Ashutosh found strong consonance from rival spokesperson, the BJP’s Sambit Patra. “I can fully understand what The Ashu went through and how he must’ve also finally felt yesterday. I too, could often never hear what I myself used to squeal but soon enough, even though the topic would be in our favor, the hot seat would somehow shift to mine and I would often be blasted for something the Congress or the AAP did. Even though I haven’t gone to the post-Arnab Newshour, I can fully feel what The Ashu feels,” Patra added. 
According to sources, the Congress party too, is mulling a return to The Newshour. “Boy, I can’t wait to return to the Newshour and finally be able to talk about 2002 at length,” a thrilled Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha exclaimed. Tweet About Ashwin Kumar

21082,University of Wisconsin Students Demand Free Tuition for Black Students,"A group of mostly white students at the University of   is demanding that the school offer a wholly free education to black students, even if they are convicted criminals. [The group, the Associated Students of Madison, demanded that the school offer free tuition, free living expenses, and cancel all fees for all African American students as a form of “reparations” for the practice of slavery that ended 150 years ago, Fox News reported.  “The university’s rhetoric suggests that it is committed to diversity and inclusion, so this legislation compels the university to move towards action  —   which is imperative,” said the resolution’s author, ASM Student Council Rep. Tyriek Mack. “If no one challenges the university’s empty promises, then the racial composition will remain stagnant. ” Calling it the “Cognitive Dissonance Resolution,” the ASM policy proposal demands free tuition for all black people, including formerly incarcerated criminals. Free tuition, free housing, and no fees would save a black student up to $20, 000 a year. The resolution also demands that universities spend ten percent of their donations on financial aid. Another provision called on the school to weigh admittance by geographical regions, instead of grades. While black students make up only two percent of the student body, University spokeswoman Meredith McGlone insisted that the proportion of students of color has grown from 11 to 15 percent under current administration policies, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. On the other hand, the State of Wisconsin itself is only six percent black, while the U. S. population is 12 percent black. In the end, McGlone said that some of the things the student group wants are not even legal. “It’s unclear that the methods that they’re suggesting are either legal or the best approach to accomplishing those goals,” McGlone said.

21084,Prescription Painkiller Deaths Dropped 25% in States That Legalized Marijuana,"In all states that have legalized medical marijuana, there has been a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers. There is still heated controversy in the United States about whether or not marijuana should be legalized for recreational use, let alone medicinal purposes. 
Via HumansAreFree 

After reviewing a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014, you’ll likely agree that it’s much safer for cannabis to be doled out than most prescription opioids. For the study, researchers analyzed all deaths caused by opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2010 in the U.S.

Then, they determined the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic-related deaths using linear time-series regression models. The various models helped the researchers determine that in every state that legalized medical marijuana between the aforementioned years (a total of 13 states), there was a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers. “The difference is quite striking,” said Colleen Barry, the study’s co-author and health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, to Newsweek.
It is hypothesized by the researchers that in states where medical marijuana is legal, patients are opting to smoke cannabis to alleviate their pain rather than consume prescription opiates, as the latter tend to cause side effects.
In addition, marijuana accounts for 0 deaths per year, whereas overdose of opiates are responsible for over 14,000 deaths annually (source). While the statistics speak volumes, not everyone is in agreement with the findings.
Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer at the national non-profit addiction treatment agency Phoenix House, says that the immediate reduction in overdose deaths is extremely unlikely to be a result of the herb being substituted. This, he says, is because physicians rarely prescribe marijuana for chronic pain.
“You don’t have primary care doctors in these states [prescribing] marijuana instead of Vicodin,” he argues.
The physician believes that the states that have legalized medical marijuana are more likely to actively treat and help prevent addiction. In his mind, this is a far more likely scenario for the decrease in overdose deaths. While more studies undoubtedly need to be carried out to pinpoint the cause of this phenomenon, this news is heartening at the very least.

21089,"PARIS: After destruction begins on their squatters camps, Muslim illegals scream that they are “humans, not beasts”","PARIS: After destruction begins on their squatters camps, Muslim illegals scream that they are “humans, not beasts” But nobody is buying it. Illegal alien Muslim invaders have staged a mass protest in Paris over their treatment by French authorities following destruction of their makeshift camps. Masses of Muslim freeloaders sleeping in the streets joined local bleeding hearts to demonstrate at their encampment near the Stalingrad Metro station. UK Daily Mail (h/t therezam) One man held up a sign saying ‘human, no beast’ as a man used a loud speaker to lead the march, which happened late last night. It came 24 hours after violence broke out at the site with gangs of men attacking each other using sticks as makeshift clubs. The fighting unfolded just hours after demolition workers supported by riot police began smashing up an illegal camp full of UK-bound migrants in Paris. It also came in the wake of the destruction of the Calais Jungle which saw refugees transported around the country. It is not yet known what caused the fight in Paris. There had already been scuffles on Monday as mainly Afghans and Eritreans tried to save their possessions during the raid, which started soon after 8am. It followed thousands of Muslim freeloaders arriving in the French capital following the razing of the Calais Jungle refugee camp last week. While some 5000 Jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around France, many others headed off independently, saying they still wanted to get to Britain. Up to 3000 set up tents on the pavements around the Stalingrad Metro station, which is close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub in the north of Paris. Shortly before Monday’s clearance French president Francois Hollande said: ‘We won’t tolerate the camps any longer.’ Referring to the Paris clearance, Mr Hollande said: ‘We are going to carry out the same operation as in Calais.’ CRS riot police around Stalingrad said there would be a ‘gradual operation’ which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone.",0
21091,PressTV-Scotland warns of Brexit implications,"Foreign Policy Scotland's Secretary of State David Mundell (Photo by AFP) 
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell has warned about the consequences of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU), saying Brexit would cut access to the single market. 
Mundell told members of the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that neither Scotland nor any other part of the UK was going to get a “special deal” during the negotiations with the EU. 
""So there are very specific issues to specific industries, but there won't be special deals and it's absolutely wrong to characterize a suggestion that certain areas of the country will get a special deal and Scotland will not,” he said. 
“I accept on one level, if we are leaving the EU then essentially we are leaving the single market but access to the single market can, I think, continue in a way that doesn't involve tariffs or barriers,” the secretary continued. 
British and Scottish officials have long been engaged in a war of words over the Brexit process, with Scotland asking for an “equal” role in the negotiations. 
During an EU referendum on June 23, Scotland voted 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the 28-member bloc, but Britons voted to leave, 52 percent to 48 percent. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May has made it clear that she will complete the Brexit process by 2019 and that Scotland holds no veto over it. 
Scotland, in response, has threatened to secede from the UK in order to preserve its EU membership, which in turn guarantees the nation’s access to the EU single market. 
Last year, Scotland’s first attempt for independence from the UK was blocked by voters in a referendum. 
Mundell told MSPs that the possibility of a second referendum was already harming Scottish businesses, even more than Brexit. 
“It is already evident, because I understand that the surveyors organization have said there is a drop off in the take up of commercial property in Scotland,” he said. 
Experts warn that in case of a hard Brexit, the UK may lose its preferential access to the EU's single market and suffer from soured relations with other EU members. Loading ... ",0

Об этом говорится в распространенном в четверг документе с фактами выполнения РФ своих обязательств по договоренностям с США по Сирии и их нарушений Вашингтоном. 0 комментариев 0 поделились Разрушенный Алеппо. Фото: AP 
С текстом этого документа можно ознакомиться на сайте Министерства обороны России. Как ожидается, он будет внесен на рассмотрение в СБ ООН в Нью-Йорке в ближайшее время. 
В документе, в частности, указывается, что США не осуществляли в Сирии борьбу с признанной СБ ООН террористической группировкой ""Джебхат ан-Нусра"" и не предоставляли РФ полной информации о расположении боевиков этой группировки в САР, что затрудняло их отделение от представителей умеренной оппозиции. 
Вместо взятых на себя обязательств по организации гуманитарного доступа в г. Алеппо, США допустили заминирование силами оппозиции все подступы к Алеппо, а лидеры оппозиционных групп отказались пропустить гуманитарные конвои ООН. 
Из-за вполне определенных указаний из Вашингтона американские специалисты, прибывшие в Сирию для создания совместного исполнительного центра (СИЦ) России и США, целью которого является планирование совместных ударов по объектам «Джабхат ан-Нусры» и ИГИЛ, так и не приступили к работе. 
Также Вашингтон предоставил список из 138 умеренных оппозиционных групп, при этом две из них оказались принадлежащими к террористической группировке ИГ*, а 8 - к ""Джебхат ан-Нусре""*.

21096,It Took Less Than 12 Hours For Eric Trump To Break The Law On Election Day,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Well, that sure didn’t take long. Only 12 hours into Election Day and Eric Trump has already broken the law. 
The Trump family isn’t known for their ability to follow the law. Eric Trump apparently decided to start off his day by voting for his narcissistic dad and then breaking the law by posting a picture of his completed ballot on Twitter. Image via Buzzfeed 
This just happens to violate New York election law. Oops. But hey, it’s not like this has been a law for a long time right? Only 126 years. The law stipulates that any person who “[s]hows his ballot after it is prepared for voting, to any person so as to reveal the contents … is guilty of a misdemeanor.” 
Eric Trump was quickly notified that his tweet, featuring a pic of his ballot, was illegal. Image via Buzzfeed 
The law was recently challenged by a group of voters who asked a federal judge to issue an injunction that would allow voters to take ballot selfies. The judge denied their request, ruling on Nov. 3 that, “The public’s interest in orderly elections outweighs the plaintiffs’ interest in taking and posting ballot selfies.” 
According to the judge, the posting of ballot selfies would slow down the voting process, causing unnecessary delays, and threaten the guarantee of “election integrity.” 
Eric Trump eventually removed his tweet, but thanks to screenshots, it hasn’t actually gone away. I have to ask at this point, can’t these people get anything right? Seriously, they managed to screw up voting? By breaking the law? With Twitter ? Of course, they did.

21097,Obama: ‘We Cannot Deny the Legacy of Racism’ in Justice System - Breitbart,"President Barack Obama is finishing his term with a lengthy essay on criminal justice reform in the Harvard Law Review, arguing that Americans should recognize systemic racism in the system. [“[W]e cannot deny the legacy of racism that continues to drive inequality in how the justice system is experienced by so many Americans,” Obama wrote in his 56 page essay.  Obama cited studies from the NAACP showing that   and Hispanics were more likely to be stopped by law enforcement officials and suffer stricter penalties in court. “If we are to chart honestly the path for criminal justice reform, we must confront the role of race and bias in shaping the policies that led us to this point,” Obama wrote. Obama defended his decision to free 1, 324 prisoners during his presidency, either through pardons or clemency. “While not a substitute for the lasting change that can be achieved by passage of legislation, the clemency power represents an important and underutilized tool for advancing reform,” Obama explained.

21100,"Vincent Viola, Nominee for Army Secretary, Drops Out - The New York Times","Vincent Viola, a billionaire Wall Street trader and President Trump’s nominee for secretary of the Army, abruptly withdrew his name for the post on Friday night after concluding it would be too difficult to untangle himself from his business ties, two government officials said. Mr. Viola is an owner of the Florida Panthers hockey club and a majority shareholder in Virtu Financial and Eastern Air Lines, among a number of other business interests. This week The New York Times reported that Mr. Viola had been negotiating to swap his stake in Eastern Air Lines for a stake in Swift Air, an airline with government subcontracts. If his nomination had continued, he would have faced certain scrutiny for potentially becoming a government official who benefits from federal contracts. The Trump administration did not announce his withdrawal, which was reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News, but a senior administration official and a Pentagon official separately confirmed his decision, which the White House accepted Friday. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Viola is a 1977 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and he last served in the Army Reserves at the rank of major. He remained connected to the military through donations to West Point, including to the academy’s Combating Terrorism Center. A former Pentagon official and close friend said Mr. Viola was devastated over having to withdraw from what he described as a lifelong dream job. But the former official said Mr. Viola felt he was unable to sell his interest in some of his holdings because doing so could have destroyed those companies. His decision followed weeks of negotiations between his lawyers and the government as they sought to find a solution. Ultimately, they could not. Mr. Viola has a net worth of almost $1. 8 billion and is a   of Virtu. Virtu had planned to go public in 2014, but pulled the plug on the move because of choppy markets and lingering questions around how   trading firms like Virtu make money. In a regulatory filing at the time, Virtu said regulators were looking into its trading practices. It is not known if this issue played a role in Mr. Viola’s decision to withdraw his name for the Army secretary job, which is a post that requires Senate confirmation. His decision to withdraw comes the same week another of Mr. Trump’s appointees, Anthony Scaramucci, was told he would not get a top job at the White House amid concerns about the recent sale of his company to a large Chinese conglomerate. In an episode unrelated to the finances of Mr. Viola, it was recently revealed that he was involved in an altercation in August: He was accused of punching a concessions worker at a racehorse auction in Saratoga Springs, N. Y. No charges were brought against him. Mr. Viola was one of the first nominations Mr. Trump issued the day he was inaugurated. “Vincent Viola, everybody likes Vincent,” Mr. Trump said just hours after his   as he signed orders nominating his cabinet.",0

There have been various insider reports on the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary email scandal on FOX. 
But the curious thing about this Wall Street Journal report is that it's clearly aimed at defending Hillary Clinton and smearing the FBI in the battle with Obama's DOJ officials who wanted to shut it down due to their support of Hillary Clinton. 
Which means that its information that damns its own side gains more credibility. 
Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. 
Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to “stand down,’’ a person familiar with the matter said. 
A stand down order. Much like the one in Libya. 
And remember McCabe, whose wife's Democratic political campaign received major cash from a Clinton ally? 
Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI’s No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation. 
Not a surprise either. 
The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn’t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out. 
FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. 
As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn’t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. 
And that's what blew up when Team Hillary lashed out at the FBI. It was a covert war between Hillary's DOJ allies and the FBI coming out of the cold. And they pushed so hard even McCabe was disgusted. 
As a result of those complaints, these people said, a senior Justice Department official called the FBI deputy director, Mr. McCabe, on Aug. 12 to say the agents in New York seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions, these people said. The conversation was a tense one, they said, and at one point Mr. McCabe asked, “Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?’’ The senior Justice Department official replied: ”Of course not.”

21107,Southern Poverty Law Center Names Florida-Based Now The End Begins As ‘Active Anti Government Group’,"  Southern Poverty Law Center Names Florida-Based Now The End Begins As ‘Active Anti Government Group’ ""That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."" - Declaration of Independence   We are not against government , we are against bad government, oppressiv e government, corrupt government and anti-American government. 
“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:” Romans 13:1-3 (KJV) 
This is what the Southern Poverty Law Center says about themselves on thier own website: “The SPLC is the premier U.S. non-profit organization monitoring the activities of domestic hate groups and other extremists – including the Ku Klux Klan , the neo-Nazi movement, neo-Confederates , racist skinheads , black separatists , antigovernment militias , Christian Identity adherents and others.” 
So it was with great amusement that I saw on page 60 of their yearly “ The Year In Hate And Extremism ” where they provide a state-by-state listing of anti government groups, Now The End Begins was included in their assessment of Florida. Hmmm…is NTEB really an “anti government” group? 
No, we are not. My father was a vet of both WWII and Korea, my brother a US Marine, and I have lots of friends who are warfighters, police officers and first responders. I was raised to have a deep and abiding respect for the police and government officials. I have never advocated for any uprising against our government, and certainly never advocated for violence on any level. That being said, NTEB is in 100% agreement with the following statement by founding father Thomas Jefferson: 
“That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.” – Declaration of Independence 
NTEB has been very hard on the Obama administration for reasons listed here , here and here . As well as here , here and here . And here . And oh, here , here and here , too. Ugh, enough already! A short Compilation of Barack Obama’s blatant lies: 
Now The End Begins is not “against government” , but we are against bad government, oppressiv e government, corrupt government and anti-American government. The Obama administration has been an 8 year experiment in white guilt, unvetted illegal immigration and a doubling of the National Debt just to name a few. Barack Obama is the anti-Reagan, a global citizen and the “ president of the world .” That’s not good government for America, that’s slop created for Socialists, Liberals and Communists by true anti-government troublemakers like Saul Alinsky . That’s not us, not by a long shot. Donald Trump: “My policy is America first” 
In 2016, America is presented with a fantastic opportunity to elect as leader, not a politician, but a businessman whose platform is simple. Put America first , and work to restore our former greatness. Wow, that’s exactly right. That’s a government that I can wholeheartedly support. That’s a government that the founding fathers would support. 
It’s time to Make America Great Again.

21110,Spring Weather? Snowstorm? New York Schools to Close on Thursday - The New York Times,"The   weather in New York City saw a   62 degrees on Wednesday, but a significant snowstorm expected to move in overnight prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio to close schools on Thursday. The announcement came after the National Weather Service on Wednesday posted a winter storm warning for the city and a blizzard warning for the eastern part of Long Island. Forecasts called for 8 to 12 inches of snow throughout northern New Jersey, the Hudson Valley, Long Island, coastal Connecticut and the city. The heaviest snow was expected from early Thursday morning through afternoon, with wind gusts up to 35 m. p. h. the service said on its website. Nationwide, airports were reporting more than 2, 800 canceled flights for Thursday, according to FlightAware. com, a   website. Newark Liberty International Airport had 603 canceled flights, La Guardia Airport, 566, and Kennedy International Airport, 480, the website reported on Thursday night. On Wednesday, the temperature reached 62 degrees in Central Park, beating the previous record of 61 degrees set in 1965. Around the city on Wednesday, people were taking advantage  —   walking around in   and tank tops, sitting outdoors at cafes, enjoying parks and promenades. For children who longed for a snow day, the news of the snowstorm was a reason to cheer. Libby Courtemanche had taken her two sons, Christopher, 2, and Bradley, less than a year old, to a park in Huntington, Long Island, on Wednesday. “You know what’s gonna happen tomorrow?” she asked the   . “It’s gonna snow. And we’re gonna get to play in the snow. ” And this roller coaster ride of extremes is sure to provide fuel for those who gripe about the weather. It will be unseasonably warm Wednesday and unpleasantly wintry Thursday, but neither will be just right, of course. Tim Morrin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the drastic shift in weather was “unusual, but it’s certainly not unprecedented. ” The extremes should not be seen as a sign that the gods are angry. Mr. Morrin said it could be explained by two competing weather patterns: cold air masses descending from the North that will push out a   warm air mass in time to chill the city and turn precipitation to snow. “Air masses move,” he said. “It’s just the timing. ” At Cozy Coffee in   Brooklyn, patrons headed straight for the back patio, where owner Migdalia Medina ran cups of coffee and small plates of food plates to people seated at picnic tables under a canopy of bare tree branches. “As soon as they feel it they start coming out,” Ms. Medina said of her customers. As for Thursday’s forecast, she said the patio seating “also looks good under snow. ” The New York weather historian Steve Fybish, who keeps records of the city’s weather dating to the 19th century, agreed that the weather swing was not unusual. He rifled through his records to find other days of similar extremes: a snowstorm and a   afternoon within a couple of days in 1984 69 degrees on a November day followed by five inches of snow in 1896. In February 2014, when the Super Bowl was at the Meadowlands, in East Rutherford, N. J. the weather swung sharply. While there had been concerns that the outdoor game at MetLife Stadium would be affected by the cold, game day registered a mild 49 degrees at the stadium and 57 degrees in the city. But the next day, the temperature plunged to 27 degrees followed by a cold snap that was punctuated by eight inches of snow. On Thursday, the snowfall is likely to be heaviest during the morning commute, Mr. Morrin said. “I don’t think there’s going to be anyone rushing anywhere,” he said. “The commute time will be impacted. ”",0
21112,Ivana Says Young Donald Trump Was A Cry-Baby – Has Anything Changed? (VIDEO),"Ivana Says Young Donald Trump Was A Cry-Baby – Has Anything Changed? (VIDEO) By Carrie MacDonald on October 27, 2016 Subscribe 
Ivana Trump, the first wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, confirmed what many of us have been thinking for a long time now: Trump is a childish buffoon. Her story of a young Donald Trump on the ski slopes is telling of the temperament we see in the nominee now. Ivana Trump: ‘He Could Not Take It’ 
Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio spoke with Ivana Trump about her marriage to The Donald, and she remembered a time he took her skiing. This was early on, before they married, and one would think Donald would want to show his best side, right? 
No. 
You see, Ivana neglected to tell the young Donald Trump that she was a very accomplished skier. According to Ivana Trump, Donald skied down the slope first, and then: “… He goes and stops, and he says, ‘Come on, baby. Come on, baby.’ I went up. I went two flips up in the air, two flips in front of him. I disappeared. Donald was so angry, he took off his skis, his ski boots, and walked up to the restaurant. He could not take it. He could not take it.” 
She said he stormed off, saying: “I’m not going to do this for anybody, including Ivana.” 
We all know by now that Donald Trump is a man who doesn’t like to lose. Ever. He is a man easily baited, easily goaded, and he has the temper of a petulant child. His outbursts have sparked the hashtag #trumpertantrum . 
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was correct when she said, in her speech at the Democratic National Convention: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” 
Nor is a man who storms off in a huff when bested by his girlfriend on the ski slopes. Donald Trump: ‘I Loved To Fight’ 
D’Antonio also said that Donald told him how he loved a good fight. “I loved to fight. I always loved to fight. All types of fights. Any kind of fight, I loved it, including physical.” 
There’s a word for people who act like that: Bully. 
Of course, Trump has put his childish, bullying ways on display for the world during this election cycle. Ivana just happened to be one of his earlier victims. 
Watch their appearance on Oprah in 1988, when Trump said she does what he tells her to do:

21114,White House: FBI Leaks ‘One of Many’ Reasons Why James Comey Was Fired - Breitbart,"White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said that FBI Director James Comey’s inability to control leaks out of the bureau was “one of many” reasons why President Donald Trump decided to fire him.  “I think that’s probably one of the many factors,” Sanders said in response to a question from Breitbart News during the White House press briefing. “I mean you can’t deny somebody that that wasn’t a problem, and so I think that was just another one of many reasons that he no longer had the confidence of the president or the rest of the FBI. ” Trump has repeatedly called attention to FBI leaks to the media about the investigation into his campaign for any collusion with Russia in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. Sanders said that director Comey had “essentially taken a stick of dynamite” to the Justice Department after commenting publicly on the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email investigation. When asked if the president was prepared to fire more officials from the Justice Department, Sanders replied, “Not that I’m aware of today. ” Sanders described a gradual “erosion of trust” surrounding Comey since Trump was inaugurated, and that the president wanted to give him a chance despite the reservations he had about the director. She asserted that it was not true that Trump asked the Justice Department to put together a rationale for Comey’s firing. “I did speak directly to the president and heard directly from him that he, again, had been considering letting Director Comey go pretty much since the day he took office, but that there was no request by him to have a review at the Department of Justice,” she said. She said she was “surprised” by Democrats rushing to defend Comey, despite their insistence that he directly contributed to Hillary Clinton’s failure to win the presidency. “If Hillary Clinton had won the election, which thank God she didn’t, but if she had and she had been in the same position, she had have fired Comey immediately and the very Democrats that are criticizing the president today would be dancing in the streets celebrating. ”",0
21115,Saudi commits crimes on global scale with US green light: Houthi,"Yemen This still shows Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement, delivering a televised speech. (file photo) 
The leader of Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement says Saudi Arabia commits crimes across the globe with the US green light. 
Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said on Wednesday that the Al Saud family has adopted a hypocritical approach in the Muslim world, the proof of which is Takfiri violence gripping the region. 
""When Washington gives the Riyadh regime the green light, sedition sparks in all countries, with the Saudi offensive being in line with such a trend,"" he added. 
The Houthi leader also warned that Saudi Arabia is seeking to damage security in some Arab countries such as Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Iraq through petrodollars and deceptive propaganda works. 
Instead of countering the enemies of Islam, including the US and Israel, the kingdom has been engaged in spreading Takfiri ideology and arming terrorists, Houthi noted. 
'Saudi has Yemenis’ blood on its hands' 
On October 8, in one of the deadliest attacks Yemen, Saudi warplanes bombarded a funeral hall packed with mourners in Sana’a, killing over 140 people and injuring at least 525 others. 
Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights group, said that the Sana’a bombing constitutes an apparent war crime, while Amnesty International said the attack was a reminder of the need for the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. People inspect the aftermath of a Saudi airstrike in Sana’a, Yemen, October 8, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
Saudi Arabia committed crimes by the Sana’a attack, but it tried to acquit itself of the assault, Houthi said, adding that there was no clear sign suggesting an end to the Saudi offensive. 
He also stressed that Yemenis cannot rely on the United Nations as the world body has not adopted a position regarding the Saudi attack in Sana’a. 
Houthi further wished victory for the Palestinian nation and the resistance front in Lebanon and Syria as well as the Iraqi people in their anti-terror operation in the city of Mosul. 
The Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a three-day truce in the conflict-ridden country expired. 
Yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. 
The offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government. The US has been providing logistic and surveillance support to the kingdom in the bloody military campaign. Loading ...",0

Michael Moore was super excited to learn that Republicans were driving traffic to his film , “Trumpland,” by passing around on social media a four-minute clip, even though he claims it was doctored. That’s not cool — if anyone’s going to doctor the footage in a Michael Moore movie, its going to be Michael Moore. 
Obviously Moore’s not a Donald Trump fan, and like many other liberals this weekend, he’s not an Anthony Weiner fan. Setting aside Judicial Watch’s lawsuit against the State Department, Hillary Clinton almost looked to be in the clear a few months back, but now her email shenanigans have returned to the front pages, all because of Weiner’s compulsion to send vulgar selfies online. Unbelievable that once again Hillary has to suffer the abuse of men & their dickish behavior. Bubba, Weiner, Trump, Newt, Comey. Sick of it.

What did Bill Clinton do that was so wrong? Hillary long ago established that he was the victim of a vast right-wing conspiracy. And Weiner? Sure, be angry at him for the way he’s treated his wife and the women he’s sexted, but there would be no sensitive emails on his laptop if Hillary and company had simply used the secure government email accounts provided to them. 
Moore was just getting started on his misandrist rant, and when he’s on a roll, it’s best to step away until he’s finished it. The day can't come soon enough when women will take charge. Public policy will not be decided by dick pix, Tic Tacs, grab-assers or the GOP.

Crumlin Road Gaol fue inaugurada en 1845, y hasta su cierre en 1996 se llevaron a cabo decenas de ejecuciones. Desde que la prisión fue cerrada se ha registrado una serie de avistamientos paranormales, en particular en la cámara de esperas de ejecuciones y en la propia cámara de la muerte.

21131,French Socialists Collapsing Just Weeks Before Election,"PARIS (AFP)  —   France’s governing Socialist party was in tatters Thursday after former prime minister Manuel Valls spurned the party’s official presidential candidate and backed independent centrist Emmanuel Macron. [Valls’ endorsement of Macron seals the rift between what the former premier has described as “two irreconcilable lefts”  —   one still wedded to the class struggle, represented by presidential nominee Benoit Hamon, and another reformist camp led by Valls.  Successive Socialist leaders managed to hold the party together but under President Francois Hollande the tacit   pact between the two factions broke down, leaving the party in disarray. Le Parisien newspaper said Valls’ repudiation of Hamon  —   a leftist rebel who quit the government in 2014 over its   policies  —   was the “nail in the coffin” of the party. The party of Francois Mitterrand that had acted as a broad church of the left since the 1970s “died yesterday, without panache, corroded by ideological and personal rivalries,” the paper wrote. Valls’ nod comes less than a month before the first round of the election on April 23, with polls showing Macron and   leader Marine Le Pen running   . Hamon is trailing in fifth place, behind conservative candidate Francois Fillon and   radical   Melenchon. The Socialist candidate had always been expected to struggle after five years of lacklustre rule under the unpopular Hollande. Valls said his decision to back Macron, who quit the Socialist government last year to form his own movement, En Marche (On the Move)  —   styled as neither of the left nor right  —   was “not a matter of the heart but of reason”. “I think you should not take any risks for the Republic” Valls said, saying he did the “responsible” thing in opting for the candidate tipped to easily beat Le Pen in May’s election  . But for many on the left the endorsement smacked of treachery after Valls pledged to back the winner of the Socialist primary in January, in which he was the  . A furious Hamon on Wednesday urged voters to reject those who “stabbed (me) in the back”. A Socialist activist in Marseille lodged a criminal complaint against Valls for “breach of trust” saying his disavowal of Hamon was “the straw that broke the camel’s back. ” “He (Valls) lost” in the primary,” Sylvie   told AFP, calling on Valls to quit the party. “It was up to him to bridge the gap” with Hamon.  —   Bedfellows no more  —   For Henry Rey, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris, there are not two but three lefts in France: a liberal camp represented by Valls and Macron, a   camp led by Hamon and a radical camp led by Melenchon  —   who is now the leading presidential contender on the left. On Wednesday, a bullish Melenchon rebuffed a desperate appeal by Hamon for the two to join forces. “It’s clear that trying to make the various lefts cohabit no longer works, as demonstrated by the disastrous end to Hollande’s presidency,” Rey said. “The lines are being redrawn, which is a precondition for the recomposition of the left,” he said. The lines are also shifting on the right, with Macron and the nationalist Le Pen draining support from the   Fillon. “It feels as if all the old political forces are dying before our very eyes,” political analyst Pascal Perrineau said. Thibaut Rioufreyt, a researcher at Sciences Po university in Lyon, warned however against writing the obituary for the Socialist Party (PS). “The PS has become a federation of local politicians,” he wrote in La Croix newspaper. “It will still exist but its positioning will change. ”",0

Andrew Cuomo has hired two fundraisers from Florida, a sign he may be working toward a presidential bid, the New York Post reported. [One of the consultants he hired is former Hillary Clinton fundraiser Jon Adrabi, who “will help plan events and build relationships with Democratic donors in the key swing state. ”  “Hiring    fundraising staff, particularly in a battleground state, opens up money spigots beyond what would normally be available and is a key first step to laying the groundwork for a run,” a Democratic operative told the Post. The source says that Cuomo wants to “hire political consultants with experience outside of New York. ” Cuomo is planning several fundraisers next month to add to the $22 million he already has. One of those events includes “a dinner at the St. Regis where tickets cost $15, 000 per person,” and “sources say a South Florida event is also in the works. ” Cuomo has become very vocal about issues in the Trump administration, further “expanding his national profile. ” He announced a plan to fight antisemitism and hate crimes, spoke out against Trump’s executive order on immigration, and vowed to protect transgender students in New York after the Trump administration repealed guidelines allowing students to use the bathroom of their preferred gender identity.",0

[Arthur, directed by Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes, Snatch) and starring Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law, reportedly cost Warner Bros. and production partner Village Roadshow $175 million to produce, according to the Hollywood Reporter. That number doesn’t count the studio’s marketing spend, which likely puts the final figure closer to $200 million.  But Arthur is reportedly tracking to earn in the $25 million range when it premieres on more than 3, 600 screens on May 12. That won’t be nearly enough to knock Guardians from the top spot. The James   superhero sequel starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista and Bradley Cooper is projected to remain number one this weekend with a $60 million second frame, which would add to its already hefty global gross of $494 million. King Arthur  —   which currently sits at a dismal 22 percent on ratings aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes  —   will need to make up ground overseas if it is to turn a profit for Warners and Village Roadshow. Meanwhile, the box office likely won’t get much help from the weekend’s other   newcomer, the Amy   Hawn   kidnap caper Snatched. Snatched is projected to debut in the   millions range for Fox and Chernin Entertainment. The Jonathan   comedy  —   which reportedly cost $42 million to produce  —   hopes to benefit from a Mother’s Day weekend release and the return of Hawn after a   absence from the big screen, but early reviews of the film have been highly negative, with critics singling out Hawn’s underwhelming performance and the film’s subtly racist undertones. Also opening this weekend is   Attractions’ Iraq War psychological thriller The Wall, directed by Doug Liman and starring Aaron   and John Cena,   comedy Absolutely Anything with Simon Pegg and the Monty Python crew, and the indie drama Lowriders starring Melissa Beniost and Eva Longoria.

21141,Physicians on Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0: ‘Doomed for Failure’ - Breitbart,"Physicians urging     health care say House Speaker Paul Ryan’s newly released proposal to repeal Obamacare does not actually repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and, therefore, is “doomed for failure. ”[“Since this does not completely repeal the ACA, we are still left with thousands of pages of regulations that will have unknown consequences in the future,” Dr. Gerard Gianoli, of the   Ear and Balance Institute, tells Breitbart News. “The GOP plan is worse than a repeal with no replacement plan at all. ”  Gianoli explains: It will not prevent the death spiral of the insurance industry, which will be now blamed on Republicans, and the march toward a     system will continue. The GOP plan is doomed for failure. Instead of returning the insurance market to the vigor of a free market, the government will be supporting it with tax credits  —   the flip side of the ACA insurance penalty. Gianoli says the difference between Obama’s health insurance plan and Ryan’s proposal amounts to semantics: The difference is considering whether the bottle is half full or half empty. In other words, there really isn’t any difference. Further, the stipulation of preventing the insurance industry from   premiums from initial policy inception will lead to continued gaming of the system that will not be adequately adjusted by the “30% penalty” for interrupted coverage. Hopefully, this plan will not be passed. Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, also observes to Breitbart News that the new proposal  —   kept secret by Ryan until its release  —   “is 57 pages with a number of ‘repeal this’ and ‘repeal that’ clauses, but no ‘repeal ACA. ’” “So to paraphrase Nancy Pelosi, what is still in it?” Orient asks. “Was that the subject of secret meetings with special interests?” Orient continues: “Refundable” tax credits  —   for those who don’t owe taxes  —   are still a subsidy. It is still redistribution of wealth, with winners (those who get the subsidy) and losers (those who pay for it). And the chief winner is the “health plan. ” It gets money the supposed beneficiary may get nothing, or only rationed care from a narrow network. “The problem is comprehensive   payment,” Orient adds. “The bill perpetuates this disastrous concept. A true   bill  —   “there shall be a free market in health insurance”  —   would remove all federal mandates, subsidies, barriers to competition, or protections or advantages for cartels. ” Conservatives such as former House Freedom Caucus chairman Jim Jordan and Virginia Rep. Dave Brat also object to Ryan’s proposed Obamacare repeal plan, asserting it is still Obamacare in a different form. “The bill maintains many of the federal features including a new entitlement program as well as most of the insurance regulations,” Brat said. “Now [they] are saying we’re going to do repeal and replace but the bill does nothing of the sort. [Speaker] Paul Ryan has always said the entire rationale for this bill is to bend the cost curve down, and so far I have seen no evidence that this bill will bring the cost curve down. ”",0
21142,Hillary and the Ghosts of Watergate,"| Charles Hugh Smith | Of Two Minds | 286 views 
If there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of Watergate, it is that the big-money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds. 
The parallels between Hillary Clinton and Richard Nixon are not legal–they are political: specifically, how can a leader crippled by scandal and cover-ups govern? 
In even blunter terms: how can a crippled politico deliver the goods to the special interests who bet their cash and political capital on the politico’s ability to deliver favors? 
Among the many ghosts of Watergate, one specter especially haunts Hillary: once the special interests and party stalwarts who defended you through every scandal and every cover-up–month after month and year after year, on the promise that you would deliver the goods upon ascending to the presidency–realize you are too damaged to deliver anything of value to anyone, why would they continue supporting you? 
Once a politico has to declare “I am not a crook” based on legalese rather than a moral foundation, that politico’s ability to lead has vanished. Hillary and her supporters rely entirely on legalese parsing of wrong-doing rather than on a self-explanatory, basic moral foundation of right and wrong. 
Declaring “I am not a crook” because the wrongdoing escapes prosecution is the same as declaring “I am above the law.” If the foundation of one’s ability to lead is a reliance on legal parsing and allies in the Department of Justice squashing investigations while handing out immunity like candy on Halloween, the political capital required to lead no longer exists. 
Ultimately, the President leads by moral suasion. Even the political act of delivering the goods to the special interests that funded your campaign and your wealth must be backed by the moral authority of personal integrity and a morally grounded appeal to the common good. 
A politician who has effectively zero personal integrity is only as viable as his/her ability to deliver favors to the few (i.e. special interests) over the objections of the many. A reliance on cold-blooded horse-trading only works if the leader has enough political capital to arm-twist everyone into granting favors to allies and special interests. 
But this political capital rests on moral suasion and support earned not by issuing promises but by leading the nation through thorny thickets to solutions that work for the many, not just the few. 
Once the ability to lead has been lost, special interests can forget about getting favors. And once they realize their politico is a liability rather than an asset, self-preservation requires abandoning the liability as quickly as possible. 
It’s nothing personal, it’s just business. Anyone who thinks Hillary has the personal integrity to build sufficient political capital to lead is delusional. Anyone who believes Hillary has the moral foundation to deliver the goods to the myriad special interests that have funded her campaign and her personal wealth is equally delusional. 
Are Goldman Sachs et al. delusional? If there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of Watergate, it is that the big-money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds.",0

When one of Leonards friends told him about the Trumphole victory he had a heart attack and dropped dead on the spot. 
It was well known he was ill and had to go back on the road after his manager ripped him off, but it seems the rise of Neo-Nazism in the US was the final straw for his saddened heart. He had not long completed his final album written about the US election called 'You want it darker' which now will become historically famous as a work of astonishing prescience. 
He is best remembered for his magnificent song Hallelujah and his 60's 'tell it like it is sister' lyrics which inspired people to understand the voices in their own heart and not to project hatred upon others. 
Who could ever forget KD Lang singing that song at the Montreal Olympics, it was the highlight of the games. 
RIP to a great man, may his message that is needed ever more now resonate in the hearts of all, especially those that see pubescent hatred as a valid way of relating to the world.

21155,Tim Kaine: Clinton Email Announcement “Very Troubling” 11 Days Before Election,"Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine reveals that he thinks it’s “very troubling” that the FBI told the press that they are taking a look at some recently released Clinton emails to determine relevancy to her case. 
Kaine believes that to do so this close to the election is inappropriate. 
Breitbart reports: 
During a portion of an interview set to air on Friday’s “VICE News Tonight” on HBO Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) reacted to the FBI’s announcement that it is taking another look at his running mate Hillary Clinton’s emails by saying that doing this 11 days before the election without “many details, but details are apparently being given by the FBI to the press, this is very, very troubling.” 
Kaine said, “When you do this 11 days before a presidential election, and you don’t provide many details, but details are apparently being given by the FBI to the press, this is very, very troubling, and we hope that the director, and we really think that he should, give a clearer accounting of exactly what’s going on.” 
So the FBI should have kept it a secret until after the election, if you want Kaine’s opinion. Sounds EXACTLY like the type of guy we want one breath from the presidency, right? 
And what exactly does Kaine mean by saying that the FBI “isn’t providing many details, but details are apparently being given”? 
This may sound inappropriate to Kaine, because anything that isn’t positive about Clinton is inappropriate. 
Of course, it would be another matter altogether if this was about Trump.",0
21156,Half Of Russians Fear Syria Could Spark WW3,"Half Of Russians Fear Syria Could Spark WW3 11/02/2016 
RUSSIA TODAY Almost half of all respondents in a recent Russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between Russia and the West caused by the ongoing crisis in Syria could develop into a global military conflict. 
The share of those who see the probability of World War Three in the near future as high or very high is now at 48 percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise 42 percent of society, the privately-owned public opinion research center Levada reported on Monday. The remaining 10 percent of respondents said they couldn’t give a simple answer to the question. 
When researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that Russia and the West would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis, 35 percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely. Thirty-nine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and 26 percent said that they couldn’t answer the question. 
Just over half – 52 percent – of Russians said they approve of their country’s involvement in the Syrian conflict and 26 percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this. Just under a quarter – 23 percent – couldn’t answer the question about their personal view on the subject. Those who thought that Russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided 49 percent against 28 percent respectively, with 24 percent finding the question too difficult to answer. 
The level of awareness about the situation in Syria and the Russian Air Force operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists there remained fairly high. Eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in Syria and 64 percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue. Just under a fifth – 17 percent – said that they were not interested in news about Syria. 
A similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent Levada Center showed that over 70 percent of Russian citizens supported the air operations against IS terrorists in Syria, and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for Russia to support the government of Syria’s democratically-elected President Bashar Assad. 
A different poll conducted earlier this month by the state-run research center VTSIOM showed that 73 percent of Russians believed that Western criticism of the air force’s counter-terrorism operation in Aleppo, Syria, was ungrounded and prejudiced. Only 6 percent said the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Russian military have some basis in reality. 
Russia first deployed an air force contingent in Syria in 2015, after receiving a request for military help from the Syrian government, which is currently battling Islamic State and affiliated groups. Russian war planes began launching airstrikes on terrorists in Syria on September 30, 2015. Their work has aided the Syrian military in achieving considerable success in driving jihadist forces out of the country.",0

21162,(((Smithsonian))) Refuses to Include Judge in Black Museum Because He has Normal People Opinions,"(((Smithsonian))) Refuses to Include Judge in Black Museum Because He has Normal People Opinions 
Eric Striker October 27, 2016 Dat nigga ain’t even smoke crack. 
The Smithsonian Museum, run by American Jewish Committee award-winning mankind harasser (((David J. Skorton))), has decided to exclude Supreme Court Justice Judge Clarence Thomas from its African-American Museum, showing that Jews only want to empower certain kinds of blacks that advance Jew-specific agendas. This Jew gets to decide who gets into the black museum and who doesn’t. 
While I don’t agree with Thomas’ conservative philosophy, he has long been a constitution-respecting thorn in the side of the Jewish activist judge bloc of Ginsburg, Breyer and Kagan. Whenever these Jews (and Sotomayor, along with the Jew Merrick Garland if he gets confirmed) vote to get something insane through, Thomas has been a reliable voice of reason tempering and often downvoting them in defense of free speech, freedom of association, etc. 
Coming from a background of poverty and homelessness, Thomas has genuinely worked hard and shown remarkable aptitude in the art of jurisprudence, he wasn’t appointed to fill an Affirmative Action quota. He is a member of the “talented tenth” of the black race and if there’s going to be an African-American museum, he has certainly earned his place in it, yet won’t be included , because he has refused to abuse his gavel in pursuit of violent anti-White discord. Rather than commending him for his legal ethic, Jews are punishing him by obliterating his memory as soon as he dies to serve as an example to any other unusually intelligent blacks out there. 
It’s not a secret that Jews filter just who and what Negroes in America should aspire to, from founding the pro-race mixing NAACP and sabotaging black nationalist Marcus Garvey, to running virtually all media intended for black people (BET-owned by Sumner Redstone’s Viacom, or The Root Â –Â run by Israeli citizen Haim Saban’s Univision), and now picking and choosing what individuals blacks should exemplary members of their race. 
So who is being included? 
Well, the African-American Museum has an entire section dedicated to the Jewish-financed and extreme anti-white Black Panthers , Black Lives Matter, convicted Cultural Marxist terrorist Angela Davis. Examples of some of the ideological indoctrination featured at this Jewseum. Is (((Gloria Steinem))) “African-American”? So why is she there? 
Cracked out James Brown, famous for shuckin’ and jivin’ while smoking crack and not much else, is according to reports treated by the Smithsonian as the second coming of Christ. 
Is that appropriate? 
I won’t go as far as to claim that blacks would be astrophysicists if all Jews vanished tomorrow, but I will say that blacks would not only be far better off according to every metric, they also would instinctively respect and emulate the White man as Booker T. Washington believed they should, rather than lash out at us for no reason as Jews instruct them to. 
Blacks in the 1930’s once had a crime rate lower than urban Italian and Irish in the law and order South, along with their own small businesses, farms, fairly in-tact families. But because the Jew capitalizes on dysfunctional societies full of dysfunctional people, James Brown is made immortal while they pretend Clarence Thomas ain’t a REAL nigga . 
Jewish cultural mandate socializes some Whites into acting like low-lives as well. While the manifestations are different depending on natural temperament and abilities of race, one thing we can all agree on is that neither the White man nor the black man are living up to their full potential in this age of decline and decay.",0
21164,The FBI's Clinton Investigation Is Wider Than Assumed,"The FBI's Clinton Investigation Is Wider Than Assumed 
The Washington Post editors today added to their hypocrisy with three additional anti-Comey op-eds: Comey’s mistaken quest for transparency 
I interpret that as naked fear that their candidate Hillary Clinton may now loose. That fear is justified. 
The Wall Street Journal today added to its so far excellent reporting on the Clinton issues by revealing the much bigger story behind it: FBI in Internal Feud Over Hillary Clinton Probe - Laptop may contain thousands of messages sent to or from Mrs. Clinton’s private server (open copy here ). 
According to the reporting, based on FBI sources, FBI agents in New York and elsewhere have been looking into the Clinton Foundation for several months. They suspect that this ""charity"" was selling political favors by then Secretary of State Clinton in exchange for donations that personally benefited the Clinton family. 
The Justice Department blocked further aggressive investigations into the issue, allegedly because of the ongoing election. A high FBI official, Andrew McCabe, also showed disinterest in a further pursuit of the issue. McCabe's wife had just tried to get elected as state senator and had receive a campaign donation of nearly $500,000 from Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton friend and at times board member of the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents pursuing the investigation into the Clinton Foundation were not amused. 
The separate investigation into former Congressman Weiner for sexual contacts with minors was looking for pedophile stuff on Weiner's electronic devices. It didn't find any as far as we can tell, but found some 650,000 emails archived on a laptop. Several thousand of these emails were sent or received by Weiner's spouse, the intimate Clinton aide Huma Abedin. They came through Clinton's private email server. At least some of these thousands of emails are likely copies of those that were deleted from Clinton's server when the (separate) investigation into it started. They may be evidence that Clinton sent and received classified documents through her unsecured system. Some of these emails may also contain serious dirt related to the Clinton Foundation. 
Thus we have three ongoing FBI investigations: into Clinton's private email-server used illegally for official State Department business; into the Clinton Foundation and its role in peddling political influence in exchange for donations; into the personal conduct of Anthony Weiner. 
Additional investigations that may come up are on: the mixing of donations to the Clinton Foundation and personal compensation for Bill Clinton for holding highly paid speeches; for profit activities by the group of people running Bill Clinton's businesses as well as the Clinton Foundation financing; inappropriate hindering of the FBI investigations by the Justice Department and/or by McCabe. 
With such a list of potentially very serious scandals pending it is highly understandable that FBI director Comey went public and did not follow the advice from the Justice Department to pursue these issues only on a reduced level. It would have been political suicide to try to keep this silent. Way too many FBI agents eager to pursue these case were in the known and would have talked, as they do now, to the media. 
If Clinton gets elected she will be hampered by these scandals for the next two years. The Republicans in Congress will jump on these issues as soon as possible. There will be endless hearings with large media coverage. The only question is when the first attempts at an impeachment process will be made - before or after she moves back into the White House. She and her family may be better off with her losing the campaign. Posted by b on October 31, 2016 at 03:19 PM | Permalink",0
21166,UN vote calling for end to Cuban embargo adopted with US and Israel abstaining,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:23 UTC © Carlos Barria / Reuters The US government abstained from the UN vote on a resolution calling for an end to the US economic embargo against Cuba, for the first time in 24 years. The 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution with 191 votes in favor on Wednesday. The only other abstention, besides the US, was Israel. The vote is non-binding but it can have political weight. Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez described the abstention as a ""positive step for the future of improving relations between the United States and Cuba,"" according to Reuters. Rodriguez said in September that the embargo cost Cuba $4.6 billion last year, and the full damage over the length of the 50-year embargo was estimated at $125.9 billion. When it was first announced that the US government would abstain from the vote, the entire General Assembly applauded. ""Abstaining on this resolution does not mean that the United States agrees with all of the policies and practices of the Cuban government. We do not,"" Samantha Power the US Ambassador to the United Nations told the General Assembly on Tuesday. ""We are profoundly concerned by the serious human rights violations that the Cuban government continues to commit with impunity against its own people,"" she said, according to AP. The Obama administration began normalizing relations with the Communist-run country in at the end of 2014, easing trade and travel restrictions. On July 20, 2015, diplomatic relations were restored, and embassies in the two countries were reopened. Lifting the full embargo will take the support of the Republican-run Congress, which remains critical of the administration's efforts, arguing it offered too many concessions to Cuba and accepted little in return, especially on human rights and the restoration of expropriated property. Obama made the first visit to Havana by a US president in 88 years in March.",0
21167,Hillary: “We Did Not Lose A Single Important Person In Libya”,"Email 

Hillary Clinton declared during NBC News’s Commander-in-Chief forum that no lives were lost in Libya when she made the move to take out dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Even so, the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that 11 months later four Americans – including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens – were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created. 
“That was one of the few situations in American foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we don’t make the wrong move, and the operation was a success, even Donald Trump supported it,” Clinton argued. “As with any operation of such magnitude, we had a few hiccups, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. As I’ve said, the operation was a success.” 
She continued, “So much so, in fact, that I’m proud to say that no important people were lost through it all, and when I say that, I say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that Libyans could be freed from the iron fist of Gaddafi. It would have been unrealistic to expect 0 casualties; however, the overall toll did not exceed expectations, with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy.” 
“Politics can be a cruel line of work. That being said, I stand before you here, today, and I am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it. And while we’re on the subject of sacrifices, thank God they did not include anyone important from the American delegation, including yours truly,” she said jokingly, causing the auditorium to laugh. 
She said, “But all jokes aside, I have to pay homage to the CIA, who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day. Its agents’ work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come. If it hadn’t been for them, we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations. I am proud that the United States of America has an intelligence agency such as the CIA.” 
“I’m sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay, a bargain, if you will, when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist. I would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed Gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region. For better of worse, we acted and I am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the CIA out of a deal. Because, in the words of a personal friend of mine, who is a former CIA spook – shutting down arms dealers is easy; finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part,” she concluded.",0
21168,Ben Sasse Thinks Biden Would Have Won - The New York Times,"We’re 11 weeks into the Trump administration. What’s the Senate like these days? I think that the institution  —   and I do mean all 535 people, but particularly the hundred in the Senate  —   is filled with really nice and   people. I’ve been there 27 months. But who’s counting? My average duration in a job is more like six months, because I’ve done crisis and turnaround stuff for two decades. I’ve been in a lot of companies and    and institutions that were really on fire in a lot of ways, the Senate is the least urgent, least serious institution I’ve ever worked in. There’s this constant fighting. You should agree on what you’re arguing about before you argue: We are either going to work at our house tonight or we’re going to make dinner together and play music in the living room or we’re going to go out to eat and go to a movie. But the problem is that, at this particular juncture, there’s also a question of whether this hypothetical movie theater even exists. Why are you playing to this outdated, modernist idea that there are objective facts? [Laughs.] What is wrong with you? We do have to agree on some basic facts, despite this general reluctance to grant them legitimacy. Yeah, it’s a huge problem. I sit in the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s seat on the Senate floor. He’s the author of the saying, Everyone’s entitled to their own opinion, but you’re not entitled to your own facts. Look at trade and automation: two competing but slightly overlapping forces in the shrinking of the duration of jobs right now. We have to be able to talk honestly about how disrupted this world is going to be, and it is crazy to mislead people and say we’re going to bring back all of the big factory jobs by creating a protectionist regime. That isn’t true. Do you think that infighting creates a situation in which everyday Americans write off all politicians as cheaters and liars? It might explain how Donald Trump won, because it didn’t make any difference to anybody that he seemed immoral  —   they thought of him as no worse than every other politician. I would argue pretty vociferously that it’s also because of who his opponent was. If Joe Biden would have run against Donald Trump, Biden would have won in a landslide. You have been a constant critic of Trump, even during the primaries. I campaigned with pretty much anybody not named Trump or Huckabee. Including Ted Cruz. Your book, which argues that America’s youths are largely coddled and ill equipped to compete in the global economy, is full of references to ancient history and philosophy. Are you trying to unseat Cruz as the intellectual of the Senate? I don’t see what I’m trying to do as trying to be the intellectual in the Senate. What is it that you’re trying to do? I’m the third or fourth most conservative guy by voting record in the institution, and yet most of the stuff I care about is not really partisan. We have had no foreign policy for the past 28 years for dealing with a   War world. And now you layer on nonstate actors, like jihadis, who have a presence in a quarter to a third of all the countries in the world, and the governments in those countries aren’t the main source of power anymore. But that isn’t anywhere near what keeps the spies and generals up at night, about how cyberattacks will transform war and create all these gray areas that aren’t quite war but are warlike. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine what the obvious    answer looks like, with the divide between the two parties in trying to figure out a   strategy in this new age.",0
21172,UC Berkeley to Offer Class on Fake Language from ’Game of Thrones’,"Students at the University of California Berkeley may not be able to hear conservative commentator Ann Coulter speak on campus  —   however, they can take a   course on a   language used in a popular HBO fantasy show. [The university, already embroiled in a free speech controversy, reportedly plans to offer a   course inspired by the fictional Dothraki and High Valyrian languages used by characters on the HBO series Game of Thrones.   David J. Peterson, who was hired to create the show’s languages, will teach the course titled “The Linguistics of Game of Thrones and the Art of Language Invention. ” Peterson told Berkeley News that the Game of Thrones world created by author George R. R. Martin “will serve as a kind of framing device for the course so students can focus on the linguistic details of their creations, not the fictional side. ” Peterson will teach the     course, which is being offered during the May 22 to June 30 summer session. No stranger to the Hollywood language scene, Peterson has helped develop languages for such shows as the Syfy channel’s Defiance series, Marvel’s Thor, and NBC’s Emerald City. The UC Berkeley fight song “Sons of California” has already been remixed in the Dothraki language.  The Game of Thrones language course announcement comes on the heels of conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s decision to cancel her speech at UC Berkley, after law enforcement sources told Fox News that there was a “99% chance” of violent attacks on campus by   activists if the speech went ahead. The university had initially canceled Coulter’s speech and then rescheduled it for a week later, when the majority of its students did not have class. The two student groups who invited Coulter filed a lawsuit against the school on Monday, alleging its initial cancelation of the event was discriminatory and a violation of First Amendment rights. The seventh season of Game of Thrones returns to HBO on July 16.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson",0
21176,Canada and EU sign ‘thoroughly undemocratic’ CETA trade deal,"Canada and EU sign ‘thoroughly undemocratic’ CETA trade deal Opposition groups note that the deal could still fail legal scrutiny and ratification in Europe By Nadia Prupis 
Canada and the European Union signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on Sunday amid widespread protests against the controversial deal that came back to life after negotiations stalled over objections from Wallonia, Belgium. 
Environmental and democracy groups who opposed the agreement issued cautious statements condemning the signing but noting that CETA was not a done deal. 
“This agreement will probably not survive the democratic and legal scrutiny of the ratification process over the coming months. It’s time for our governments to break rank with corporate lobbyists and redesign a trade policy that respects democracy and promotes the public interest,” said Shira Stanton, trade policy adviser at Greenpeace EU. 
CETA now faces a vote in the European Parliament and ratification by the parliaments of the EU’s 28 countries. 
If it passes, CETA would create a legal system that allows corporations to sue governments for perceived loss of profit. That framework will also be put to scrutiny by the European Court of Justice and the German constitutional court, and if it fails to stand up would invalidate CETA. 
The deal has long been opposed on the grounds that it would harm human rights, democracy, and the climate, among other risks. 
Alfred de Zayas, the United Nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, said in a statement Saturday that each country should hold a referendum on signing the deal before doing so, warning that it was a “corporate-driven, fundamentally flawed treaty.” 
“There is a legitimate fear that CETA will dilute environmental standards, food security, and health and labor protection,” he said. “A treaty that strengthens the position of investors, transnational corporations, and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of states to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats.” 
Global Justice Now (GJN) trade and migration campaigner Guido Tallman tweeted a picture of the massive deal and wrote, “Here’s CETA. Any MEP planning to vote for it, should be sure to read it first. All of it. So they know what they’re voting for.” 
Throughout Europe this weekend, CETA opponents took to the streets to protest the signing. In London on Saturday, many posed outside the European Commission office dressed as zombies to symbolize CETA’s seeming resurrection, urging commissioners to “stop CETA rising from the dead.” 
In Brussels, some protesters broke through a barricade and attempted to storm the European Commission building before being dragged away by police. 
GJN executive director Nick Dearden said Saturday , “The signing ceremony . . . means that CETA has been brought back from the dead for now—but it is a ticking time bomb. The Wallonia parliament has a promise that they will be able to stop the ratification of CETA when they get a formal vote on it, and unless there are substantial changes, they—and hopefully other parliaments—will use that veto.” 
“CETA would open up our government to a deluge of court cases by North American multinational corporations and investors,” Dearden continued. “It presents a threat to our ability to protect the environment, to protect the public and to limit the power of big banks. It’s thoroughly undemocratic and must be stopped.”

21183,Iraqi Forces Take Eastern Mosul From Islamic State - The New York Times,"Iraq’s government forces said on Wednesday that they had gained control of the eastern half of Mosul, three months after they began an assault to retake the northern city from Islamic State militants. The Iraqi advance  —   the biggest military operation in the years since the United States ended its occupation of the country in 2011  —   was aided by American air support and military advisers. But after weeks of heavy fighting and high casualties in areas of Mosul east of the Tigris River, the older and more densely populated western neighborhoods of the city remain in Islamic State hands. Mosul, which was Iraq’s   city when the Islamic State seized it in 2014, has become a focal point in the broader battle to crush the Islamic State, the Sunni extremist group that claimed to have established a new Islamic caliphate in areas of Iraq and Syria. Tens of thousands of Mosul residents have fled since the Iraqi military began the recapturing operation in October, beginning with sparsely populated outer districts. Roughly a million civilians are believed to still be in the city. Members of Iraq’s counterterrorism service were the lead fighters in seizing eastern Mosul, and they faced ferocious resistance from Islamic State defenders who had planted booby traps and sent suicide bombers to stop them. American warplanes sought to block the Islamic State from reinforcing fighters in the east by bombing the Tigris bridges linking it to the western side. Lt. Gen. Talib Shaghati of the Iraqi Army said on Wednesday that his forces had effectively taken control of the eastern side, declaring that “important lines and important areas are finished. ” He spoke at a news conference in Bartella, a town east of Mosul. Prime Minister Haider   of Iraq, in a statement posted on his Twitter account, extolled what he described as “the efforts of our brave forces” to retake Mosul. It remains unclear how long it may take to clear the western half, which is characterized by narrow streets that could make the fight against entrenched Islamic State fighters even more treacherous. The triumphal moment on Wednesday was tempered by growing exasperation in the western city of Falluja, where Iraqi forces and allied militias routed Islamic State fighters more than six months ago. Many neighborhoods were destroyed in that battle, and residents have increasingly complained that much of the city remains uninhabitable. In a dispatch from the   Falluja, Agence   quoted civilians as saying the lack of reconstruction, services and jobs threatened to rekindle the resentment toward the   government in Baghdad that had helped incubate support for the Islamic State among some members of the Sunni Arab minority. Iraqi officials have said they lack money for reconstruction, hobbled by the country’s overreliance on its oil industry, which has been repeatedly disrupted by war and depressed by low prices.",0

21187,"Make Pakistan Free Afghan/Pashtun National Hero, Shabat Gula","By Kadir A. Mohmand on October 30, 2016 
“SEARCH FOR THE AFGHAN GIRL”© Steve McCurry 
I am writing on behalf of the Afghan villagers like Sharbat Gula because the U. S. installed Afghan administration only works on behalf of the occupiers and war profiteers. The Afghan administration does not care about Sharbat Gula. 
Shame on you Pakistan for imprisoning the national Afghan war hero, Sharbat Gula , who is again suffering because of the foreign occupier’s and its Afghan puppets’ bombardment of her village in Afghanistan. Sharbat Gula is now suffering at the greedy hands of Pakistan, who financially benefits from the U.S. war against the Afghans/Pashtun. 
In the 1980s, her young face on the cover of National Geographic embodied the strength, dignity and honor of the Afghan Pashtun women, who suffered for a decade at the hands of the Soviet invaders and Afghan communist puppets. 
During both wars, Pakistan has profited from the Afghans’ suffering. After 9/11, the National Geographic editor/photographer located Sharbat Gula. He told her a lot of money had been made from the edition with her cover and what did she want. She did not want money. Sharbat Gula only wanted an education for her children and no bombardment of her village. She wanted education and peace without foreign invasion. 
Her village has been bombarded by the U.S. and its puppets, her village’s water poisoned and her family has had to flee to Pakistan. Instead of honoring her, Pakistan imprisons her for not having the right papers. Also Pakistan punishes the Afghan Pashtun refugees because the Afghan Freedom fighters do not want Pakistan involved in peace negotiations. . The Afghan Freedom Fighters d o not want a repeat of the mistakes that occurred in the 1980s when Pakistan was involved in the peace talks between the Soviet Union and the Afghan Resistance. 
Sharbat Gula is again the face of the Afghan Pashtun women,. Despite the indignities of war, she keeps her honor and dignity. 
Pakistan needs to release her immediately. Perpetrators of war crimes committed against the Afghan Pashtun women need to be prosecuted and stopped. She is a victim. Sharbat Gula has human rights. The illegal war in Afghanistan must end now. Sharbat Gula has the right to live with dignity and security in her village in Afghanistan. She does not want to be forced to live in Pakistan. Enough of these greedy profiteers and this ugly war scape goating honorable Afghan Pashtun women like Sharbat Gula, who are the true national heroes. Sharbat Gula is an Afghan National Hero and not a criminal. The war criminals and war profiteers need to be imprisoned and not her. Free her now.

21188,"Newsweek Publishes Robert Reich Conspiracy Theory, Claims Berkeley Rioters Were Paid by Breitbart - Breitbart","Newsweek have published a conspiracy theory written by UC Berkeley’s Professor of Public Policy and former Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, questioning whether the   rioters at Berkeley last week were paid by Breitbart News. [“Thursday night, Yiannopoulos had a friendly interview on Fox News’s ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’  —   a show that, according to the Washington Post, has ridden anger at   activism into    prime time ratings,” wrote Reich on Saturday. “Yiannopoulos wasn’t asked about the content of the speech that was shut down. The conversation focused instead on how Berkeley proved the point that the Left was ceding its right to federal grants by cracking down on free speech. Which raises the possibility that Yiannopoulos and Brietbart were in cahoots with the agitators, in order to lay the groundwork for a Trump crackdown on universities and their federal funding. ”  After repeatedly misspelling “Breitbart,” Reich then asked his readers to “connect these dots,” in typical conspiracy theory form, before adding “I don’t want to add to the conspiratorial musings of so many about this very conspiratorial administration, but it strikes me there may be something worrying going on here. ” Reich, who works directly for the college administration at Berkeley, has repeatedly floated this conspiracy theory since the riot last week. He first suggested it in a CNN segment with host Don Lemon. In addition to not shutting down Reich when he made his baseless allegation, CNN’s Lemon egged him on from the start, opening his segment by saying that the violence at Berkeley “played right into the hands of the   white supremacist   …     someone like Milo Yiannopoulos. ” Then, instead of challenging Reich’s allegations, Lemon asked him to expand on them. “You think this was a strategy by Yiannopoulos or  ? They put this on in an effort to show that there’s no free speech on a college campus like UC Berkeley?” Reich went on to say that he “wouldn’t bet against it. ” “Despite admitting explicitly that the claim was not based on facts, Reich charged ahead in claiming that Breitbart News had an affiliation with the violent rioters that lit fires around campus and beat and pepper sprayed the MILO supporters who were waiting to get into the venue,” reported Breitbart News’ Tom Ciccotta last week, after Reich initially pitched the conspiracy. Rush Limbaugh also mocked Reich’s claims on his own show. The riot started at UC Berkeley on Wednesday after protesters against Breitbart Senior Editor MILO became increasingly violent outside of his show. “ ” started several fires, smashed windows and ATMs, looted downtown stores, attacked cars, and assaulted dozens of MILO fans, male and female, who they falsely accused of being “Nazis. ” Despite the large amount of violence, numerous reports indicate that police officers refused to intervene, and only one suspect was arrested. On Sunday, Breitbart News reported that one of the groups behind the riot, Refuse Fascism, had received $50, 000 from a group backed by socialist billionaire George Soros. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself!  Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

21193,Why FBI Director James Comey did the wrong thing ... again,"License DMCA 
The New York Times headline article sums up Comey's dilemma aptly enough. 
""Mr. Comey could immediately inform Congress about the emails, which were found in an investigation into former Representative Anthony D. Weiner. That unusual step, months after Mr. Comey had cleared Mrs. Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing in the email case, would risk accusations that he was unfairly harming her presidential campaign less than two weeks before the election. 
""Or he could delay any announcement and examine the new emails more closely, risking criticism that he had suppressed important new information if it came out after the election, despite his pledges of ""transparency"" in the investigation."" 
And with that, the choice should have been obvious -- Comey shouldn't have made any announcement. There shouldn't have been a decision to make. - Advertisement - 
That there was even a choice in Comey's mind comes back to the same thing that's caused the FBI Director to err at every single stage of this investigation. It's not that ""Jim Comey is an apolitical straight shooter,"" as every talking head is eager to tell you. It's that Jim Comey is very concerned that he be seen as an apolitical straight shooter. Because of that, he has, repeatedly, put preservation of his own reputation ahead of both justice and the good of the nation. 
From his ludicrous, finger-wagging press gaggle in announcing Clinton's innocence, to his ham-fisted intrusion into the final act of the election, Comey has felt compelled to insert Jim Comey, straight-shooter, into every moment. 
As a result he's caused serious harm to the FBI, to the election, and to the nation. And, just incidentally, he's ruined his reputation in the process. 
Across the nation, prosecuting attorneys are not exactly the most modest or retiring of public servants. It's a position of unique power, and often engages the most vaunting egos. And yet, Comey has managed to shock those people whose responsibilities are most like his own. 
""'It is not the function of the FBI director to be making public pronouncements about an investigation, never mind about an investigation based on evidence that he acknowledges may not be significant,' [former assistant U.S. attorney] Akerman added. 'The job of the FBI is simply to investigate and to provide the results of its investigation to the prosecutorial arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. His job is not to give a running commentary about any investigation or his opinion about any investigation. This is particularly egregious since Secretary Clinton has no way to respond to what amounts to nebulous and speculative innuendo.'"" - Advertisement - 
It's not enough for Comey to do his job. He wants to be seen doing his job. He worries about the eyes of history, the verdict of time. Which is exactly where, and why, Comey failed. 
Doing the right thing means doing what you believe is proper even if the verdict of history comes against you. It means being willing to be seen as biased, or not transparent, or simply wrong. Doing the right thing risks finding that what you did was actually wrong. You must act on what you know, and do the best regardless. 
But Comey was more concerned that he be seen as doing the right thing. And that's ... a completely different thing. 
In essence, James Comey set his ego above the good of the country. That's not illegal, but it's certainly not right.",0
21194,Schumer: Democrats Will Attempt to Filibuster Gorsuch,"WASHINGTON —  Senate Democrats will attempt to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) announced on Thursday during a speech on the Senate floor. [This is the fourth day of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Gorsuch, who currently serves on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Although the more liberal members of the committee tried to provoke Gorsuch, the Colorado judge remained poised and disciplined during his testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday, avoiding any missteps.  That part of the hearing process is now over, and senators are now listening to witnesses for and against the nomination. Gorsuch appears to continue headed toward a successful confirmation in the   Senate. But today Schumer criticized what he called Gorsuch’s “lack of candor and desire to answer” questions before the committee. He then announced, “After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court. ” While it only takes a simple majority of 51 votes in the   Senate to confirm a nominee, Schumer then went on to say that Gorsuch “will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation. ” This means a filibuster. Under Senate Rule 22, for any question involving debate, if senators wish to continue speaking, it takes a   vote of the full Senate (60 out of 100) to invoke a motion for cloture, which limits debate to no more than 30 additional hours, after which a final vote must be held. When senators insist on continuing debate until cloture shuts them down, it’s called a filibuster. Filibusters have historically been for legislative debates only, not judicial nominations. The first time in American history that a filibuster was used to stop any judicial nomination was 2003, when Senate Democrats filibustered President George W. Bush’s nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, followed soon thereafter by other Bush judicial nominees. The only previous filibuster attempt ever made over a judge was in 1968 against the nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to become chief justice and replace Earl Warren. However, a majority of senators went on record saying they would vote against Fortas in any event, so it was not the filibuster that stopped Fortas. It was instead lacking enough votes to confirm him. For Estrada, by contrast, a majority of the Senate went on record supporting his confirmation, so it was the   threshold for cloture obstructing an    vote that defeated his nomination. The architect of the   strategy of using a filibuster to block an    vote on judicial nominations was none other than Schumer, who at the time had only been in the Senate for less than five years, and was not in a leadership position. In November 2014,   Leader Harry Reid ( ) reinterpreted the rules of the Senate so that the filibuster could not be used on any presidential nominations except the Supreme Court, clearing the way for Democrats to confirm several nominations that Republicans had blocked. This tactic has been called the “constitutional option” by some, and the “nuclear option” by others. With Schumer’s announcement that he will lead a filibuster of Gorsuch’s nomination, Republicans must either pick up eight Democrats to join Republicans in voting for cloture, or Republicans must hold together at least 50 of their 52 members (with Vice President Mike Pence as a  ) to extend the constitutional option to Supreme Court nominations. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Gorsuch out of committee on April 3, sending the nomination to the Senate floor for this filibuster showdown.

21196,The Genocide of Indigenous Peoples in North America and Palestine-Israel - American Herald Tribune,"Prof. Tony Hall Speaks Out on Mohawk Territory 2 Shares
1 0 0 1
Prof. Hall speaks at the Haldimand Deed Recognition Dinner at Kanata in the Mohawk Village near Brantford Ontario. Prof. Hall has been the target of a witch hunt mounted by Facebook and by B'nai Brith Canada. The mission of the Canadian branch of the Anti-Defamation League is to provide Zionist advocacy for ""the security of Israel.""
In late August of 2016 a maliciously engineered smear item was placed on Prof. Hall's FB page without his knowledge or consent. The B'nai Brith immediately publicized the offensive content of the post to introduce a concerted smear and disinformation campaign implying falsely that Dr. Hall seeks to ""Kill All Jews."" The B'nai Brith exploited its grotesque misrepresentation of Dr. Hall's academic work to call on its membership to flood the administrative offices of the University of Lethbridge with letters and petition signatures. The object is to remove Dr. Hall from his teaching post. Dr. Hall remains a tenured full professor whose career as a university teacher began in 1982.
The University of Lethbridge's administration soon surrendered to this Zionist campaign aimed at disabling an outspoken critic of Israel's genocidal treatment of the Aboriginal Palestinians. On Oct. 4 the U of L president, Dr. Mike Mahon, suspended Dr. Hall without pay. He undertook this assault on the principles of academic freedom in the complete absence of any due process of third-party arbitration whatsoever.
The attack on Dr. Hall is an attack on the institution of academic tenure, a mainstay of protection for academic freedom in institutions of higher learning. The University of Lethbridge Faculty Association and the Canadian Association of University Teachers have identified the illegal nature of Dr. Mahon's unprecedented assault on the core principles of tenure and academic freedom.
In his talk sponsored by the Mohawks of the Grand River, Dr. Hall put the Zionist/Facebook campaign directed at disabling critics of Israel in a broader historical context. The assault on the Palestinian people extends the genocidal holocaust directed at the Indigenous peoples of the Americas since 1492. Israeli techniques directed at terminating the Palestinian presence draw on the genocidal techniques directed at Native Americans in the expansionary course of US history.

21197,"On Same Day Massive Layoffs Begin, ESPNW Celebrates Black Power Icon and Fugitive Cop Killer - Breitbart","Proving that it has not learned that its customers tire of   politics forced into sports reporting, on the same day that sports cable network ESPN fired 100   employees and reporters, ESPN Women devoted its webpages to extreme   social justice, resistance, and feminism. [Indeed, ESPNW used a claimed “honoring” of National Poetry Month as an excuse to “reflect on resistance, redefining feminism and movement. ”  What followed were poems from five professors, writers, and activists filled with revolution, resistance,   and race baiting. The first piece, penned by Dr. DaMaris B. Hill, a professor of African American and Africana Studies at the University of Kentucky, is titled simply “Revolution. ” It celebrates the violence and force of revolution, and is specifically dedicated to black power icon Asatta Shakur, who murdered a police officer in 1977. In 1979 Shakur escaped from prison and sought asylum in Cuba, where she remains to this day. Shakur was also the first woman named to the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorist List, and there is currently a $1 million reward leading to her arrest. Amusingly, Dr. Hill seems to admit that the liberals “revolution” has nothing to do with “facts” by writing, “Revolution ain’t got sh —   to do with facts. It is all faith!” That sounds about right, since liberals have no facts or truth on hand with their “revolution. ” It’s all just a religion  —   or a replacement thereof  —   to them. After Dr. Hill, ESPNW moved on to a piece titled, “What Leaps from a Storm’s Throat,” by   of Staten Island professor Patricia Smith. This second poem contains a line that slams capitalism, reading, “beneath vendors who heartlessly hawk the stupid slap of sugar, spirit and salt. ” Next, Wisconsin writer Carrie Ann Welsh’s “Start Here,” seemed to posit that only minority women play sports, with a line saying, “Their bodies are too dark, too wiry, too big, too fast. ” Finally, New York arts and culture administrator DéLana R. A. Dameron, made her entire piece about whites oppressing blacks. In Dameron’s poem, entitled “My Struggle with Feminism is Black,” black women are presented as having no freedom. Daeron insists black women are “in the service of white folks. ” Dameron even poked her poetic finger in the eyes of liberal, white women who think they support the liberation of black women by noting that   white women found it easy to stomp around advocating for free black women when black women weren’t teachers or even living in the same neighborhoods as those white women. “Don’t let those white girls turn you into a mammy. You are not there to take care of them, get yours,” Dameron’s screed said. So, as these “poets” are pushing   race hatred, and resistance, ESPN is once again seen pushing far left,   liberalism onto its sports fans. Will they ever learn?

21198,Never the Noodles Shall Meet: A Chinese Treaty Is Tested - The New York Times,"Amid the modern skyscrapers of Shanghai, the parties to a   treaty are at war. At stake are the spoils of a   industry and a minority group’s ability to retain its customs in a   China. Also, noodles. When Xian Gulin opened a halal restaurant in Shanghai last month that serves   beef noodles, he hoped patrons would line up at his door. What he got instead was an entrance blocked for weeks by protesters. The protesters, like Mr. Xian, were Hui, a Muslim ethnic minority, originally from China’s northwest. They accused the restaurateur of violating the    Treaty, a social pact that prohibits the Hui from opening halal noodle shops within 400 meters of each other  —   roughly 1, 300 feet. To appease the protesters, Mr. Xian eventually agreed to take down the halal insignia from his storefront. The origins of the treaty are unknown, but restaurateurs say it originally capped the number of noodle shops in a Hui village at one. As more Hui began moving eastward into China’s growing coastal cities, they brought a variant of the treaty with them. “For the Hui as a community, maintaining their halal traditions and restaurants has been critical to their survival, so it’s not surprising that in a highly capitalized society, these rivalries would bubble to the surface,” said Dru Gladney, an anthropology professor at Pomona College in California and an expert on Chinese ethnic minorities. The halal food industry has flourished in China as the country has pursued closer economic relations with   Middle Eastern nations. In Qinghai Province alone, sales of halal food products in 2014 totaled about $2. 8 billion. On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, online commenters condemned the protests. Even the Islamic Association of Qinghai got involved, declaring the boycott of Mr. Xian’s restaurant a violation of “fair competition” that caused “social instability. ” Still, Hui restaurateurs insist that the treaty is more necessary than ever. “We worked so hard to climb our way up, so we can’t tolerate people who do not respect the treaty,” said Ma Yi Buo La, 37, who owns a halal noodle shop in Shanghai. “People who don’t abide by the treaty, they’re not good people,” he said. Yet enforcement of the treaty is increasingly difficult as halal cuisine becomes more popular across China. “It was a tradition in our villages back home, but I don’t think anyone really respects this treaty anymore in large cities,” said Ma Kefu, 19, a Gansu native who now works at a halal restaurant in Beijing. To make his point, he gestured across the street. No more than 15 feet away stood another halal restaurant, its intricate halal insignia prominently on display.",0
21199,LGBT Writer: I Won’t Accept Gay Conservatives ‘Coming Out’ as Trump Supporters - Breitbart,"LGBT writer Skylar   refused to accept homosexuals who “come out” as supporters of President Trump in a new article for The Independent, encouraging others in the LGBT community to cut ties with gay conservatives. [In the article,   responded to OUT magazine’s Chadwick Moore, who came out as a conservative on Saturday and explained how the   LGBT community started to ignore, reject, and cut ties with him after he wrote a neutral profile on Breitbart Senior Editor MILO and expressed conservative political beliefs.  “Gay conservatives aren’t welcome in gay spaces because the people they support are an existential threat to our rights and our community,” claimed   condemning homosexual conservatives including Moore and MILO. “After all, queer spaces (such as bars, bathhouses, community centres, and even bookstores) were founded and instrumental in radical sexual politics and political engagement. You can’t divorce that from the social aspect, because doing so would deny the history of our community and the present reality of so many vulnerable LGBT people. ” “Asking that the gay community embrace you and your politics is like one turkey asking another to be okay that he voted for the farmer and Thanksgiving,” he continued. “I don’t care if this hurts someone’s feelings I’m more concerned with the harm their vote causes. So until American conservatism welcomes queer people, queer people shouldn’t welcome American conservatives. Even if they’re queer themselves. Sorry, Chad. Maybe Milo will buy you a drink. ”   further attacked homosexual conservatives on his Twitter account, where he added: “I have no time for gay American conservatives. Go cry your tears elsewhere. ” I have no time for gay American conservatives. Go cry your tears elsewhere. My latest for the Independent: https:  .   —   Skylar   (@SkylarJordan) February 13, 2017,  During his article coming out as a conservative on Saturday, Chadwick Moore explained how he had been ousted from LGBT circles and cut off from his best friend, who no longer wanted to have anything to do with him. “I decided to go out to my local gay bar in Williamsburg, where I’ve been a regular for 11 years. I ordered a drink but nothing felt the same half the place  —   people with whom I’d shared many laughs  —   seemed to be giving me the cold shoulder,” Moore recalled. “Upon seeing me, a friend who normally greets me with a hug and kiss pivoted and turned away  …     My best friend, with whom I typically hung out multiple times per week, was suddenly perpetually unavailable. Finally, on Christmas Eve, he sent me a long text, calling me a monster, asking where my heart and soul went, and saying that all our other friends are laughing at me. ” “I began to realize that maybe my opinions just didn’t fit in with the liberal status quo, which seems to mean that you must absolutely hate Trump, his supporters and everything they believe,” he concluded, adding, “It can seem like liberals are actually against free speech if it fails to conform with the way they think. And I don’t want to be a part of that club anymore. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech. You can follow him on Twitter @MrNashington or like his page at Facebook.",0
21201,Gaming’s Biggest Stage to Be Open to the Public for E3 2017 - Breitbart,"The Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) the largest trade show for the gaming industry, will open its doors to 15, 000 of its most devoted consumers in 2017. [On Monday, February 13, the Entertainment Software Association will open limited ticket sales to what is arguably the most important trade show in the gaming industry. E3 will welcome fifteen thousand fans to join developers, publicists, and members of the media in June. The first 1, 000 to purchase their tickets will gain access for $150. The remainder will need to pay $250 to gain entrance to the ESA’s chaotic digital wonderland.  While E3 attendance has never been officially public, prior to 2007 the credentials needed for entry were relatively broad. 2007’s   restructuring attempted to curtail the growing crowd but culled much of the event’s excitement along with the vast majority of its attendees. This year’s expo looks to capture the   enthusiasm of eager consumers while taking reasonable precautions not to flood the show floor to the point of obstruction. ESA Senior VP of Communications Rich Taylor called it “a strategic decision” for “a changing industry,” made possible “thanks to our members and their vision and leadership. ” According to Taylor, they’ve been listening: The feedback we heard was clear —  they wanted to play the games inside the convention center. In addition, exhibitors inside the convention center wanted to have access to the fans. So this year we’re bringing the two together. Is this a step in the right direction for the world’s most famous industry event? Will it bring back some of the major publishers that have decided to host their own separate shows in the recent past? And, most importantly, will I see you at this year’s E3?

21202,Iran Accuses Thomson Reuters Charity Official of Sedition - The New York Times,"TEHRAN  —   A   employee of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, arrested in Iran more than two months ago for unexplained reasons, has been accused of plotting to overthrow the government, Iranian news media reported Wednesday. The detainee, Nazanin   37, is a program coordinator for the foundation, the independent charitable arm of the Thomson Reuters news agency. Both the foundation and Ms.  ’s British husband, Richard Ratcliffe, denied the accusations. Ms.   was arrested on April 3 in Tehran and taken to the provincial city of Kerman in southern Iran, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps provided to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Her    daughter, Gabriella, who had accompanied her to Iran for a visit with family, is staying with maternal grandparents. The child’s passport was confiscated by the Iranian authorities, severely complicating any possibility of reuniting her with Mr. Ratcliffe. “The British national, Nazanin Zaghari, who was arrested by the intelligence department of the Sarallah Corps of Kerman, has participated in coup plots,” the Revolutionary Guards statement read. “Through membership in foreign companies and institutions, she has participated in designing and executing media and cyberplots with the aim of the peaceful overthrow of the Islamic Republic establishment. ” The statement also accused Ms.   of being “one of the chief members of networks of adversary institutions, who  —   with the direction and support of foreign media and espionage services  —   has committed her criminal acts over the past few years. ” Mr. Ratcliffe was quoted by Reuters as calling the accusations against his wife “preposterous” charges that appeared to be a political case. He has been outspoken in calling for her release and started an online petition that now has more than 764, 000 signatures. The Revolutionary Guards statement seemed directed at the Thomson Reuters company, a global media powerhouse regarded with suspicion and hostility in Iran because of its British foundations. Reuters merged with Canada’s Thomson company in 2008. “The media corporations of hegemonic governments, especially the   British media, have made their best efforts in the recent months to support her in order to weaken the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ determination but this false hope will never come true,” the statement added. In 2012 Thomson Reuters’ press accreditation was suspended in Iran after the news agency was accused of having lied in a video report that asserted Iranian housewives were training to become ninja assassins. (A misleading headline in the report was corrected.) The suspended accreditation followed the closing of the British Embassy in Tehran after it had been attacked by   protesters. The government of President Hassan Rouhani has reportedly been in discussions to allow a Thomson Reuters bureau to reopen.   are opposed to what they view as increased influence by Westerners. Ms.   has never worked inside Iran, according to a statement released on Wednesday by the Thomson Reuters Foundation chief executive, Monique Villa. “Nazanin has been working at the Thomson Reuters Foundation for the past four years as a project coordinator in charge of grants applications and training, and had no dealing with Iran in her professional capacity,” the statement said. “The Thomson Reuters Foundation has no dealings with Iran whatsoever, does not operate and does not plan to operate in the country. ” The intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards has arrested several dual citizens over recent months. The latest such arrest was last week, when a   professor researching women, Homa Hoodfar, was arrested on undisclosed charges. The semiofficial Mashregh news organization reported Wednesday that she was accused of collaborating with two organizations that “are working to diminish religiosity and equal gender rights. ” Mashregh criticized the two organizations, Women Living Under Muslim Laws, and Hivos, a human rights advocacy group based in The Hague, for “emphasizing women’s control of their own bodies and choosing to live single. ”",0
21203,Feds Establish Support Program for Victims of Criminal Aliens,"Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John F. Kelly ordered the director of U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to create a program to assist the victims of crimes committed by illegal aliens. The program creates a liaison and authorizes the disclosure of suspect immigration statuses and other pertinent data. [Secretary Kelly ordered the creation of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office to help reverse policies of the previous administration that kept certain information about criminal aliens the victims of their crimes.  “Criminal aliens routinely victimize Americans and other legal residents,” Kelly wrote in a   memo obtained by Breitbart Texas. “Often, these victims are not provided adequate information about the offender, the offender’s immigration status, or any enforcement action taken by ICE against the offender. ” I am establishing the [VOICE] Office within the Office of the Director of ICE, which will create a programmatic liaison between ICE and the known victims of crimes committed by removable aliens,” the secretary explained. “The liaison will facilitate engagement with the victims and their families to ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that they are provided information about the offender, including the offender’s immigration status and custody status, and that their questions and concerns regarding immigration enforcement efforts are addressed. ” Kelly ordered the acting ICE director to immediately reallocate any and all resources that were previously allocated to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens to now be used to support VOICE. He ordered the immediate termination of any outreach or advocacy services to illegal aliens. The memo supporting President Donald Trump’s “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States” Executive Order also included the authorization to hire an additional 10, 000 ICE agents and enforcement officers to help in the massive task of rounding up criminal aliens before they can commit further crimes, Breitbart Texas reported. The 680 illegal aliens rounded up in the latest targeted enforcement operation carried out earlier this month represents a tiny fraction of the criminal aliens present in the U. S. according to DHS estimates. A December study by the Center for Immigration Studies estimated there are 820, 000 criminal illegal aliens in the U. S. not deported by the Obama Administration. Courts had convicted many of these aliens for crimes including murder, rape, drug offenses, other crimes, or who had final orders of removal from an immigration judge that was not enforced, Breitbart News reported. Often, the mainstream media refuse to include information about the immigration status of a criminal alien —  even after other outlets research and release said information. An example is a Mexican national illegally present in the United States that killed a Houston, Texas, pastor and his wife while he was engaged in street racing. All local media outlets referred to the criminal alien in vague and misleading terms like “Houston man,” or “a man,” Breitbart Texas reported. The omitted information continued to spread despite previous coverage by Breitbart Texas of the case revealing the Mexican national’s illegal immigrant status seven months earlier. The order from Secretary Kelly to provide additional information and resources to victims of illegal alien crime is effective immediately.

21211,"Ubisoft Reveals Sales Down for Quarter, Hipster-Sim ’Watch Dogs 2’ Launch ’Soft’ - Breitbart","Gaming publisher Ubisoft revealed that sales were down 6% for the 3rd fiscal quarter compared to the previous year while Watch Dogs 2‘s launch wasn’t what they had hoped for. [Ubisoft’s 3rd quarter was as much a mixed bag of victory and defeat. While winter sports sim Steep outperformed its relatively muted expectations,   simulator Watch Dogs 2 wasn’t quite as “dynamic” as the company expected with a “soft” launch. Still, it reportedly managed to outperform last year’s shaky Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate launch.  While interest in MMO shooter The Division has dwindled since its blockbuster release, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot did report a 152% jump in active players since the game’s big October update. Meanwhile, tactical multiplayer shooter Rainbow Six: Siege is healthier than ever, with over 15 million registered players and the highest daily activity yet in a community that continues to expand. Moreover, back catalog games like the aforementioned The Division and Rainbow Six: Siege are driving profits further than usual. Ubisoft’s continued support of their older titles is paying off, and the lack of a 2016 entry in the Assassin’s Creed franchise seems to have boosted the sales of previous games in the series. Guillemot said that Ubisoft is “successfully pursuing our transformation into a more recurring and more profitable profile” and that “the positive effects of this transformation are remarkable. ” Finally, Ubisoft reported about $213 million for the Assassin’s Creed movie, a “solid first step. ” While it didn’t exactly wow the critics, gamers around the world seem to have enjoyed seeing the titular Assassins struggle against the machinations of Abstergo’s Templars on the big screen. Ubisoft will be releasing the next major entry this year in the Assassin’s Creed franchise and has delayed South Park: The Fractured But Hole into fiscal year 2017, which could help improve their fortunes over last year.

21212,Watch: Peter Schweizer Details How John Podesta May Have Violated Federal Law - Breitbart,"Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Breitbart editor at large Peter Schweizer, the author of “Clinton Cash,” detailed how the former chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign John Podesta may have violated federal law by failing to disclose stock shares he owned from a   company.  Schweizer said, “In 2011, John Podesta joins the board of this very small energy company called Joule Energy based out of Massachusetts. About two months after he joins the board of a Russian entity called Rusnano, puts a billion rubles which is about    into John Podesta’s company. Now, what is Rusnano? It’s not a private company, Steve. It is a fund directly funded by the Kremlin. In fact, the Russian science minister called Rusnano, Putin’s child. So you have the Russian government investing in one John Podesta’s businesses in 2011, while he is an advisor to Hillary Clinton at the State Department. ” He continued, “So then in 2013, he goes to the White House, to be a special counselor to Barack Obama, and that requires that you, you know, have financial disclosures every year. In his financial disclosure form in 2013, he not only fails to disclose these 75, 000 shares of stock that he has in Joule Energy which is funded in part by the Russian government. He also fails to disclose that he is on one of the three corporate board that this entity has. It’s got this very complex ownership structure. He discloses he is on the company in Massachusetts, that is he on the board of a company in the Netherlands, but he fails to disclose that he is also on the executive order of the holding company. That’s a clear violation of the disclosure rules that needs to be looked at. ” He added, “What makes the Podesta case clear is there was a transfer of money and there was a transfer of a lot of money that stood to make John Podesta a lot of money. That is unique and that’s extremely troubling because at the time that transfer is taking place he is advising Hillary Clinton at the State Department. We know that from the Podesta emails that he is helping her make personnel decisions, speech decisions, policy decisions. He is meeting with her monthly. It’s a transfer of money from a foreign government, at the time, that is he was advising America’s chief diplomat, Hillary Clinton. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
21214,Florida Gun Range Teaches 5-Year-Olds to Shoot,"Jacksonville Clay Target Sports (JCTS) believes education is the key to stopping accidental shootings, so they are teaching kids as young as five gun safety and usage. [JCTS teaches “about 50 children a day how to properly shoot and handle a gun. ”  According to First Coast News, Safety Officer Larry Freeman watches over JCTS. He said his dad taught him to use a gun at seven, adding, “He taught me gun safety as a young one and I’ve carried that all through my life. ” Freeman observed: You get rid of the mystique of the gun. That way, now they know what it can do, they’ve seen what it can do and they’ve been taught what it can do. And then they’ll know what to tell their parents if they find one, they won’t be sneaking it off to see how it works and wind up killing somebody. Jacksonville parent Tony Knight agrees with Freeman. He gave his son, Tony Knight Jr. his first gun at age three and says he still stands with Jr. when he shoots, placing his hand on his shoulder to give him support. Knight said he thinks following through —  continuing to teach safety and helping them use the gun —  is an important part of the learning process. He believes there is no magic age at which someone can begin learning. Rather, a child who can “learn and listen and follow directions” is “ready to be taught the gun. ” Knight’s son said, “People may use them wrong and I think that’s wrong. People should use them for hunting, shooting targets and other stuff, but not harming people. ” He also noted that his father taught him to respect firearms, saying, “It can hurt people, yeah dad taught me it can hurt people. ” Jr. added, “If I see a gun in my house I’m supposed to leave it alone and tell my parents and if they’re not home just leave it alone. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

21218,Agents Accuse Feds of Covering Up Record Border Detainee Numbers for 2016 Election,"Agents Accuse Feds of Covering Up Record Border Detainee Numbers for 2016 Election Brandon Darby, Breitbart, October 30, 2016 
A record number of illegal aliens have crossed the U.S.- Mexico border and are in U.S. Border Patrol custody in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV), according to the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC). Border Patrol Agent and NBPC President Brandon Judd spoke exclusively with Breitbart Texas and condemned the leadership of the Border Patrol’s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), for allegedly “keeping this information secret” ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
“We are at breaking point. We have the highest number of illegal aliens in custody in history in Border Patrol’s RGV Sector and this information has been kept from the American public,” said Agent Judd. “The talk of amnesty has once again created pull factors and encouraged people from all over the world to cross Mexico and then cross our porous southern border to illegally enter the U.S. We are simply overwhelmed.” {snip} 
Agent Judd told Breitbart Texas that Americans should vote their conscience, but they should do so with all of the information available. “This is an issue of the federal government restricting crucial information from the public ahead of a presidential election and it is unacceptable. Americans deserve to know the truth. Our Border Patrol agents deserve for Americans to know what they are really facing. Too many Border Patrol agents have given their lives and left loved ones to grieve for CBP leadership to play these types of political games ahead of such an impactful election.” 
{snip} 
Historically, CBP, Border Patrol’s parent agency, has had to correct false assertions and denials. Perhaps the most glaring example occurred in June 2014 when an official CBP Twitter account directly accused this reporter of publishing a false report, only to later admit the report was accurate and true . 
{snip} 
UPDATE: Breitbart Texas received this response from CBP: 
First, the number in custody in RGV is less than half what is was in June 2014. 
Also, I would refer you to Secretary Johnson’s statement about southwest border security issued October 17. In it, the Secretary addresses the specific issue of unaccompanied children and family units. The statement includes statistics for the full year of fiscal year 2016.

21219,Oliver Stone: Trump-Russia Connection a ’Path That Leads Nowhere’,"Director Oliver Stone believes Democrats’ repeated inquiries into alleged connections between President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russian government is a “path that leads nowhere. ”[In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald to discuss his latest documentary  —   about Russian President Vladimir Putin  —   Stone discussed his experience interacting with the Russian leader and what his documentary aims to convey to a Western audience.  “It’s not a documentary as much as a question and answer session,” he said. “Mr. Putin is one of the most important leaders in the world and in so far as the United States has declared him an enemy  —   a great enemy  —   I think it’s very important we hear what he has to say. ” The documentary will reportedly focus on Putin’s version of events since he became president of Russia in 2000. “It opens up a whole viewpoint that we as Americans haven’t heard,” Stone said. “We went to see him four different times over two years. ” Stone reportedly discussed a number of topics with President Putin, including the case of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. He also noted that the Russian president “talks pretty straight,” and hopes his documentary can help explain Putin’s points of view to a Western audience. When questioned about allegations made by Democrats and the political left that President Trump has direct connections to Russia, Stone replied: “That’s a path that leads nowhere to my mind. ” “That’s an internal war of politics in the US in which the Democratic party has taken a suicide pact or something to blow him up in other words, to completely   him and in so doing blow up the US essentially,” he said. “What they’re doing is destroying the trust that exists between people and government. It’s a very dangerous position to make accusations you cannot prove. ” Read the Sydney Morning Herald‘s full interview with Stone here.

He described Mr. Castro, who ruled as a Communist autocrat for almost 50 years, as “Cuba’s longest serving President. ” “While a controversial figure, both Mr. Castro’s supporters and detractors recognized his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a deep and lasting affection for ‘el Comandante,’” Mr. Trudeau continued. He added that Mr. Castro was “a legendary revolutionary and orator” whose death had brought him “deep sorrow. ” “I know my father was very proud to call him a friend and I had the opportunity to meet Fidel when my father passed away,” Mr. Trudeau said. (His father, Pierre Trudeau, served as prime minister for over 15 years.) “It was also a real honour to meet his three sons and his brother President Raúl Castro during my recent visit to Cuba. ” Justin Trudeau’s affectionate comments were a radical departure from American reactions to Mr. Castro’s death  —   the White House diplomatically said it hoped for warmer relations with Cuba, while   Donald J. Trump gleefully posted on Twitter, “Fidel Castro is dead!”  —   and his statement was quickly condemned by political observers in both the United States and Canada. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is   called the Canadian leader’s remarks “shameful and embarrassing. ” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, another   said Mr. Trudeau’s statement was “disgraceful” and accused him of “slobbering adulation” of Mr. Castro. In Canada, several members of the opposition Conservative Party condemned Mr. Trudeau’s statement. Kellie Leitch, a lawmaker running for the party’s leadership, criticized the prime minister for his “fawning characterization” of Mr. Castro. Maxime Bernier, another Conservative leadership candidate, called Mr. Trudeau’s praise “repugnant” and rebuked him for suggesting that the Cuban leader’s decades in power had amounted to a form of public service. Mr. Trudeau’s statement also generated a tidal wave of agitated online mockery, the kind of social media blowback to which the telegenic and infinitely   prime minister is rarely subjected. In a wink to the moment that brought Mr. Trudeau to national prominence  —   his televised eulogy for his father in 2000  —   jokes about his statement were organized under the hashtag #trudeaueulogies, where critics imagined him waxing poetic about some of history’s great villains. The United States broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 and imposed an embargo on the island for decades, but Canada never pursued similar policies. It began formal diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1945 and maintained them throughout the Cold War, when Mr. Trudeau’s father developed a warm relationship with Mr. Castro. Pierre Trudeau was the first leader of a NATO member state to visit communist Cuba in 1976, and Mr. Castro served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",0
21226,"Gennifer Flowers at Debate? Just Making a Point, Says Team Trump - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump’s campaign moved on Sunday to squelch reports  —   set off by the candidate himself  —   that Gennifer Flowers, the woman whose claims of an affair with Bill Clinton imperiled his 1992 presidential campaign, would be Mr. Trump’s guest on Monday at his first debate with Hillary Clinton. In television interviews on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, flatly denied that Ms. Flowers would attend the debate, at Hofstra University on Long Island. And Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said that in threatening on Saturday to invite Ms. Flowers, Mr. Trump had merely been making a point. “He wants to remind people that he’s a great counterpuncher,” Ms. Conway said on ABC’s “This Week. ” The specter of Ms. Flowers’s attendance arose during a skirmish of psychological warfare between the two campaigns and their supporters in the   to Monday night’s matchup. Mark Cuban, the voluble billionaire who owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and is supporting Mrs. Clinton, announced on Twitter on Thursday that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign had given him a   seat at the debate to watch her “overwhelm” Mr. Trump. For good measure, Mr. Cuban  —   who once hosted a   reality television show called “The Benefactor,” and more recently offered $10 million to the charity of Mr. Trump’s choice if the Republican nominee would let Mr. Cuban interview him for four hours about his “policies and their substance”  —   suggested the debate would become known as the “Humbling at Hofstra. ” On Saturday, Mr. Trump responded even more provocatively. The   Mr. Trump, whose second marriage grew out of an affair during his first one, has repeatedly raised Mr. Clinton’s infidelities as a character attack against Mrs. Clinton. Several of Mr. Trump’s advisers have a long history of calling attention to Mr. Clinton’s scandals. Ms. Flowers herself lent credence to the idea: “Yes I will be there,” she wrote in a text message to The New York Times on Saturday. She did not respond to   messages on Sunday. Each campaign receives tickets from the Commission on Presidential Debates to give to supporters at its discretion, and campaigns often engage in mind games when picking guests, as appeared to be the case with Mrs. Clinton’s choice of Mr. Cuban. But inviting Ms. Flowers would be in a different category. In 1992, Mr. Clinton denied Ms. Flowers’s claim of an affair, but years later, when asked in a deposition whether he had engaged in “sexual relations” with Ms. Flowers, he admitted having done so one time, in 1977. Ms. Flowers, in recently broadcast interviews, has accused Mrs. Clinton of being an “enabler” and has said the scandal is a relevant issue in 2016. Inviting Ms. Flowers would be risky for Mr. Trump, because he faces a potentially   gender gap with women, who might be troubled by such an aggressive and personal move. On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, portrayed Mr. Trump’s Twitter post about Ms. Flowers as yet another example of behavior unbecoming of someone seeking the presidency. “You saw his reaction, which is to do his favorite sport, which is to dive in the sewer and go for a swim,” Mr. Podesta said. But on “Fox News Sunday,” Mr. Pence, the Indiana governor, sought to put an end to the matter. “Gennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night,” Mr. Pence said. “Donald was using the tweet yesterday really to mock an effort by Hillary Clinton and her campaign to really distract attention from where the people  —   the American people  —   are going to be focused tomorrow night, which is on the issues. It’s on the choice that we face. ”",0
21227,Anxiety grows among GOP congressional staffers,"Anxiety grows among GOP congressional staffers By Wayne Madsen Posted on October 28, 2016 by Wayne Madsen 
With their bosses away campaigning, some for their political lives, a number of Republican staffers in Congress are growing anxious over their future employment. With the Senate now favored to be transferred to Democratic control, GOP staffers for members up for re-election on November 8, as well as Republican staffers assigned to various Senate committees and subcommittees, are shopping around their resumes. 
Although more senior staff can always expect to find employment with Washington’s many lobbying firms and policy-wonkish institutes and foundations, that is not necessarily the case with younger staffers who may find their future options being limited to Starbuck’s baristas and Uber drivers. 
On the House of Representatives side, Republicans are expected to lose a number of seats in a Democratic wave but GOP control of the House, barring a dramatic shift, is expected to remain in Republican hands. However, staffers for GOP members who are in close races or facing certain defeat are also scurrying around Washington looking for future employment. 
In what could be termed poetic justice, many Republican staffers who helped push their bosses’ memes against government “entitlement” programs, including unemployment benefits, may be among the first in line at District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland state unemployment offices come December.

21229,5 Killed at BPM Festival in Mexico - The New York Times,"MEXICO CITY  —   Five people were killed early Monday at a crowded nightclub in the popular Caribbean tourist destination of Playa del Carmen, Mexico, when an armed man who had been denied entry opened fire inside the club, prompting a gun battle and a stampede, officials said. Four of the victims, including three members of the security team that had blocked the gunman’s entry, were hit by bullets, and the fifth victim was trampled in the resulting pandemonium, the authorities said. The shooting occurred at the Blue Parrot nightclub, which was hosting the final night of the BPM Festival, an international electronic music event that draws fans from around the world. The gunman entered the club around 2:30 a. m. but was turned away at the door because he was carrying a weapon, said Miguel Ángel Pech, the state attorney for Quintana Roo State, on the Yucatán Peninsula. The man then opened fire, and as patrons threw themselves to the ground or rushed for the exits, security guards at the club “repelled” the attacker, Mr. Pech said, adding that the guards were apparently armed. The victims included two Canadians, a Colombian, an Italian and a Mexican, and at least 15 other people were injured, including at least three Americans, the authorities said. The gunman has not been captured or identified, but several people were detained soon after the shooting and were being held for questioning, officials said. Mr. Pech, speaking at a news conference on Monday morning, did not suggest why the gunman had tried to enter the club with a weapon, but he said the attack was not an act of terrorism. In an interview with Foro TV later in the day, the state attorney said that investigators had not discounted the possibility that the attack had something to do with a fight between criminal groups or with an extortion racket. Investigators at the scene have recovered 20 casings from three firearms, officials said, though it remained unclear whether some of the bullets had been fired by weapons belonging to the security personnel or, perhaps, to one or more patrons. Humera Hamad, a resident of El Paso, Tex. who was on vacation in Playa del Carmen, said she was in the club when the shooting started. “I couldn’t see anything,” she said in an interview. “I just heard a blast and ran out of there, then started jumping fences. ” She added, “I never looked back. ” Fabian González Camacho, 33, was standing outside the club, near the entrance, and ran for safety after the attack began. “I kept thinking: ‘This is going to be a massacre. They are going to kill us all,’” he said. Survivors sought sanctuary in other nightclubs and stores, he said. “A wave of panic, uncertainty and survival kicked in,” he said. “We were all vulnerable people, having fun, getting drunk, many also doing drugs, and then this happened. ” Videos taken after the shooting and posted online showed clubgoers rushing through the streets of the resort town and crouching beneath tables outside nearby clubs and bars, stricken faces bathed in the glow of neon lights. “We are overcome with grief over this senseless act of violence,” the BPM Festival management said in a statement posted on the company’s Facebook page. The festival is an annual   event that draws D. J. s, industry professionals and revelers from around the world to Playa del Carmen, on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatán. The shooting could put a dent in the robust tourism industry of the Yucatán, which has generally been less violent than many other places in Mexico, attracting millions of visitors to its white sand beaches and Mayan ruins.",0
21233,Hate Speech as a Weapon: Reporters Are Charged for Covering Disturbances,"Hate Speech as a Weapon: Reporters Are Charged for Covering Disturbances   26, 2016 
Editor of Austria’s Largest Paper Charged with ‘Hate Speech’ over Migrant Article … An editor of Austria’s largest paper, Kronen Zeitung, is to be tried for hate speech over a commentary he wrote about the migrant crisis last year. –Breitbart News 
This is part of a larger attack on the Western media, especially the alternative media. 
It’s surely not a coincidence that these attacks are being launched in several countries. The attack are being coordinated in our view by the same groups involved in the expanding scourge of globalization. 
More: 
On 25 October 2015, Christoph Biro wrote of the masses of migrants who were travelling through the Syrian countryside and remarked on the assaults and property damage committed by migrants, reports Kurier. 
Calling the majority of the migrants “testosterone-driven Syrians”, Mr. Biro recounted the multiple reports of migrants carrying out, in his words, “extremely aggressive sexual assaults”. 
He also detailed Afghan men had slashed the seats of the trains that were transporting them to Germany because they refused to sit where Christians had previously sat. 
Biro did not perform the acts but merely reported on them and drew a conclusion. But nonetheless he may go to jail. 
His case is not isolated but part of a trend. It is one that has reached the US, where Hillary Clinton has hinted at the adoption of similar approaches should she become president. 
In fact, both Clinton and President Barack Obama have suggested that those who are involved in “hate speech” via media presentations ought to suffer “consequences.” 
The argument is that such writing disturbs civil society and encourages violence. But this is wrongheaded. People should be prosecuted for actual violence – for deeds not words. 
ZeroHedge reports: 
A couple of days ago we noted that protests in North Dakota, over the Dakota Access Pipeline, were growing increasingly hostile with police arresting over 125 people just last weekend alone. 
Another startling discovery from the weekend was reports of police efforts to shoot down multiple media drones which some thought indicated an increasing hostility toward press seeking to cover the protests. 
Certainly, Deia Schlosberg, a documentarian who was recently charged with three felonies for filming activists shutting off oil pipelines, would tend to agree. 
The point here is that Schlosberg is not being prosecuted for deeds, only for her coverage. 
This is part of a larger effort to conflate reporting with “doing” – and marks a virtual revolution in the way journalism is conducted. 
In the future, if this tact is pursued, it will be government and law enforcement that can decide what’s going to be covered, depending on the interpretation of the coverage. 
Conclusion: If the reporting is seen as “inciting” violence or disturbance of civil society, the reporter can face legal consequences as grave or graver than the individuals actually performing the actions. This amounts to virulent censorship.",0

You are fakes, frauds, phonies and criminals. Now that you're out, stay out and don't come back. by Geoffrey Grider November 10, 2016 Donald Trump single-handedly took down the entire corrupt wing of the Republican Party 
Donald Trump’s run for the presidency over the past year and a half revealed some amazing things, it flushed out the rats that had hijacked the Republican Party like the Bush Crime Family and others. While George W. Bush declared that he and his wife Laura “ would not be voting in this election “, his father George H.W. Bush actually voted for Crooked Hillary Clinton . (If you’d like a cheat sheet of the rest of the Republirats who jumped ship, click here .) 
Why did many of the pretend Republicans not vote for Donald Trump? Because they are part of the New World Order elite globalists, and they could not possibly support Trump’s America First agenda. The Bush Crime Family, after 28 years of corrupting the GOP, was finally exposed to the sunlight and what an ugly sight it was. For more information on this topic,please read NTEB’s The Top 5 Conspiracy Theories That Were Proven To Be True Because Donald Trump Ran For President . If you are just hearing about this for the first time, it will be an eye-opener. 
The GOP is frequently referred to as the “party of Reagan” , but that’s not really a true statement. It used to be the party of Ronald Reagan after the 1980 revolution , but shortly after Reagan’s term ended it was hijacked by the Bush Crime family. For over twenty years now, the Republican Party has been a festering witches cabal of New World Order elites and Bohemian Grove acolytes. The Bush Crime Family – Three Generations of Treason 
The November 1989 edition of SPY magazine featured photos of Bohemian Grove men dancing around dressed up as women . The article included artist renditions of the Moloch idol and discussed how they bus in male prostitutes and how AIDS is a big problem. In July of 2004, a New York Post article reported how a top gay-porn star, Chad Savage, serviced the moguls at the Bohemian Grove. Bigwigs who have attended the two-week retreat include George H.W. Bush , Dick Cheney, Alan Greenspan, Walter Cronkite, Alexander Haig, Jack Kemp, Henry Kissinger , Colin Powell , John Major, William F. Buckley, Justin Dart, William Randolph Hearst, Jr., Caspar Weinberger, Charles Percy, George Schultz, Edward Teller, and former C.I.A. director William Casey. A Brief History Of Molech, the Owl, the Bushes and the Bohemian Grove: 
The corrupt liberal media all said in lockstep that Donald Trump will “ destroy the Republican party “, but it was only a half-true statement. All the people who defected when Trump was nominated were people who needed to be expunged from the Grand Old Party of Lincoln and Reagan. 
To the Bush Crime Family , Colin Powell , William Kristol , and all the other phony Republicans who were exposed, you will not be welcome in the new America under President Donald Trump. You are fakes, frauds, phonies and criminals.

The United States of America has been moving in a direction for about 30 or 40 years, where everybody gets to participate. We have been teaching our children that.

21246,Trump: ‘I’m a Nationalist and a Globalist’ - Breitbart,"On the eve of the 100 days in office milestone, President Donald Trump claims he is both a nationalist and a globalist  —   despite campaign promises that his presidency would reject globalism and put America first. [“Hey, I’m a nationalist and a globalist,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. “I’m both. ”  “And I’m the only one who makes the decision, believe me,” Trump said. But Trump also said that he would terminate NAFTA “if we’re unable to make a deal, but hopefully we won’t have to do that. ” Trump’s remarks come as debate swirls around his presidential campaign promise to end the North America Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA in contrast to his recent assertion that he will “negotiate” a revision of the treaty that has guided U. S. trade policy with Mexico and Canada since 1994. The Journal reported that Trump received almost    calls from Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Following those conversations Trump said, “They’re serious about it and I will negotiate rather than terminate. ” “Meanwhile, Sonny Perdue —  the agriculture secretary who took office two days earlier —  and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with Mr. Trump and showed him a map indicating the states where jobs would be lost if the pact collapsed, according to a person familiar with the matter,” the Journal reported, noting that many of the states on the map supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. “Those conversations, along with a flood of calls to the White House from business executives, helped steer Mr. Trump away from an idea that some of his own advisers feared was a rash and unnecessary threat to two trading partners who fully expected to renegotiate the agreement anyway,” the Journal reported. “I expect the administration to closely consult with Congress before such major   decisions are made,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch ( ) chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade. “Withdrawing from NAFTA would have significant effects on the America economy. ” Following Trump’s election in November, Chriss Street penned a commentary for Breitbart News focused on how Trump’s “America First” message would strike a blow to “world socialism. ” “The election of Donald Trump now represents an existential threat to World Socialism across the planet,” Street wrote. “Socialists know that when President Reagan went rogue with his muscular capitalist policies, communism quickly imploded. Trump has already torn up the   Partnership, which would have internationalized the law covering $28 trillion in trade and investment, about 40 percent of global GDP. “Trump seems determined to destroy “Socialist Globalization” with the same capitalist tax cuts and regulatory relief that President Reagan used to destroy communism,” Street wrote. In an interview with conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham last month, former presidential candidate and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan said abandoning his populist economic message would be “fatal” for Trump’s presidency.",0

Devin Nunes announced Wednesday that members of President Donald Trump’s transition team, including the   were “incidentally” surveilled by the intelligence community, additional names of the transition team were “unmasked,” and that the information was not obtained in relation to Russia. [Nunes recalled his recent confirmation that information on members of the Trump transition team had been incidentally collected by the intelligence community on numerous occasions. “Details about U. S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting. ”  “Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked,” said Nunes. When later asked by reporters if the President was also included in the incidental collection of information, Nunes replied, “Yes. ” In response to another reporter, Nunes said “it’s possible” that Trump’s personal communication was collected. Rep. Nunes later went on to say of “dozens” of reports he has seen thus far, “I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the   and his team were, I guess, at least monitored and disseminated out in intelligence in what appears to be  …    intelligence reporting channels. ” He added that he is, however, awaiting further information. The representative’s fourth point was emphatic, “  …    none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team. ” He made clear that the House Intelligence Committee will investigate surveillance of Trump associates and subsequent dissemination of information gathered. He stated that the goal is to determine: Who was aware of it, Why it was not disclosed to Congress, Who requested and authorized the additional unmasking, Whether anyone directed the intelligence community to focus on Trump associates, Whether any laws, regulations, or procedures were violated, Nunes said that he believes the collection was done legally, but questions remain as to unmasking and the dissemination list of information collected during the transition during the months of November, December, and January. Rep. Nunes characterized the information that was collected as “A lot of it appears like it was  …    it was essentially a lot of information on the   and his transition team and what they were doing. ” He said he has asked the Directors of FBI, NSA, and CIA to “expeditiously comply” with his March 15 letter and provide a full account of such surveillance activities. Nunes called the NSA very, very helpful. He expects additional information to come on Friday. Rep. Nunes said he has not seen any information that has anything to do with Russia or the Russian investigation. He said that while he expects more information and did not make an absolute determination on how the information was collected, “It was not criminal, it was normal, foreign surveillance is what it looked like to me, but let’s wait until we get all the information. ” “This appears to be all legally collected foreign intelligence under FISA, where there was incidental collection that then ended up in reporting channels and that was widely disseminated,” said Nunes. Rep. Nunes said he was surprised and alarmed by the discovery of this information, “because we went through this about a year and a half ago as it related to members of Congress  …    ” Nunes stated that he would travel to the White House in the afternoon to share the new information he has with President Trump.

21252,President Obama’s Interview With Samantha Bee Will Have You Rolling On The Floor Laughing (VIDEO),"  
President Obama is known for his humor, but his interview with Samantha Bee is downright hilarious. 
During his final days in office, Obama has been making rounds on talk shows. When he sat down with the host of Full Frontal this week, the result was simply priceless. 
Bee took a few shots at him for his age, asking if he would consider an appearance on Antique Roadshow and pointing out the white in his hair. Obama reminded her that he was still president, after all, but Bee was hell bent on making this an interview to remember. 
She finally asked Obama if he would “mess” with Donald Trump once he was done serving as Commander in Chief. 
“After you leave office, have you thought of just whispering in Donald Trump’s ear, ‘You were right, I wasn’t born here,’ just to, like, mess with him?” Bee asked. 
“I think it’s fair to say that I will be organizing my post-presidency where I’m not close enough to him to whisper into his ear,” Obama shot back. 
They did discuss some important issues, such as young voters and the struggles that Hillary Clinton may face as the first woman to serve as President of the United States. But the playful back and forth between President Obama and Bee is too funny to miss. It also reminds us just why it is that we are going to miss this man so much when he is gone.

21253,“The Second American Revolution Is Happening” – U.S. Intelligence Agencies Have Started A Counter Coup Against Clinton,"Editor’s Note: Is it any wonder that Hillary Clinton is being hit from all sides? The tens of thousands of leaked emails, the re-opening of the FBI investigation, and overwhelming support by military officers for Donald Trump suggest that those working for the military, law enforcement and the intelligence community will do whatever they can to keep Hillary Clinton from becoming their new boss. 

Former United States Department of State official Dr. Steve Pieczenik is a psychiatrist who has over 20 years experience in resolving international crises for four U.S. administrations.
Pieczenik was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance, and James Baker. His expertise includes foreign policy, international crisis management, and psychological warfare. He served the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the capacity of deputy assistant secretary.
He has come forward with a series of videos that expose the Clintons, explains that they co-opted many central facets of our government including the White House, the judiciary, the CIA, and the FBI. and claims that the corrupt couple belongs to a high-level pedophile ring.
Pieczenik explains that it was not the Russians who provided information to WikiLeaks – US intelligence offered the data to Julian Assange. This counter-coup is working against Hillary Clinton and her campaign.

Here, Pieczenik discusses the Clintons’ connections to Anthony Weiner , Jeffrey Esptein’s Lolita Express, and more.

In this video, Pieczenik reveals the details regarding Democratic Party ‘Fixer,” Jeff Rovin.

[“We are on track if we do nothing over the next ten years  —   doing nothing, passing no laws  —   we will borrow nine trillion dollars,” said MacGuineas on Tuesday’s show. She also pointed out that as of now, Trump’s current plans based upon his campaign rhetoric would add another five trillion dollars to the deficit.  “Our debt is already at record levels,” she added. “It’s about   percent of GDP, and we will borrow another nine trillion dollars because of automatic spending growth. ” MacGuineas said, “Not many people notice, but the single   part of the budget is interest on the debt. ” “If we do nothing, at some point, we’ll have a debt crisis,” she added, discussing the ramifications at length.

21257,Police Seize $1 Million of Super Drug from Home,"Pennsylvania State Police raided the home of Kerri Malloy on Wednesday after postal workers notified them of a delivered package that contained carfentanil, CBS Pittsburgh reported. [Carfentanil, a tranquilizer designed to put down   elephants, is 10, 000 times more potent than morphine and is 100 times more potent than fentanyl. A dose of carfentanil the size of a grain of sand is considered a lethal dose for a human being.  “It’s so dangerous that while our people are gathering evidence they have to be in full suits that you would see for the clandestine team,” said Public Relations Officer Stephen Limani. State police indicated that the 5 grams of carfentanil seized are enough to make 50, 000 stamp bags of heroin. At $20 per stamp bag, Limani said that 5 grams of carfentanil are enough to create $1 million of the product. “I would be shocked if this delivery did not end up killing a large quantity of people in our area,” Trooper Limani told reporters. In addition to the carfentanil, police also discovered a grow operation of 136 marijuana plants. Police confirmed that child and youth services are also involved in the case because a child was among those living in the home.

21260,Breitbart Exposed White House Visitor Logs as a Transparency Con - Breitbart,"Critics are blasting President Donald Trump for ending an   policy of releasing White House visitor logs on Friday. [The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for example, called the move “the latest in a series of efforts by President Trump to avoid public accountability. ”  In reality, the White House visitor logs rarely informed the public of anything. They were a fig leaf that let the Obama administration claim transparency while hiding its real operations. (Update: Moreover, the Obama administration went to court to resist releasing the visitor logs, at least initially.) Andrew Breitbart was the first to catch onto President Barack Obama’s con game. In March 2011, he posted an essay  —   at the Huffington Post, no less  —   titled: “The White House Guess List: How Obama Pulled a Fast One on the American People  —   in the Name of ‘Transparency. ’” Breitbart pointed out that “the visitor logs may hide more than they reveal”: The White House is still holding back “tens of thousands” of visitor logs, according to congressional testimony last week by Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, who also added that “the Obama administration is less transparent than the Bush administration. ” We also know that some of the most important presidential visitors don’t even walk into the White House. The administration meets K Street lobbyists at Caribou Coffee, and holds secret meetings in Jackson Place townhouses  where there are no visitor logs. The visitor logs that have been released are problematic, because they are simply lists of names, with no way to verify whether a specific name belongs to a particular person.   …     With no way to verify, there is no real transparency. The visitor logs were a key part of President Barack Obama’s claim to have run “the most transparent administration in history. ” But in every other way, he was one of the least transparent presidents in the   era. Obama “set a record” for failing to comply with Freedom of Access to Information Act requests, among other   sins. Obama’s visitor logs were no deterrent to the crooked and malevolent. Logs revealed that   activist Robert Creamer, a convicted felon and the man behind an effort to instigate violence at Trump campaign events, visited the White House some 340 times, with 45 visits including the president himself. The media never cared, nor did he. Arguably, two wrongs don’t make a right. The fact that the Trump administration took advantage of the Good Friday holiday to announce the policy change might suggest some degree of moral doubt. Yet the fact is that visitor logs were never a useful tool to enforcing executive transparency. Better tools are needed, and it is foolish to pretend otherwise. Joel B.

21261,German Local Authorities Halt Pro-Erdogan Islamist Rallies,"BERLIN (AFP)  —   German local authorities on Thursday blocked rallies by Turkish ministers aimed at promoting a referendum that would expand President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s powers, citing capacity problems. [The Union of European Turkish Democrats had been due to hold one rally later Thursday in the western town of Gaggenau, with Turkey’s Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag as the guest speaker.  But Gaggenau authorities withdrew an earlier agreement for the group to rent a hall for the event, saying it did not have the capacity to host so many people. “Because the event is now known across the region, the city expects a large number of visitors. However, the Bad Rotenfels hall, parking lots and access road are insufficient to meet that demand,” the town’s authorities said in a statement. “Due to these reasons, the hall rental agreement with the UETD has been revoked,” it added. Separately, Cologne city authorities said they would no longer allow the UETD to use a hall on Sunday, when Turkish Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci is expected to make a rally speech. “The event can and will not happen there,” a spokeswoman for Cologne city authorities told AFP. It was unclear if Zeybekci would be able to find an alternative site. The UETD had earlier reserved a room in the city hall of the   district for a “theatre event” said the spokeswoman. But on Wednesday, the group said it would now host an “information event”. The city said however that it would no longer make the site available to the group, citing difficulties in guaranteeing security at such short notice. Turkish politicians including Prime Minister Binali Yildirim have sparked controversy over their visits to Germany to hold political rallies. Germany is home to about three million people of Turkish origin, the legacy of a massive “guest worker” programme in the 1960s and 70s and the biggest population of Turks in the world outside of Turkey. And Erdogan’s government is keen to harness their votes for the April 16 referendum, which would discard the post of prime minister for the first time in Turkey’s history. Critics say the new presidential system will cement   rule in the country.   relations have been strained by a series of disputes since the failed coup that aimed to oust Erdogan last July. The latest issue dogging ties is Ankara’s provisional detention of a German journalist on   charges. Deniz Yucel, 43, a correspondent of the German newspaper Die Welt, has been held since February 18 in connection with news reports on an attack by hackers against the email account of Turkey’s energy minister. Berlin’s sharp criticism of Ankara’s massive crackdown after the failed putsch has also irked Turkey.",0
21264,"Jackie Mason Rips Congress: No Time for Health Care and Tax Reform Votes, But Plenty of Time for Fundraisers - Breitbart","In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason. [In this week’s exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie questions why lawmakers can’t seem to get the three things Americans want most  —   health care, tax reform and the continuing resolution  —   passed once and for all.  “I could see where it’s impossible to climb two mountains at the same time, or drive two cars at the same time, or dance with two elephants at the same time,” Jackie says. “But you can’t pass three resolutions at the same time? How long does it take?” “Let’s assume somebody said it was a fundraiser, are you coming? Yes or no? Would you be able to answer them? What if they told you there’s two fundraisers, or four fundraisers?” Jackie challenges. “Would you say you have no time to do all of them? You would have time to do ten thousand of them. But as soon as a vote is involved, which takes a second, you have no time. ” Jackie also wonders about the qualifications needed to become a congressman. “If you want to become a barber, you know there’s a state test to become a barber? In other words, in this country, they protect you from a bad haircut, but if you want to run the country, they’ll take any schmuck in the world,” he says. “Even a plumber has to take a state test,” he adds. “Why do you think the toilets in this country are working perfectly, but the government is full of  …     you know what I’m talking about. ” Sadly, Jackie says things will never change because lawmakers make the same amount of money whether the country is running or not. And despite all the fear of a government shutdown, Jackie thinks it could actually be a good thing. Check out the video above to see why.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
21269,DHS Authorizes Hiring 10K Immigration Officers,"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John F. Kelly authorized the hiring of an additional 10, 000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and enforcement officers. The move by DHS delivers on a promise made by President Donald Trump to increase enforcement —  particularly in removing criminal aliens inside the borders of the U. S.[Secretary Kelly ordered the director of ICE to immediately begin the process of hiring 10, 000 to effectively enforce the immigration laws in the interior regions of the U. S. according to a DHS memo obtained by Breitbart Texas. In addition, Kelly authorized the agency to hire additional operational and mission support staff, along with legal staff.  Kelly said the memo implements the Executive Order, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” issued by President Trump on January 25. ICE agents and enforcement officers were used earlier this month to conduct a targeted roundup of criminal aliens in metropolitan areas across the country. Agents and officers arrested more than 600 criminal aliens in 11 states, Breitbart Texas reported. The operation spawned a rash of “fake news” reports, tweets, and other social media comments that sparked unnecessary fear among immigrants not in the sights of the targeted operation. “I believe ICE is out in public arresting people in order to retaliate against our community for standing up for our values against people like Abbott and Trump,” Austin City Councilman Casar posted on Facebook. “Trump and his allies will do everything they can to divide Americans, invoke fear in vulnerable neighborhoods, and demonize an entire community of people. ” “Of those [680 aliens] arrested, approximately 75 percent were criminal aliens, convicted of crimes including, but not limited to, homicide, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual assault of a minor, lewd and lascivious acts with a child, indecent liberties with a minor, drug trafficking, battery, assault, DUI and weapons charges,” Secretary Kelly wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. ICE enforcement officers routinely execute targeted enforcement operations to remove violent criminal aliens from the country. The additional 10, 000 agents and officers will allow the DHS to more efficiently carry out its mission of enforcing immigration laws in the interior of the country. Some of the operations conducted in the past include (according to DHS statistics): The memorandum from Secretary Kelly is effective immediately.

21271,Michigan Allots $87 Million to Replace Flint’s Tainted Water Pipes - The New York Times,"The State of Michigan has agreed to spend $87 million in a proposed settlement to replace thousands of lead pipes throughout Flint over the next three years, the latest effort by state and city officials to fix the contaminated water system. The state may use a combination of federal and state funds for the project, which, if approved, would settle a lawsuit brought last year by a coalition of Flint residents and national groups. The suit blamed city and state officials for failing to protect residents from drinking   water for more than a year. A federal judge is expected to review the agreement during a hearing in Detroit on Tuesday. The proposed deal also calls for the state to provide free bottled water and to conduct extensive testing of Flint’s tap water for lead in the coming months. By January 2020, the agreement says, the city will have replaced pipes in and around thousands of homes  —   perhaps 18, 000 of them  —   speeding up a project that began last year to replace corroded lead pipes. Pipes made of lead or galvanized steel are expected to be replaced with copper. “This proposed agreement is a win for the people of Flint,” said Dimple Chaudhary, a lawyer for the National Resources Defense Council. “It provides a comprehensive framework to address lead contamination in Flint’s tap water. The agreement is a significant step forward for the Flint community, covering a number of critical issues related to water safety. ” The lawsuit was filed against Michigan and Flint officials in January 2016 by a group including the Natural Resources Defense Council the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan Concerned Pastors for Social Action and Melissa Mays, a Flint resident. The group asserted that the state and the city were in violation of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Ari Adler, a spokesman for Gov. Rick Snyder, said he could not comment because the agreement was still under mediation. Under the terms of the deal, residents are entitled to lead testing of their water four times a year. Residents who are homebound may receive deliveries of bottled water, and nine distribution centers will offer free bottled water, filters and replacement cartridges for filters. Teams dispatched by the city will inspect water filters on faucets, ensure that they are installed correctly and explain proper use to residents, a step to further educate people in Flint about lead contamination. In April 2014, Flint officials switched the city’s water source from Detroit’s water system to the Flint River, and residents immediately began to report health problems, water discoloration and foul smells from their faucets. It took more than a year before state officials publicly acknowledged the problem. Experts said that water from the Flint River had corroded the pipes and caused lead to leach into the water. Jacob D. Abernethy, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, collaborated with Flint officials on a study last year that analyzed the water system and the undertaking to replace lead pipes in homes. He said that finishing the replacement in three years seemed possible with enough money and resources. The pipe replacement in Flint did not begin as quickly as officials had initially hoped. “It’s been a slow project for a lot of reasons,” Mr. Abernethy said. “There’s a lot of hurdles in the way: The City Council has to approve the locations. Every time you want to go to a home, you have to get approval from the homeowner. Contractors encounter problems they didn’t expect to find. ” But after months of construction, he said, officials in Flint “have figured out how to make this thing go fast. ”",0
21274,Now is the Best Time to Start Seeds For Spring,"Leeks 

Vegetables that do not like to be disturbed include many of the root vegetable varieties such as Carrots, Beets, Turnips, and Parsnips. Many of the root vegetables are cold-hearty and can withstand colder temperatures, and therefore be directly planted in the ground as soon as temperatures are above 39 F for the season. Several vegetables that are a bit trickier include corn, beans, and peas. These vegetables have a much more sensitive root system and do well when they are directly planted into the ground once the season has come, after the last frost when temperatures begin to warm and sunlight increases. 

When your seedlings have matured enough and the temperature outside is warming, it is time to start thinking about getting your vegetables outside and into the garden. This typically happens after the last frost, when the outdoor temperature is above 59 F. If nighttime temperatures drop a lot lower than this, wait another week or two. 

Cold weather can rot seedlings and shock them, even killing tender crops. Once you are confident that temperatures and weather outside is optimal, begin to harden your seedlings and prep them for transplanting. 

To do this, place your seedlings outside in a shaded area with filtered light and slowly, over the course of a week, expose them to more and more sunlight. Seedlings grown indoors are usually quite fragile and soft, and need time to harden before being planted outside in the ground. 

Once your seedlings have been planted in the ground, ensure that they are watered immediately. Some may droop or wilt as a result of being transplanted, but most will rebound after they have had time to adjust to their move. Be sure not to over water new transplants because they will be unable to use all the moisture around them and soon rot. 

Starting seedlings inside will give you a fun activity to do indoors and your garden will thank you in spring!

21279,"Girl Asks Her 20 Boyfriends To Each Give Her an iPhone, Uses The Money To Buy a House","Many Women Suffer From Fungal Infections And They Can Cure Them At Home Ξ [November 1, 2016] BLOG Girl Asks Her 20 Boyfriends To Each Give Her an iPhone, Uses The Money To Buy a House posted by Eddie We have heard the stories about Apple fanatics selling body parts and changing their passport in order to get the latest products from the company , but this latest story coming from China gives a different perspective on how you can use Apple devices as a tool. As a rather strange tool, in fact: an entrepreneurial Chinese woman is said to have convinced 20 men that she has been dating to buy her iPhones, which she would then sell and use the money as a downpayment for a house. The purchase of a house is probably the single biggest one-time spending in the lifetime of a person, and it could take long years of hard work, so it is indeed remarkable that the woman found the quick way to get there (however, not the most ethical one, arguably). Let’s make it clear: the story seems to have started on local Tian Ya Yi Du forum, where someone by the nickname Proud Qiaoba told the story of how her co-worker Xiaoli (not her real name) asked each of her 20 current boyfriends to buy her the new iPhone 7. How in the world is it possible to simulatenously date 20 people remains a mystery that gives this whole story a bit of a fairy tale aura, but knowing that China suffers from a terrible male-to-female ratio let’s assume that is somehow possible. Xiaoli, whose life remains veiled in secrecy, then sold all of the phones to a suspiciously particular place: mobile phone recycling site Hui Shou Bao, all for a total of 120,000 Chinese yuan, the equivalent of around $17,500. The woman then used the cash for a downpayment towards a countryhouse home. Xiaoli broke the news when she invited her co-workers for a house warming party. “Everyone in the office is talking about this now. Who knows what her boyfriends think now this news has become public.” From Qiaoba we also learn that Xiaoli “is not from a wealthy family. Her mum is a housewife and her dad is a migrant worker, and she is the oldest daughter. Her parents are getting old and she might be under a lot pressure hoping to buy them a house… But it’s still unbelievable that she could use this method!” 
It does indeed sound quite fantastical and made-up, and some have theorized that it’s all just a theory to popularize the local Hui Shou Bao phone re-seller (the company has confirmed that it had indeed sold 20 iPhones from a single person recently). Meanwhile, the whole story quickly started becoming popular in China: a ’20 mobiles for a house’ hashtag went trending on local microblog Weibo and has been used more than 13 million times. Reaction sway from admiration for Xiaoli’s boyfriend-getting and management skills to sheer awe and condemnation of her actions. Whatever it is, Xiaoli – if she even exists – is now said to shy away from the public eye and to refuse interviews from media. That’s actually not surprising… those 20 boyfriends surely would not be happy about her actions. Source:",0
21280,Massive Spike In Obamacare Health Premiums Could Boost Trump To Victory,"Trump Says He Will Sign Very First Bill to Repeal Obamacare 
“This is ready-made advertising for Republican candidates to use nationwide,” stated Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. “If you’re a Republican candidate, it would be malpractice not to talk about it, highlight it or advertise on it.” 
To be sure, Trump has been hitting the issue hard over the past several days, mentioning the rate hikes at four separate rally appearances in a 24-hour period this week. 
“ Repealing Obamacare and stopping Hillary’s healthcare takeover is one of the single most important reasons that we must win on Nov. 8,” Trump told rally-goers Tuesday afternoon in Sanford, Florida. Advertisement - story continues below 
Other Republicans have been quick to jump on the issue as well, including vulnerable incumbent GOP senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Roy Blunt of Missouri. 
Should these Republican senators and others maintain a focus on Obamacare during the final two weeks, they stand a good chance of fending off the Democrat effort to wrench control of the Senate away from the GOP. 
The same applies to Trump, should he refrain from media distractions and continue harping on the failures of Obama and his health care law, particularly in hard-hit swing states like Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, to name just a few. 
And he will have Obama to thank personally for paving the way to a Trump presidency through his horribly flawed Obamacare law. Advertisement - story continues below",0
21281,"Ossoff Campaign Told Volunteers to Say ’He Lives Three Blocks Away from the District,’ Reporter Shows Distance Is Three Miles","It has been reported for several months that Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate seeking to win the special election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District on Tuesday, does not live in the district. [Last month, an Ossoff campaign worker told volunteer canvassers that if asked about their candidate’s residence, they should say that “he lives three blocks from the district. ”  (Beginning at the 55 second mark in this YouTube video, the Ossoff campaign worker says, “This falls into the category of if you don’t know, you can say I don’t know. But, yeah, I mean, he lives three blocks away from the district. ”) Brent Scher, an intrepid reporter for the Washington Free Beacon, put that Ossoff campaign claim to the test on Monday, and discovered that the actual distance from Ossoff’s residence to the Sixth Congressional District is three miles rather than three blocks: I set out to walk from Ossoff’s current residence in the northwest corner of Emory University to a section of the sixth district (outlined in green in the below screenshot) that juts down into the fifth district on Buford Highway. It would have been a shorter trip, by the way, to Georgia’s Fourth Congressional District, but that’s not where Ossoff is running. I drew myself my own little map, knowing that my phone would be taxed by my attempt to put the entire quest on Facebook Live, and set out at 10:32 a. m. for the International Cafe, which I determined to be the closest landmark inside the sixth district. I documented the early parts of my journey in the above video, but eventually the treacherous conditions of the long walk were too much for my Motorola Droid Turbo to handle. Shortly after my attempts to Facebook Live crashed and burned, my entire phone followed suit. Scher says he arrived at the International Cafe, “the closest landmark inside the sixth district,” after walking for about two hours. He took an Uber back to where he had parked his car to begin his walk. “My Uber from the International Cafe back to my car, which was parked by Ossoff’s place, was 6. 55 miles and took 18 minutes and 45 seconds. My walk was about 3. 2 miles,” Scher wrote. “A lot longer than 3 blocks,” Scher concluded. The outcome of Tuesday’s election between Ossoff and Karen Handel, the Republican candidate, remains too close to call.",0
21282,Japanese troops deploy to South Sudan risking first overseas conflict since World War 2,"Japanese troops deploy to South Sudan risking first overseas conflict since World War 2 The move risks pulling the troops into conflict for the first time in more than seven decades By Michael Krieger - 11.21.2016 @1:18 PM EST 
The re-miliarization of Japan has been on my radar and caused me much concern in recent years. I’ve covered the topic on several occasions, with the most recent example published over the summer in the post, Japanese Government Shifts Further Toward Authoritarianism and Militarism . Here are the first few paragraphs: One of the most discomforting aspects of Neil Howe and William Strauss’ seminal work on generational cycles, The Fourth Turning (1997), is the fact that as far as American history is concerned, they all climax and end with massive wars. To be more specific, the first “fourth turning” in American history culminated with the Revolutionary War (1775-1783), the second culminated with the Civil War (1861-1865), while the third ended with the bloodiest war in world history, World War II (1939-1945). The number of years between the end of the Revolutionary War and the start of the Civil War was 78 years, and the number of years between the end of the Civil War and the start of World War II was 74 years (76 years if you use America’s entry into the war as your starting date). Therefore, if Howe & Strauss’ theory holds any water, and I think it does, we’re due for a major conflict somewhere around 75 years from the end of World War II. That brings us to 2020. The more I look around, the more signs appear everywhere that the world is headed into another major conflict. From an unnecessary resurgence of a Cold War with Russia, to increased tensions in the South China Sea and complete chaos and destruction in the Middle East, the world is a gigantic tinderbox. All it will take to transform these already existing conflict zones into a major conflagration is another severe global economic downturn, something I fully expect to happen within the next 1-2 years. Frighteningly, this puts on a perfect collision course with the 2020 area. 
Although I felt World War 3 was a virtual lock under Hillary Clinton, the election of Trump does not negate historical cycles or current geopolitical trends, and the world continues to move in a very dangerous direction. 
While the below snippet from a Reuters article published today may not seem like a big deal, it’s just a small part of a much larger trend. 
Via Reuters : A contingent of Japanese troops landed in South Sudan on Monday, an official said – a mission that critics say could see them embroiled in their country’s first overseas fighting since World War Two. The soldiers will join U.N. peacekeepers and help build infrastructure in the landlocked and impoverished country torn apart by years of civil war. But, under new powers granted by their government last year, they will be allowed to respond to urgent calls for help from U.N. staff and aid workers. There are also plans to let them guard U.N. bases, which have been attacked during the fighting. The deployment of 350 soldiers is in line with Japanese security legislation to expand the military’s role overseas. Critics in Japan have said the move risks pulling the troops into conflict for the first time in more than seven decades. 
All it would take is a sharp global economic downturn to push world “leaders” towards overseas conflict in order to distract from problems at home. The risk is very real.",0
21283,Donald Trump Rescued From Stalled Elevator in Colorado Springs - The New York Times,"COLORADO SPRINGS  —   The Colorado Springs Fire Department said that Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, had to be rescued from an elevator that was stuck between the first and second floors of a resort. In a statement released on Saturday, the department said that it was called at 1:30 p. m. on Friday to rescue about 10 people, including Mr. Trump, who were trapped inside the elevator at The Mining Exchange, a Wyndham Grand Hotel and Spa resort. The department said the firefighters opened the top elevator hatch and lowered a ladder into the elevator. Mr. Trump and the others used the ladder to climb out of the elevator to the second floor. The department said no injuries were reported. The Trump campaign confirmed that the incident occurred but did not provide details. During a rally on Friday at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Mr. Trump criticized the city’s fire marshal for limiting the number of people allowed to attend his speech at the building where the event was held. Fire Marshal Brett Lacey told the Colorado Springs Gazette that he had already agreed to allow a 10 percent increase in seating at the venue.",0
21284,Prosecutors Say Trump Tower Climber Wanted Publicity - The New York Times,"The man who scaled Trump Tower last week told investigators he did so for “the publicity,” which he hoped would earn him a meeting with Donald J. Trump, Manhattan prosecutors said in court on Wednesday. Prosecutors said the man, Stephen Rogata, 19, made the statement after he was detained for the Aug. 10 stunt. It turned into an international spectacle, streamed over social media and broadcast by television news. Mr. Rogata appeared in Criminal Court through a video link to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he has been under psychiatric care since the episode. Wearing a pale blue hospital outfit, his brown hair covering most of his face, Mr. Rogata sat quietly as prosecutors read the charges, including reckless endangerment and criminal trespassing. Judge Kevin McGrath set bail at $10, 000 cash or $5, 000 bond. Prosecutors said Mr. Rogata, who lives in Virginia, walked into the Midtown tower’s atrium, sneaked into a   area and began his climb of the building’s exterior on the fifth floor. Mr. Rogata had been scaling the building for nearly three hours when he was grabbed by officers who had removed a window on the 21st floor. The climb, which was watched by millions of viewers on television and online, as well as hundreds of people from the streets below, was the latest   chapter for Trump Tower, since Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign there last summer. On Wednesday, Pierre Griffith, an assistant district attorney, said that Mr. Rogata told investigators he had wanted to give Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, “secret information” that “has to do with when he’s president, how he’s going to govern. ” Prosecutors said Mr. Rogata told investigators that he had hoped to make it to the top of the   building but also knew he would quite likely be arrested. Mr. Rogata, prosecutors said, waited for his parents to leave home before driving to New York City, where he arrived on Aug. 9. He bought climbing equipment online in the weeks before the stunt and practiced on a   building in Virginia, Mr. Griffith said. Mr. Griffith asked the judge for a $20, 000 bail, saying several items fell out of Mr. Rogata’s backpack as he climbed, including a laptop computer. “This defendant’s crime endangered not only himself and people beneath him,” but also emergency responders, he said. But Judge McGrath lowered the amount after being petitioned by Mr. Rogata’s lawyer, Tara Collins of the Legal Aid Society. Ms. Collins said Mr. Rogata had been receiving psychiatric treatment at Bellevue. She described him as a good student  —   a member of the debate and the cross country teams in high school  —   who volunteered for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. He works at a plant nursery, she said. She described Mr. Rogata’s father as a “ ” officer in the Navy with a specialty in flight navigation, and said both of his parents had visited him at the hospital. Mr. Rogata, she said, “did something that was profoundly stupid with hopes of meeting someone who he will never get to meet. ”",0
21285,Boxing Judges and Refs Removed After Suspicious Results - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Several referees and judges have been removed from the Olympic boxing competition after officials reviewed their decisions, fueling suspicion of dubious results in some matches at the Rio Games. A spokesman for the federation that governs the boxing tournament said Wednesday that the names of the referees and judges who were dismissed, and the matches that were tainted, would not be released because he did not want to “besmirch their families. ” The international federation, known as AIBA, said in a statement that the committee that reviews officiating had assessed all 239 bouts at the Rio Games through Tuesday and had “determined that less than a handful of the decisions were not at the level expected. ” The federation statement also said that “the concerned referees and judges will no longer officiate at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. ” The move came a day after Michael Conlan, an Irish bantamweight, accused the federation of corruption and suggested that Russian boxing officials had bribed judges. Conlan’s accusations came in an   tirade after he lost his quarterfinal to Vladimir Nikitin of Russia. Nikitin won a unanimous decision, but the public response to the verdict suggested that many observers believed Conlan should have won. The judges’ decision in the   fight was not the first at the Rio Games to draw scrutiny. On Monday, the crowd jeered when another Russian fighter, Evgeny Tishchenko, was awarded a unanimous decision over Vassiliy Levit of Kazakhstan, who appeared to have won the bout handily. Two of the three judges who scored Conlan’s bout  —   Jones Kennedy Silva do Rosario of Brazil and Udeni Talik Bandara Kiridena of Sri Lanka  —   returned to officiate on Wednesday. All three judges had scored the fight   in favor of Nikitin. The judges of the   fight, the heavyweight gold medal match, were also unanimous in their decision. Only one of them, however, made a repeat appearance. Armando Carbonell Alvarado of Colombia judged two fights Wednesday, while Michael Gallagher of Ireland and Kheira Sidi Yakoub of Algeria judged none. The boxing federation did not say how many decisions it deemed insufficient, and it did not specify what was wrong with those decisions. None of the decisions will be overturned, AIBA said. Coaches at the boxing venue Wednesday said that the scoring system left a lot of room for interpretation and that the judges, although well trained, were not infallible. They also expressed relief that the issue of inadequate judging was being addressed, although they dismissed the accusations of corruption. “I’m glad some action was taken,” said Billy Walsh, a coach of the United States team. “Anybody can make a mistake, but it’s happened too often. ” Kay Koroma, who also coaches the Americans, said, “I don’t think it’s corruption it’s just bad decision making. ” AIBA invited people with evidence about bribing judges to step forward. “With regard to corruption, we would like to strongly restate that unless tangible proof is put forward, not rumors, we will continue to use any means, including legal or disciplinary actions, to protect our sport” and the referees and judges “whose integrity is constantly put into question,” the federation’s statement said. The federation chooses from 36 judges and referees at the Rio Games. AIBA picks five judges to work each bout and prohibits judges from a fighter’s country, or from a country in conflict with a fighter’s country, from working a bout. After each fight, a computer program randomly determines which three of the five judges’ scorecards will be counted. The other two scorecards are thrown out. Still, questions about judging will continue. “If they really prove that there was some kind of corruption, it is really very sad, but for now there’s no proof of anything, only rumors,” said Mateus Alves, a Brazilian coach.",0
21286,In Just 11 Days Scientists Destroyed Breast Cancer Tumors Without Chemo,"Share on Facebook Research presented by Professor Nigel Bundred at the European Breast Cancer Conference in Amsterdam revealed that they had tested the effectiveness of a pair of drugs known as Herceptin (a.k.a trastuzumab) and Lapatinib. The two drugs are commonly used in breast cancer treatment already, but this is the first time they had been combined together and used before surgery and chemotherapy. What they found was they were able to eliminate some types of breast cancer in just 11 days. Funded by Cancer Research UK, they aimed to use these drugs to combat a protein called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) which affects the growth and division of cancer cells . It's also more likely to return than other cancer types. What also makes this treatment so appealing is the fact that it eliminates the need for chemotherapy and surgery. The temporary side effects like hair loss, vomiting and fatigue are also avoided, making treatment less impactful on the body. Chemo is not entirely effective, nor is it the right choice for a lot of patients, so any alternatives are welcomed. Study Results 257 women with HER2 positive breast cancer were selected for the study, with half being put on the drug combo and the other half were the control group. What they found was that of those on the drug, 11% had no cancer cells remaining within two weeks and 17% of cases featured dramatically shrunken tumors . Compared to the control group who were only given Herceptin, they were found to have 0% with no trace of cancer cells and only 3% showed a drop in tumor size. Clearly, the two drugs combined have a major effect on breast cancer cells as opposed to being used on their own. The problem currently, however, is that Herceptin's licensing makes it only available for use alongside chemotherapy and not alone. The results of this study may help to change that though. Although there's still a lot of work to be done, hopefully, this is a major step in the fight against one of the world's deadliest diseases. With medical advancements improving every year, it's entirely possible this could happen sooner than we think!",0
21287,Marco Rubio Inches Closer To Unemployment As Poll Shows Florida Senate Race Tie,"A PPP poll of Florida found: 
Candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in Florida. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by four points (48/44), and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy is tied with Republican incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, 46/46. By an almost two to-one margin, 51/26, Florida voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate for U.S. Senate who supports strengthening gun laws, suggesting ample room for growth for gun safety candidates before the election next month. 
The poll was conducted by PPP the Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, and it illustrates the dilemma that the Florida Senate race has created for Democrats. Democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive Florida media, but there are polls that suggest that Sen. Marco Rubio’s Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy, has a chance of winning the seat. 
If Rep. Murphy can beat Sen. Rubio, the defeat would likely put an end to Rubio’s national political career or at least force the Florida Republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in 2020, and instead focus on a run for governor. 
Democrats have a real chance to send Marco Rubio to the unemployment line. Rubio has been a disinterested Senator, who just like Ted Cruz, seems only interest in his Senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions. Rubio has provided poor service to his constituents , and doesn’t deserve to return to the US Senate. 
Sen. Rubio has refused to commit to serving his full Senate term, which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them. 
Democrats have a chance to solidify their potential Senate majority by sending Marco Rubio home. With cash to spend and less than two weeks left in the campaign, they’d be foolish not to take it.

21291,Marvel Abandons Fan Base: Un-American ‘Captain America’ on 24/7 Anti-Trump Rant,"From actor Chris Evans (Captain America) to director Joss Whedon, the Marvel Comics franchise is committing harikari in the most unbecoming of ways: through unapologetic, partisan bashing of a democratically elected president they can’t stand. [Evans has expressed deep contempt for what he considers to be in the ignorant masses of Americans that voted Donald Trump into the White House. These are, however, the very masses that make up the core viewership of Marvel’s superhero movies.  “People were just so desperate to hear someone say that someone is to blame,” Evans said in a recent interview with Esquire magazine. “They were just so happy to hear that someone was angry, hear someone say that Washington sucks. ” “I feel rage,” he said. “I feel fury. It’s unbelievable. ” “They just want something new without actually understanding,” he continued. “I mean, guys like Steve Bannon  —   Steve Bannon!  —   this man has no place in politics. ” Evans’ trolling of Trump on Twitter seems more an obsession than a pastime, and the actor seems to blame the President for all of the country’s woes. They did not die because of you. They died because of a hateful, ignorant, pathetic, EMBOLDENED piece of trash. https:  .   —   Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) May 29, 2017,  Unacceptable. This man disgusts me. If you dont think Trump has played a role in this unapologetic wave of ignorance and hate, you are WRONG https:  .   —   Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) May 15, 2017,  This administration LOVES to distract. This will only make it harder for women to stay healthy. Government $ can’t be spent on abortions! https:  .   —   Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) April 14, 2017,  Of course, no one expects Hollywood actors to be intellectually sophisticated, but to have them try to infect Americans with their own ignorant bigotry is really a bridge too far. In large part, the bizarre rants the Marvel folks carry out on Twitter and elsewhere are abortion driven. Spitting in the face of their conservative fan base that is overwhelmingly   Whedon and Evans, along with other Marvel stars such as Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) fawn over Planned Parenthood while painting abortion foes as backward and unenlightened. “As most of you know, Planned Parenthood has been under attack for many years now for another service they thankfully offer, providing a safe place for legal abortions,” Johansson said during a Variety luncheon last year. “A woman’s right to choose what to do with her body shouldn’t just be a woman’s rights issue. It’s the year 2016, and this is a human rights issue. ” Whedon recently went so far as to produce a short video panegyric to Planned Parenthood, calling America’s largest abortion provider a “beacon of hope” for the nation, while imagining how horrible life would be without Planned Parenthood to eliminate the unintended consequences of sexual libertinism. Why actors and filmmakers feel an irresistible urge to allow partisan politics to get in the way of their craft is a mystery, but whatever their motives such unrestraint often has consequences. It’s only a matter of time before Marvel’s fan base calls them out for their hypocrisy.     are not what patriots pay to see. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome",0

After her answer Todd again said, “You did not answer the question. Why did the president send out his press secretary who is not just the spokesperson for Donald Trump, he is also the spokesperson for all of America at times. He speaks for all of the country at times, why put him out there for the very first time in front of that podium to utter a provable falsehood? It’s a small thing, but the first time he confronts the public it’s a falsehood. ” Conway said  “Chuck, if we’re going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms, I think we are going to have to rethink our relationship here.

21301,"After Plagiarism Reports, Monica Crowley Won’t Take White House Job - The New York Times","Monica Crowley, who was selected just weeks ago to serve in a   post on   Donald J. Trump’s National Security Council, has decided against taking the position after allegations that she plagiarized key passages in a 2012 book. Ms. Crowley, whose name was briefly floated as a candidate for White House press secretary, has been dogged by accusations of plagiarism in recent weeks, beginning with the discovery by CNN that she copied several passages in a book she published with HarperCollins. A later report in Politico unearthed similar issues in her doctoral dissertation. “After much reflection, I have decided to remain in New York to pursue other opportunities and will not be taking a position in the incoming administration,” Ms. Crowley said in a statement to The Washington Times. “I greatly appreciate being asked to be part of   Trump’s team, and I will continue to enthusiastically support him and his agenda for American renewal,” she said. She did not address the allegations of plagiarism. Ms. Crowley is the second official announced by the transition team to decide not to go to the White House, following Jason Miller, who was to be the communications director. One person close to the transition said that Ms. Crowley’s role would have involved overseeing certain speeches, something that would have been difficult after the plagiarism claims. HarperCollins has withdrawn the digital edition of Ms. Crowley’s book “What the (Bleep) Just Happened?” Published by Broadside Books, a conservative imprint at HarperCollins, it is a critical look at Barack Obama’s presidency. It sold out 20, 000 copies in hardcover, Publishers Marketplace said. Mr. Trump’s transition team had labeled the plagiarism reports “a politically motivated attack” and defended Ms. Crowley’s ability to serve. “Monica’s exceptional insight and thoughtful work on how to turn this country around is exactly why she will be serving in the administration,” transition officials said in a statement to CNN. “HarperCollins  —   one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world  —   published her book, which has become a national best seller,” the statement said. “Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country. ” Most publishers do not check for plagiarism, fabrication or factual inaccuracies.",0
21304,War on the Streets of Paris: Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital,"War on the Streets of Paris: Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital Nick Gutteridge, Express, November 2, 2016 
A migrant turf war erupted into violence on the streets of one of Paris’ trendiest neighbourhoods early this morning as asylum seekers beat each other to a pulp with wooden clubs. 
The area around Stalingrad Metro station was turned into a refugee battleground as rival gangs of migrants set upon each other in shocking scenes of violence. 
Asylum seekers wearing hooded tops wielded makeshift clubs fashioned from lengths of wood which they used to bludgeon each other as horrified pedestrians looked on. 
The blood-curdling brawl erupted just yards from the Stalingrad Metro station, where a squalid migrant camp has popped up following the demolition of the Jungle. 
It was not immediately clear what sparked the early morning fight, but rival gangs of people smugglers have previously been involved in violent brawls in Calais. 
And despite the horrific brawl, a pro-migrant rally is apparently being organised to take place at the camp at 6pm tonight. 
The once peaceful neighbourhood, in Paris’ 10th Arrondissement, used to be a popular area with tourists, boasting a lively nightlife scene bustling with restaurants and bars. 
But worried residents have revealed how it has become a no go zone in recent weeks following the establishment of the refugee camp, which has brought squalor and violence. 
Thousands of migrants–mostly from Sudan, Libya, Afghanistan, and Eritrea–have pitched tents under the Metro station after the demolition of the Jungle hampered their attempts to reach Britain. 
French police have tried and failed on many occasions to clear the squalid squat, but asylum seekers simply keep on returning and reestablishing it. 
There are now nore than 2,500 migrants pitching up in the makeshift camp, with locals saying the eyesore is ruining their businesses and making life a “living hell”. 
Residents in the once popular district say that the squatters are now becoming increasingly violent and dangerous, with increased reports of muggings. 
Faisal, a shopkeeper, told the French daily Le Figaro that Stalingrad locals are living in fear, threatening the future of his business. 
He said: “The stench of urine, faeces, and rubbish has made Stalingrad an insalubrious place to live. The place is dead – no-one wants to come here anymore. People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in. 
“I’m making less than €60 (£53) a day. A few more weeks like this and I’ll go bust! 
“French people have been kind to them. I know they’re desperate, but the least they can do is respect the law and try and integrate into French society.” 
Jeanne, another Stalingrad resident, told Le Figaro the migrants had become increasingly violent towards locals. 
She said: “Brazen migrants are snatching jewellery and handbags off passers-by–they’re even stealing bread. I’ve seen them beat people up too.” 
Police have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year, and on Monday French president François Hollande vowed to close the camp for good. 
But within 24 hours of a police operation to move migrants on tents had sprung up again, showing the uphill battle authorities in the French capital face to shut down such illegal encampments. 
Furious locals have demanded that the camp be closed once and for all, describing how they have heard “blood-curdling noises” coming from it in the middle of the night. 
Marie, who lives right next to the makeshift camp, told Le Figaro: “Life here has become unbearable. More than 2,500 squatters were evacuated in September, and now, less than two months later, they’re back. And now that the ‘Jungle’ camp has been closed, things are about to get even worse.” 
Another local, Monique, said that she was at “a loss for words” and “utterly distraught” over the situation. 
She said: “The streets are littered with rubbish and faeces. We can hear blood-curdling screams coming from the camp in the middle of the night.",0

21309,Le Pen Pulling in Support Among Young Voters,"Marine Le Pen is supported by a quarter of young voters in France, a poll has revealed, matching support within the age group for her liberal rival Emmanuel Macron. [The 18 to    age bracket is usually notably liberal and broadly opposed to all expressions of nationalism, including Brexit and the election of U. S. President Donald J. Trump.  Yet in France, some 24 per cent of this group told pollsters they intended to vote for the populist candidate and her Front National party in the first round of the presidential vote on the 24th of August. The young, photogenic centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, who served as economy minister under outgoing president François Hollande, also gained 24 per cent of their support in the Harris Interactive survey for French radio station RTL. Another 19 per cent of those interviewed wanted the   candidate   Mélenchon to win the presidency and 14 per cent said they were rooting for   Benoît Hamon of the Socialist party. This means that Ms. Le Pen is more popular than both   candidates in the first round of voting among young people. In the second round, they will likely unite against her and she will lose. Meanwhile, only 10 per cent of voters aged 18 to 24 said they would be backing the   Republican Party candidate François Fillon, who was the favourite to win before becoming embroiled in a corruption scandal. Furthermore, in a supposed age of political apathy 80 per cent of the 808 people interviewed between the 2nd and 6th of March told pollsters they were “interested” in politics, and were keeping a “keen eye” on the presidential race. However, Ms. Len Pen has stressed her scepticism towards polls during the presidential race, after pollsters failed to predict the Brexit vote or President Trump’s victory. “Polls are not the election” she told RTL on Tuesday.",0
21310,Local Aunt’s 14th New Boyfriend This Year Probably ‘The One’,"0 Add Comment 
SWIRLING rumours in one Waterford homestead suggest that Tramore woman and local aunt Deirdre Collane’s latest boyfriend may be ‘the one’. 
In a dramatic unveiling ceremony, Deirdre is believed to have presented Danny Mondran to her older sister, her brother-in-law and her 4 nieces and nephews and declared they were getting on so well she wouldn’t be surprised if they were married sometime next year in Spain, in a church she definitely hadn’t already picked out. 
Not wanting to speak too soon or ‘jinx it’, Deirdre tentatively suggested Mondran, her 14th boyfriend of the 2016 dating season, was likely to be the one, her future husband and mother of her 5 children named Daniel Jr, Ciara, Colm, Eoin and Ella. 
“More like future ex-husband,” Deirdre’s brother-in-law Martin whispered under his breath, not helping matters at all. 
Citing two dates they had gone reasonably well and a half remembered and drunken conversation about ‘wanting kids’ the 36-year-old school teacher was happy to report she had ‘called off the search’, much to the confusion of Daniel, who could have sworn Deirdre said they were going to the cinema and not to her sister’s house for a sit down meal. 
“I thought Graham was your boyfriend,” said one of Deirdre’s nieces, veering wildly off a carefully worded script provided to her by her mother, Elaine, as part of an effort to ensure one of Deirdre’s triggers weren’t activated. 
For his part, Daniel smiled politely and engaged in small talk as part of what he was almost sure was his last ever date with Deirdre.",0

Just this summer he restored voting rights to thousands of felons with the hopes of garnering more votes for Clinton (I’m surprised his legislation wasn’t entitled, “Felons for Felons!”). 
Now we’ve found out that he and his money are likely part of the reason why Hillary Clinton was not prosecuted for her e-mail scandal. 
In a story line that would make the writers of House of Cards salivate, Governor McAuliffe donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the campaign of the Deputy FBI Director’s wife. 
Yes, you read that right. 
According to Zero Hedge : 
The latest allegation of potential impropriety and conflict of interest involving the Democratic Party and the FBI, which over the summer famously cleared Hillary Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing as relates to her personal email server, comes not from a Podesta email or a Wikileaks disclosure, but the WSJ which overnight reported that the political organization of Virginia Govenor Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email use .

Donald Trump held a rally Wednesday night in the crucial battleground state of North Carolina, and as he spoke, one of his supporters held up a Hillary Clinton doll with a noose around its neck. 
The woman who hung the Democratic nominee in effigy said her name was Ginger Glover. Glover said she decided to hang the “Lyin’ Hillary” doll to show that Clinton should be “incarcerated, at the very least.” 
So does Glover wish harm on the former Secretary of State? She insisted she didn’t: “It’s just for effect.” 
One is left wondering why, if Glover thinks Clinton should be imprisoned, she didn’t dress the doll in an orange jumpsuit or prison stripes. Perhaps she’s simply not bright enough to have thought of doing so. 
In recent weeks, various disturbing and violent displays have shown up at Trump rallies: Earlier this week at a rally in Virginia Beach, Trump supporters took a model of Clinton’s head and mounted it on a stake. 
Also, at that same rally, reporters saw a poster which depicted a bull’s-eye superimposed over Clinton’s face. 
It should also be noted that a frequent chant heard at Trump rallies is the oft-repeated “Lock her up” refrain which was a feature of the GOP convention in Cleveland. Yet the Trump campaign always denies that their supporters are are the least bit violent or seeking confrontations with those who disagree with them. 
Actions speak louder than words, and clearly the Trumpkins are a hate-filled basket of deplorables.

The setting is 1926 New York and Eddie Redmayne plays Newt Scamander, a wizard with a suitcase full of unruly creatures. Kids who grew up on the Harry Potter series should feel at home here. The Times critic Manohla Dargis found the titular beasts a highlight, writing, “With the strange caws and showy displays, these beasties provide a lot of the movie’s easygoing pleasures. ” If it’s sold out: Consider “Doctor Strange,” Marvel’s latest “giddily enjoyable”    adventure film that has been a big draw at the box office, but should be a little easier to get into now that it has been out a few weeks longer. If You Want to Get Away From Family  Done playing nice around the dinner table and seeking a break from the family this holiday? Try this irreverent sequel to the irreverent comedy that became a hit in 2003. Billy Bob Thornton is back as the boozing, womanizing title character. (Did you know he wasn’t the first or even second choice for the role? Find out more in this oral history of the first film.) If You Want to Get Serious After the Holiday For the kind of film that will offer substance as well as a ray of hope, try the   drama “Arrival. ” Amy Adams plays a linguist who figures out a way to communicate with alien visitors. It has sleek visual effects and a twisty narrative. In her review, Manohla Dargis praised the lead performance, writing, “By turns inviting and opaque, Ms. Adams turns softness and quiet into heroic qualities, keeping her voice low, modulated, and using stillness to draw you near. ” If You Want to Keep It Light After Thanksgiving Turkey Stuffed from the meal and in search of a movie that will go down easy? Try the comedy “Almost Christmas. ” The ensemble film focuses on an Alabama family gathering for the holiday, with comic turns from Danny Glover, Gabrielle Union, Omar Epps, J. B. Smoove and a wisecracking Mo’Nique, whom the critic Glenn Kenny called “simply magnificent” in his Times review.",0

21329,Donald Trump Is the 45th President of the United States · Guardian Liberty Voice,"After a long night and a hard election, Donald J. Trump was elected as the 45th President of the United States. In the early hours of November 9, 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the election.
Both candidates helped usher in a new political era; she is the first woman to get this far in a presidential election successfully. Whereas, Trump is the first person to be elected to the highest office in the U.S. who never served in the military and never served in a political capacity.
When the night culminated with Trump winning well over the required 270 electoral votes, the election was called. The reality star now holds a new title, President Elect Donald J. Trump.
His presidency will begin with Republicans holding the majority in both chambers of Congress. President-Elect Trump will be nominating a new Supreme Court Justice to fill the seat vacated when Antonin Scalia died in February.
Surprising Night at the Polls On November 8, the polls began to close at 6:00 p.m. ET on the east coast. Whereas on the west coast, the polls closed 11:00 p.m. There were early projections, which made hearts race. The numbers bounced back and forth in many key swing states. That is until eastern state’s tallies began to roll in, then the numbers evened out.
Polling Site Glitches Many polling sites experienced technical issues. Trump attempted early in the day to sue Nevada because the polls in Clark County remained open for an hour and a half on Nov. 7. The judge stated there was no fraud since the state’s law indicates if a person is in line before the polling site closes, they must be allowed to cast their ballot.
In Durham County, N.C., there was a delay beginning the votes, so the Democratic Party sought to have the time extended to make up for time lost. This was granted, and the polls remained open for 30 of the 45 minutes requested.
Donald Trump Needs to Reunite the Country Commentators on CNN Politics agree that the campaign tore through the fabric that makes America great. During the campaigning, citizens became polarized into two drastically divisive and hateful camps.
How is President Elect Trump going to heal the wounds he inflicted on Clinton’s supporters, the Muslim community, Latino citizens, and every other group?
During Trump’s campaign, he threatened to have Clinton arrested when he won, build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, close the mosques, and restart stop and search policies. He said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and lower the tax ceiling for the richest Americans.
His supporters are thrilled, and Clinton’s voters are stunned. There are fear and confusion in the air.
Hillary Clinton Concedes Clinton sent out her campaign manager to tell her supporters that it was late and the final tallies were not going to happen soon. She asked them to go home and get some rest. The announcement was made that Clinton would speak in the morning.
Within an hour, Trump told his supporters that she had called him and conceded. The President-Elect proffered a simple acceptance. He stated that his was not a campaign but a movement for change.

21335,Celebrities Defend Stephen Colbert’s ’C*ck Holster’ Joke,"Several Hollywood celebrities came to Stephen Colbert’s defense this week after the Late Show host sparked a social media firestorm when he made what some critics called a homophobic and vitriolic joke about President Donald Trump during a broadcast. [“The only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin’s c*ck holster,” Colbert said during his monologue on Monday night’s Late Show, during which he also called the president a “ ” and a “ . ”  The joke elicited    laughs from Colbert’s studio audience but the real reaction came later on social media, as thousands of viewers demanded that CBS penalize the   host for what they said was an   attack on the president, and the hashtag #FireColbert became a trending topic on Twitter. Still, some celebrities leapt to the   host’s defense, including Star Trek actor George Takei, comedian Patton Oswalt, and actress Rosie O’Donnell. “Now the little right wing mushrooms want to #FireColbert because he made fun of the Troll King. Waaaa! It’ll go as well as #BoycottHamilton,” Takei wrote on Twitter Wednesday, appearing to refer to the social media outrage that enveloped the Broadway show Hamilton when the cast lectured Vice President Mike Pence from the stage during a performance in November.

The supportive messages from celebrities come as both Colbert and CBS have remained silent on the controversy and social media campaign. Neither the   host nor the network had issued a public statement as of Wednesday evening, and representatives for CBS did not immediately return Breitbart News’ request for comment. On Wednesday, CBS announced that the May 9 episode of The Late Show would reunite the stars of Comedy Central’s Daily Show, on which Colbert got his start. Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, John Oliver, Rob Corddry and Ed Helms are set as guests for the episode.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0

21343,"Wikileaks’ Julian Assange at Embassy Balcony: ’I Will Not Forgive And Forget’, Criticises CIA and European Union","Wikileaks founder Julian Assange appeared on the Ecuadorian embassy balcony Friday afternoon after Sweden announced they were dropping the investigation into alleged rapes. [Calling today’s development an “important victory” Mr Assange, 45, who has been claiming political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy since 2012 to escape extradition to the United States where he faces accusations of espionage, slammed the “terrible injustice” that led to his incarceration, and the European Union for creating the situation that allowed it to develop.  Speaking to journalists from the balcony, Mr Assange said: “Seven years without charge, while my children grew up without me. That is not something I can forgive, it is not something I can forget. “The inevitable enquiry into what has occurred in this moment of terrible injustice is something that I hope will be just about me and this situation. Because the reality is, detention and extradition without charge has become a feature of the European Union. A feature that has been exploited, yes, in my case, for political reasons, but in other cases has subjected many people to terrible injustice”. Criticising the developing practice of detention without trial and the   arrest warrant, to which the United Kingdom is no longer party, Mr Assange continued: “In Sweden, indefinite detention is policy. There is no time limited someone can be detained without charge. “This is now how we expect a civilised state to behave. Similarly, extradition without charge is not something we expect from the rule of law in the United Kingdom. It is a measure that was introduced as part of the European Union system to turn the EU into a federation”. Acknowledging that he still faces arrest by the UK for breaking bail and failing to surrender himself to court while in the embassy, he continued: “The UK has said it will arrest me regardless. “The United States, CIA director Pompeo and the US attorney general have said I and other Wikileaks staff have no rights, no first amendment rights, and our arrest is a priority. That’s not acceptable  …     My legal staff have contacted the UK authorities and we have to engage in a dialogue about what is the best way forward. “To some extent, the UK has been exploited by the processes from the European Union where it agreed to extradite people without charge. A forced position the UK has been put into and the first part of that is over”. Mr Assange said despite the threats against him the work of Wikileaks would continue, and the pace of leaks published targeting the United States’ CIA organisation would intensify. He also hailed the release of “Chelsea Manning” a U. S. Army soldier and intelligence analyst who was incarcerated at a military prison for leaking cables to Wikileaks. Assange called the release a “very important victory” remarking “we and others have managed to have him released 28 years early from his sentence”.    ",0
21344,3 More Reported Held in Bastille Day Truck Attack in Nice - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   France, still reeling from the attack on Thursday in the southern coastal city of Nice that killed 84 people, observed its second of three days of national mourning on Sunday, as the French police held three more people in connection with the assault, according to news reports. The nation has been left wondering whether the attack, in which a Tunisian man plowed a   refrigerated truck through crowds gathered for fireworks on Bastille Day, could have been avoided  —   or whether it must adjust to a harsh new reality. On Saturday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault, calling the driver, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, its “soldier. ” But no evidence has emerged so far that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, 31, a delivery truck driver living in Nice, was in contact with the Islamic State, or that he was exposed to its propaganda. A man and a woman were arrested Sunday morning, French news media reported, and another man was detained later on Sunday, according to Agence  . None were identified, although some reports said that the man and woman were an Albanian couple, and that the man was suspected of providing Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel with the automatic pistol he used on the night of the attack. Four other people had been taken in for questioning on Friday and Saturday. Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel’s estranged wife, who had also been taken in for questioning, was released without charges on Sunday. Her lawyer,   Garino, told the BFM TV news channel that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel was physically violent with her and other members of the family. She eventually threw him out and was no longer in touch with him, Mr. Garino added. Although they have not put forth specific evidence, French officials say Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel appeared to have taken the path to extremism very shortly before the attack. In an interview published on Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said the kind of terrorism seen in Nice was “hard to anticipate,” noting that the killer had “radicalized very quickly. ” “Daesh provides unbalanced individuals with an ideological kit that gives their acts meaning,” Mr. Valls said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “The investigation will have to prove it, but that was probably the case for the attack in Nice. ” There were reports on Sunday that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel had spent time researching his route on the waterfront promenade where the attack unfolded, as he was caught on surveillance cameras driving the truck in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday. Agence   and other French news media, quoting anonymous police officials, also reported on Sunday that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel had sent a text message shortly before the attack in which he appeared to ask for more weapons, but it was unclear whom the message had been for and what exactly it had said. Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel used an automatic pistol to shoot at the police officers who tried to stop him on the promenade several fake weapons were also found in his truck after he was fatally shot. On Sunday, people continued to gather in Nice and in many other French cities to hold minutes of silence or to commemorate the victims. In Paris, there was a Mass at the Cathedral of   on Sunday evening. The Paris prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Sunday that 49 people hurt in the attack remained in critical condition, 18 of them fighting for their lives. The total number of injured was 256, down from a figure provided on Saturday by the Health Ministry. The prosecutor’s office also said that the French authorities had sped up the process to identify the dead, but that only 35 had been formally identified so far. At least 10 children were killed and 35 hurt. Families and tourists had gathered on the waterfront on Thursday evening to watch fireworks celebrating Bastille Day.",0

21351,3 States Approve Recreational Marijuana; Nationwide Is Next,"3 States Approve Recreational Marijuana; Nationwide Is Next Nov 9, 2016 2 0 
As we reported last night , three states have approved the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, which includes California, Nevada and Massachusetts. As of the morning of November 9th, Maine is reportedly close to also approving the legalization, with 91% of the votes counted and a “yes” vote currently being the favorite. 
In addition to the three and possibly four states legalizing recreational use of marijuana, three states have approved the legalization of medical marijuana, which includes Florida, Arkansas and North Dakota. Marijuana States of America 
With California, Massachusetts and Nevada and possibly Maine approving recreational marijuana, they join Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska as states who have already approved the same laws. 
With this in mind, we now have 7 states having approved the full legalization of marijuana. What is now to stop the rest of the country? Most likely nothing. There is a saying that “as California goes, so goes the nation.” 
California has led the way in marijuana laws for the past 20 years and this latest step is yet another sign that the nation is quickly heading in the same direction. Undoubtedly, this will be a big topic for many legislators in the days and weeks to come. With 7 states now approved for recreational use, the people have gained even more leverage in the push for a nationwide approval. 
The arguments for those against be facing a tough situation as it will soon be very well known that a full 7 states have approved this measure, with many others with medical approval. Times are quickly changing. 
Many see this as a positive sign in the awakening of humanity for a couple different reasons. 
First is that marijuana has been reported by millions to have helped them to “wake up” and see through different distractions and illusions that society has put forth, through education, media, the medical system and politics itself. To some, this is direct evidence that the Elite has lost control and that the global awakening of humanity is spreading even quicker now. 
The other reason is that this will now allow for an even greater push for the legalization of industrial hemp to be grown in all 50 states once again. As many know, hemp is an excellent resource which can be made into clothing, food, medicine, shelter and many other things, as well as create new jobs. 
Even the Establishment sees the writing on the wall. In a recent interview with Bill Maher , President Obama said that passage of the legalization measures on Tuesday could make the current federal approach to the drug “untenable.” In other words, what has just happened has made nationwide legalization unstoppable.

21352,"EXCLUSIVE: Carnival Corporation’s Alleged Outsourcing Plan Sends Jobs to India, Europe","Carnival Corporation, with the help of an outsourcing firm, is set to offshore hundreds of American jobs overseas to India and Eastern Europe, according to an alleged leaked  document obtained by Breitbart Texas. [The document depicts a map showing the American positions which the company will purportedly outsource to two foreign regions, leaving hundreds of American workers jobless.  Positions listed as moving from the U. S. to India, according to the alleged internal document, include a mix of high and   jobs involving: Meanwhile the jobs allegedly being offshored to Poland and Romania include: The only jobs listed to be allegedly remaining in the U. S. within the company’s IT department involve account, operational, and compliance management and   support, among others. A source close to Breitbart Texas said earlier this year in February, Carnival Corporation began executing the outsourcing plan led by Capgemini, telling Americans to either take jobs with the outsourcing firm and risk being fired six months later or leave the company altogether. Carnival Corporation teamed up with Capgemini, a French outsourcing firm, to allegedly mass   the American IT workers remaining at the company who had yet to be replaced by cheaper, foreign workers. In a statement to Breitbart Texas regarding the allegations of offshoring, Carnival Corporation Spokesman Roger Frizzell said: This is a relatively small group of employees within the company  —   roughly 130 people within our IT organization  —   that moved over several months ago to Capgemini, which has offices in Miami and throughout the U. S. A vast majority of these individuals  —   100 or so  —   will continue in their existing IT roles to support Carnival Corporation at their existing Carnival office locations (and existing salaries). Discussions are underway with the remaining 30 employees, who are being considered for other positions in the U. S. within Capgemini. It also important to note that every Carnival employee within this IT group was offered employment several months ago with Capgemini as they evaluated the needs of our business. As I mentioned, more than 100 of these individuals are continuing in their existing roles in support of Carnival Corporation in the same Carnival Corporation office location.   …     Based on the latest update from Capgemini, it looks as if they are optimistic that new positions and opportunities will be found for the other 30 employees. A source familiar with Carnival’s alleged outsourcing plan said they “doubted” the company’s claim that only 130 employees were impacted by the changes, saying at the original group of employees impacted was likely closer to about 250. “We were forced to take the Capgemini jobs,” the source told Breitbart Texas. “They forced me into Capgemini and because I didn’t take it, they said I resigned, but I didn’t. I wasn’t given a choice. ” The source also said that although many employees did take jobs at Capgemini originally, some eventually left their new positions because they understood that their job would eventually be   overseas. Capgemini, like other outsourcing firms such as Infosys and Tata Consulting, is known for contracting with major U. S. corporations to replace Americans through the   visa. After they are replaced with   foreign workers, the jobs are eventually offshored altogether. As reported by Breitbart Texas, domestic companies have been able to get away with importing   foreign workers by hiding   visa applications behind the outsourcing firms they partner with. In Carnival Corporation’s case, the company has the potential to deny any such offshoring and   of Americans, as Capgemini is technically handling the operation.

While the United States should not become Vladimir Putin’s best friend, we also have to realize that Russia is a super power in this world and we must take them seriously. 
Hillary and Obama dislike Putin because he only answers to strength and toughness, which is exactly why it is evident he likes Donald Trump.

21355,Watch: Police and Journalists Attacked During Swedish School Riot,"Eleven “youths” have been arrested after a riot broke out at a school in Sweden that saw both police and TV journalists attacked with rocks by an angry mob. [The riot occurred at the Alléskolan school in the town of Hallsberg on Monday afternoon. According to police, glass bottles and rocks were thrown at them, as well as at journalists. Officers say they have arrested 11 young men in connection with the riots and said they have no idea what started the conflict which escalated rapidly, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.   The SVT team, headed by reporter Anders Nord, were on the scene for the riot and were also attacked by the young men. Mr. Nord said that while police had arrested some of the youths, “another group of masked youths, a little further away, shouted at police and threw stones. The scene commander then gave the order to police to put on helmets and approached the youth, who then ran from the scene. ” In total, police say around 30 individuals participated in the riot, though there were no reports of any serious injuries on the scene. The youths aren’t thought to be students at the school, but outsiders according to policeman Mats Öhman. “They came to the school from what I understand was a continuation of a fight that was from last Friday,” he said. Öhman described how the events unfolded saying: “It was pretty uncomfortable. It happened before we got on our helmets and the attack came as a bolt from the blue. Had anyone got hit in the head it would have been bad. ” The fight that took place on Friday, which authorities say led to the Monday riot, is also mentioned on the Swedish police website with the police describing it as “messy” and saying that two factions of young men fought with each other.  Police did not identify the origins of the suspects involved on Friday or Monday, through video footage obtained by Swedish paper Nerikes Allehanda shows men who look to be of a foreign background. Attacks on police in Sweden have become increasingly more common and along with other issues have led to many officers quitting the force entirely. The main areas of danger for police have been the 55 or so No Go Zones across the country which are mostly populated by migrants. Even ambulance drivers have requested   helmets and other equipment to protect themselves from attack. Journalists in Sweden have also been attacked by “youths” in the last year. Most recently, a photographer for Swedish Newspaper Dagens Nyheter was attacked during the recent riots in the no go area of Rinkeby and last year an Australian TV crew was attacked in the same area.

21356,Supreme Court Rules Priests DO NOT Have to Report Child Abuse,"In a highly controversial decision, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that Catholic priests are not “mandatory reporters” of child abuse they are made privy to as a result of administering sacramental confessions. 
According to Patheos , the ruling references article 609 A(1) of the Louisiana Children’s Code: 
With respect to mandatory reporters: Notwithstanding any claim of privileged communication, any mandatory reporter who has cause to believe that a child’s physical or mental health or welfare is endangered as a result of abuse or neglect or that abuse or neglect was a contributing factor in a child’s death shall report in accordance with Article 610. 
The Oct. 28 ruling states in part: 
… any communication made to a priest privately in the sacrament of confession for the purpose of confession, repentance, and absolution is a confidential communication under La. Code Evid. 511, and the priest is exempt from mandatory reporter status in such circumstances by operation of La. Child. Code art. 603, because “under the … tenets of the [Roman Catholic] church” he has an inviolable “duty to keep such communications confidential.” 
The case which originally brought this issue before the court was that of a young woman who told a Baton Rouge-area Catholic priest that a longtime parishioner had sexually assaulted her when she was 14-years-old. The priest in turn did not report the abuse.

[“To residents of Maryland, catching an occasional glimpse of a huge white blimp floating in the sky is not unusual,” proclaimed The Intercept’s Ryan Gallagher on Monday. “But less known is that the test flights have sometimes served a more secretive purpose involving National Security Agency surveillance. ”  “Back in 2004, a division of the NSA called the National Tactical Integration Office fitted a   diameter airship called the Hover Hammer with an eavesdropping device,” he continued, adding that “The agency launched the   airship at an airfield near Solomons Island, Maryland. ” The blimp was reportedly referred to publicly as an “antenna mounting platform,” and comprises of a “  sphere inside another sphere, constructed of Spectra, the same material used to make   vests. ” “From there, the blimp was able to vacuum up ‘international shipping data emanating from the Long Island, New York area,’” Gallagher explained, citing a classified document published on Monday. “The spy equipment on the airship was called Digital Receiver Technology  —   a proprietary system manufactured by a   company of the same name  —   which can intercept wireless communications, including cellphone calls. ” In his report, Gallagher notes that, “Unsurprisingly, privacy groups have expressed concerns about the prospect of the blimps being used domestically to spy on Americans. However, military officials have often been quick to dismiss such fears. ” “In August 2015, Lt. Shane Glass told Baltimore broadcaster WBAL that the JLENS blimps being tested in Maryland were not equipped with cameras or eavesdropping devices,” he stated, before concluding that “The same cannot be said, it seems, of the NSA’s Hover Hammer. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

21361,Clinton emails: FBI director ignored Attorney General's advice not to 'take action that could influence election',"Trending Articles: Trending Articles: Clinton emails: FBI director ignored Attorney General's advice not to 'take action that could influence election'   Source: The Independent 
FBI director James Comey reportedly ignored the advice of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who urged him not to thrust the controversy over Hillary Clinton’s emails back into headlines less than a fortnight from election day. 
US Department of Justice officials, Democrats and even some Republicans were said to be aghast at the timing of the FBI’s announcement, on Friday, that it was reviewing a fresh cache of emails, which Mr Comey said may be “pertinent” to the investigation into Ms Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. 
According to a report from the New Yorker , Ms Lynch “expressed her preference” that Mr Comey uphold the Justice Department's “longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations, and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election.” The FBI director, however, “said that he felt compelled to do otherwise.” 
Writing in the Washington Post , former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Mr Comey’s decision was a “troubling violation of long-standing Justice Department rules or precedent, conduct that raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to serve as the nation’s chief investigative official.” 
The emails were discovered “in connection with an unrelated case,” the FBI director wrote in a letter to Republican congressional committee chairs on Friday. That separate case, it later emerged, concerns disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner , who is under investigation for allegedly sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. 
Mr Weiner is the estranged husband of Ms Clinton’s closest aide, Huma Abedin , and the emails were found on one or more electronic devices belonging to the couple, which had been seized as part of the Weiner probe. The FBI is now investigating whether those emails contained any classified information.",0
21362,Sundance Horror Hit Casts ’Liberal Elite’ as the Monster,"Comedian Jordan Peele debuted his new horror film, Get Out, this week at the Sundance Film Festival, and the most shocking thing about the film is its bad guy: white liberal racism. [“It was very important to me for this not to be about a black guy going to the South and going to this red state where the presumption for a lot of people is everybody’s racist there,” Peele told the audience after the film’s midnight screening. “This was meant to take a stab at the liberal elite that tends to believe that ‘We’re above these things. ’”  Get Out follows the events that unfold when a young black man Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) meets the wealthy liberal parents of his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) who are carrying out an evil plan to imprison their   suburb’s few black residents.  The idea for Get Out  —   a film which Peele thought “was never going to get made”  —   came during the 2008 presidential primary battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. “All of a sudden the country was kind of focused on black civil rights and women’s civil rights movements and where they intersect, and there was kind of this question of, who deserves to be president more?” Peele explained. “Who’s waited long enough? Which is an absurd thing  —   that civil rights are even divided. ” Drawing from The Stepford Wives, Peele’s favorite film, the comic was able to develop a plot that exposed what he called the “  lie” that “we’re past” this “monster of racism”  —   a lie that Peele admits doesn’t flow from “red states. ” One example of this “  lie” in the film is evident when Chris’s girlfriend fails to mention to her neurosurgeon father (Bradley Whitford) that her new boyfriend is black. Rose’s father constantly calls Chris “my man,” admits that he would have voted for Obama for a third term, and said his father lost at the Olympics to Jesse Owens and has affinity for the Nazis. It all feels like soft bigotry, Peele explains to the audience. “That is how we experience racism. The monster of racism lurks underneath that conversation. ” Get Out, Peele says, is “coming out in a very different America” than the one in which he wrote the script for the film. “It’s more important and interesting now,” he says, in the era of President Trump. Peele is perhaps best known for his starring role on the hit Comedy Central series Key and Peele, where his portrayal of a   President Obama became an Internet sensation. The comedian recently reprised the role on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show for one final time alongside   Key, who played President Obama’s “anger translator” Luther. Get Out opens in theaters on February 24.    Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson",0
21365,Will the Media Reset After the Election or Are We Stuck With This Tabloid Stuff?,"Written by Peter Van Buren   venerable New York Times ran a story saying Donald Trump lies about the height of his buildings.For no apparent reason, the Times resurrected some information from 1979 saying Trump insisted on counting the basement levels of his signature Trump Tower in the overall count of how many floors the building has. The Times compares this lie to “reports” that Trump adds an inch to his actual body height in his bio materials, and also repeated the gag line that he boasted about how long his penis is (no word on whether it is or is not actually longer than expected.)You have to wade down to paragraph 12 to learn other New York developers use the same count-the-basements levels gimmick to be able to advertise their buildings as taller. There is absolutely no news. The Russians Head over to Slate , which published an “investigative piece” alleging a Trump computer server was secretly communicating with a Russian bank. The story had previously been debunked by the New York Times and The Intercept, but Slate ran it as if they had uncovered the smoking gun proving Trump is under the control of the Russians.At Mother Jones , another article alleged that an anonymous, former intelligence officer provided the FBI with information on a Russian scheme to help Trump win the presidency.“There’s no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spy’s memos,” the story said. “But a Russian intelligence attempt to co-opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking.”One more example, from Vox , which wrote without even bothering to source it at all “There is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election, and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. There is strong evidence linking Trump’s foreign policy advisers to Russia, and Trump’s stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests.” Journalism Much? I’ve chosen these examples because they are from publications that have in the past enjoyed decent reputations for reporting, and because these stories were run as “news,” not opinion columns, where the standards go right through the floor. Even Mother Jones, which clearly works left-of-center, used to do so with some solid journalism.Not any more.These places (never find fringe publications) are now working with the same standards once reserved for reporting on aliens at Roswell, Elvis sightings and the Illuminati New World Order. It is apparently now within the bounds of mainstream journalism to build a story out of, well, nothing, such as a factoid from 1979, or essentially accuse a presidential candidate of treason based on a single, anonymous source, or claim the Russians have taken over our electoral process based on no sources at all. And Clinton… On the other side, reporting on Clinton by many of these same publications swerves between hagiography and poo-pooing away anything unfavorable. Emails? Who cares! Questions about what her accomplishments as Secretary of State really were? If you ask, you hate women. Pay-for-Play with the Clinton Foundation? Hah, everybody does it, it doesn’t matter. The standard seems to be absent a notarized receipt for a donation matching an arms sale, or a criminal conviction, nothing matters. Next? So be it. The media has fully sh*t the bed this election. That’s where we find ourselves.But what’s next? Will the media reset itself after November 8, or will they run President Trump is Putin’s dog stories for the full term? Will President Clinton be given a pass on, well, everything, for four years, with apologists and explainers on the front page of the Times, never mind in editorials?At what point will the media dig themselves out of this and start real reporting again?

21366,Merkel Will Pay Migrants Millions To Leave Germany,"Chancellor Angela Merkel is setting aside €90m (£76m) in taxpayers’ money to create a fund which will pay migrants to withdraw their asylum applications and leave Germany voluntarily. [The handouts will form part of a   plan to speed up the removal of rejected asylum seekers, after Tunisian migrant Anis Amri murdered a Polish lorry driver, hijacked his vehicle and drove it into a Christmas market in Berlin while awaiting deportation.  U. S. president Donald Trump told The Times that Merkel made a “catastrophic mistake” when she opened the doors to an unlimited number of migrants in 2015. Her   Sigmar Gabriel, later admitted that his superior had underestimated how difficult it would be to integrate migrants on such a grand scale, and that Germany had been plunged into a kulturkampf, or “cultural war” as a result. Germany rejected 170, 000 asylum claims in 2016 but, according to the Mail, just 26, 000 were repatriated. 55, 000 more decided to leave voluntarily  —   apparently leaving 81, 000 bogus applicants unaccounted for. “We rely heavily on voluntary departures,” admitted Chancellor Merkel, who was announcing the package after falling behind the Social Democrats in polls for Germany’s upcoming elections. Martin Schulz, the former President of the European Parliament who has been nominated as the Social Democrat challenger to Merkel, said he backed the proposals to speed up deportations. Schulz has previously insisted that “the people who are arriving [in Europe] are refugees who have been threatened [and] we should welcome them”  —   a statement which is at odds with the   of the European Commission’s admission that at least 60 per cent are economic migrants. As a leading figure in the European Union, Schulz was a strong supporter of the compulsory migrant quotas. These were forced through by the bloc despite strong opposition from central and eastern European   which did not agree with Germany’s unilateral decision to throw open the borders. Schulz hit out strongly at these countries in 2015, accusing them of “national egotism in its purest form”. Polish interior minister Mariusz Blaszczak described at Schulz’s words as “an example of German arrogance”.",0
21368,Kellyanne Conway LOSES IT On Jake Tapper When He Calls Out Trump’s Bigoted Fans (VIDEO),"on October 30, 2016 2:24 pm · 
One thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trump’s people try to say he doesn’t want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: 
“There are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy.” 
Conway immediately went on defense, saying, “wow.” Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting ‘JEW-S-A’ at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as ‘deplorable.’ She responded: 
“Yes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe — I hope you’ve been to Trump rallies and I hope that you’ve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, he’s had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans.” 
Tapper went on to say that no, he isn’t putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conway’s hand on this one: 
“But without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. 
Mr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,” Tapper continued. “He just has. He says things like, “Oh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.’ But he has never serious said, ‘I don’t want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.’ He has never seriously done it.” 
Conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: 
“I think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that we’re actually going to win in nine days because the idea that we’re going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week.” 
No, Kellyanne, it’s not a sign that Trump is winning. It’s pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and it’s all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because he’s one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better.

21378,Report: Michigan State Bans Whiteboards to Prevent Spread of Racist Messages - Breitbart,"Administrators at Michigan State University have introduced a policy which will prevent students from hanging white boards outside of their dorm rooms in an effort to prevent racist messages from appearing on dormitory walls. [The new policy, which will go into effect in Fall 2017, will prevent students from putting up white boards outside of their dorm rooms in an effort to curb issues with bullying on campus.  “In any given month, there are several incidents like this. There was no one incident that was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Kat Cooper, director of University Residential Services Communications. “Sometimes these things are racial, sometimes they’re sexual in nature. There are all sorts of things that happen. ”   Cooper argued that the increasing amount of inappropriate messages written on white boards was enough for the school to rethink their policy on their usage in dormitory hallways. “Their utility as a communication tool no longer outweighed the attractive nuisance that they are,” Kat Cooper said. Other students aren’t thrilled about the new policy. Michigan State sophomore Brad Kain claimed that it is unfair to the students who “use them on their doors” as a way to “brighten up people’s day. ” “We’re all adults,” Kain said. “I think they should find another way of handling the problem,” Johnson said.",0
21379,"Pope Francis Takes Backhanded Swipe At Trump, & Those Who 'Raise Walls, & Label People'","0 129 
On Saturday, during a ceremony welcoming 17 new cardinals into the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis warned attendees about the divisiveness that he feels is spreading throughout the church. The Associated Press reports that Pope Francis cautioned against the “virus of polarization,” telling the new group of cardinals, “we are not immune from this.” 
During his speech, Pope Francis specifically issued a warning about “our pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose, and condemn” and those who “raise walls, build barriers, and label people.” He also encouraged those in attendance to not be so quick to deem those who are different from them an enemy or a threat. 
‘We see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. 
‘The virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.’ 
Pope Francis never called out Donald Trump by name; however, it seems to be more than a mere coincidence that he delivered a speech about accepting immigrants shortly after the United States electorate chose as their leader for the next four years a man who has proposed mass deportation and the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
This is not the first time that the Pope has spoken out against Donald Trump and his campaign promises, either. In February of this year, when asked about Trump’s proposed border wall, he said , “a person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.” 
At least one of the newly appointed cardinals has views similar to Pope Francis’s when it comes to immigration. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin, who was in the news recently for helping to resettle Syrian refugees despite now vice president-elect Mike Pence’s best efforts to block aid to and limit the number of Syrian refugees in Indiana. 
Tobin recently addressed Trump’s victory, saying that, under him, the priority of settling immigrants and refugees “is going to be challenging.” He added, though, that he believes “the ethical reflection of a nation isn’t reduced to the government” and said that he has “a lot of faith in the American people.”

Exit polling is not only legal but its something done in all civilized countries in the world. Democrats want to steal and prevent anyone from exposing their thievery. Exit polling provides perfectly accurate results and if in some state GOP gets for example 55% in exit polls and then 40% or whatever in final results, then we know there was fraud involved in that state. The usual accepted error between actual final results and exit polling can’t be bigger than 2%.

These days it has most certainly become chic for the modern liberal to throw about accusations of racism. Although this type of race-baiting has been going on for a number of years now, it became more noticeable during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. When these liberals accuse Donald Trump of being racist, they had better be careful for one specific reason: 
A leaked video from 2008 shows that during President Obama ’s first campaign, he was also concerned about border security, and he even suggested a wall! Now, there is just one dominant question anti- Trump individuals need to digest: 
Is Obama a racist too? Because he was talking about some things you could easily accuse Trump of. Let’s play a quick game. If you didn’t know who said this, would you think it was Donald Trump in 2016 or Barack Obama in 2008? 
This man’s core goal was to “preserve the integrity of our borders to reduce illegal immigration.” Does this sound like Trump or Obama ? 
How about this one? This man said, “additional fencing could help get our border under control.” Definitely sounds more like a GOP candidate than a Democrat one, that’s for sure. 
Finally, this man also supported “additional personnel, infrastructure, and technology on our border and at ports of entry.” Liberals would love to claim these quotes came from Donald J. Trump , especially considering he is the villain du jour in their lives at the moment. 
I hate to steal their thunder, but these quotes did indeed come from a young Barack Obama in 2008. Even he understood the need for a controlled border before the special interests in this country got to him. 
So, it is one thing when leaked videos show Hillary Clinton believed border security was important. It was entirely another when they showed that her husband thought it was important, but when liberal idol Barack Obama says it? Say it isn’t so! Liberals just can’t handle that. 
But anyway, folks, it is all about platforms. I’m sure you have learned by now that Donald Trump doesn’t get the free pass other politicians in this country enjoy. First of all, he is a conservative, so he is already someone every liberal loves to hate. 
Republicans have been so badly demonized in this country simply for desiring to get it under control. Luckily, people saw through the propaganda and decided that Obama ’s brand was simply not working any longer. 
People are fed up with politicians who say one thing and do another. If you are looking for a reason why Donald Trump is the new president and not Hillary Clinton, there you go. ",0
21396,What to Know About Trump’s Order to Dismantle the Clean Power Plan - The New York Times,"President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that calls on Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to take steps to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, a set of rules regulating energy plants powered by fossil fuels. The plan, which would have regulated carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil   electricity plants, has been tied up in courts for more than a year, after more two dozen states, industry representatives and others sued the E. P. A. They claimed that the plan was unconstitutional, and it hadn’t yet taken effect because the Supreme Court had said the plan could not be carried out while it was being argued before a lower federal court. Mr. Trump criticized the Clean Power Plan during the campaign and promised to bring back coal mining jobs and create new jobs in the fossil fuel industry the rules would have made that more difficult. Mr. Pruitt, as Oklahoma’s attorney general, sued the E. P. A. 14 times over environmental regulations, including the Clean Power Plan. The problem for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt is that, if they get rid of this plan, they are legally required to come up with another one. Plus, in order to repeal regulations, federal agencies have to follow the same   system (requiring periods of public notice and comment) used to create regulations, which can take about a year. Keep in mind that 18 state attorneys general and several environmental advocacy groups had previously moved to defend the rule, and they may challenge whatever alternative Mr. Pruitt might devise. Some of the arguments against the Clean Power Plan have come from the fossil fuel industries  —   specifically the coal industry, since   power plants are the main target of the rules. They have argued that the plan is overly punitive toward them. However, the proliferation of cheap natural gas and a rise in renewable energy sources have made coal less financially sustainable. Removing regulations on   power plants wouldn’t necessarily bring back a lot of coal jobs. Most coal mining, especially mountaintop removal mining, is done by machines, so it would be hard to bring back the thousands of jobs that have been lost as coal becomes less and less profitable. And opening up more federal lands and waters to fossil fuel extraction might lead to a glut of coal in the market, which could make it even less financially viable than it is now. The Obama administration used the creation of the Clean Power Plan to show other countries that the United States was serious about taking meaningful action on climate change during the Paris climate talks in late 2015. The plan is the most significant part of the strategy to cut emissions by the amount specified in the Paris agreement. Even with the Clean Power Plan in effect, it would have been tough for the United States to meet its Paris agreement targets. Without the plan or another one at least as stringent on greenhouse gases, it will be nearly impossible, experts say. If the rule is completely abandoned and no comparable alternative is offered, it might signal to the rest of the world that the United States isn’t serious about its obligations under the Paris agreement (which Mr. Trump has also said he would “cancel,” though there is disagreement about that in his cabinet). That might make other countries feel less bound by the terms of the agreement, too.",0

21398,Rush Limbaugh on Obamacare 2.0: ’Why Do the Republicans Want to Hurt Trump’s Base?’ - Breitbart,"Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh questioned why Congressional Republicans seem determined to inflict pain on Trump’s   base with their healthcare bill on Friday:  Well, here’s the Breitbart piece, ladies and gentlemen. And measured against my plan, this is hieroglyphics. Measured against my plan, this is like trying to learn a foreign language. And not just learn the language, but then learn all of the dialects and all the hidden meaning with the use of slang and so forth. It’s impossible. “Seven Reasons Why Obamacare 2. 0 Is All But Guaranteed to Impose Crushing Costs on Voters, Hurt Trump’s Base, and Hand Power Back to the Democrats. ” Okay, that’s the headline of the Breitbart piece. Let me ask you a question. I mean, the way I react when I see a headline like this, if it’s this bad, how in the world can the people in charge of it not know it’s this bad? If it is this bad, then why do the Republicans want to hand power back to the Democrats? Why do the Republicans want to hurt Trump’s base? Now, that I can answer. Why do Republicans want to impose crushing costs on voters? Does any of this make sense? And why do Republicans want to hand power back to the Democrats? And why does Trump want to do that? Trump supposedly signed on to this. Okay, so let’s take this incrementally. Now, at the bottom of this piece is perhaps the most important aspect of story with nothing to do with health care. “Sixty percent of adults are ‘hopeful and optimistic’ about America’s future. ” As asserted in this story, that’s from polling data.

21399,California Official Says Trump’s Claim of Voter Fraud Is ‘Absurd’ - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   When   Donald J. Trump claimed on Twitter that he was losing the popular vote because of major fraud by millions of voters, one of the states he pointed to was California, where the latest voting returns showed Hillary Clinton, the Democrat, crushing Mr. Trump. But Mr. Trump’s baseless claim led to a furious reaction from California’s top election official, Alex Padilla, the secretary of state, this weekend. Mr. Padilla asserted that there was no evidence for the claim by the   and denounced Mr. Trump for what he said was unpresidential behavior. “His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd,” Mr. Padilla posted on Twitter. “His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a  . ” This state has historically been slow to count ballots, a reflection of both its vast size and inefficiencies in many county voting operations. Given the fact that this is an overwhelmingly Democratic state, that has meant that Mrs. Clinton’s total vote count has grown steadily as ballots were tallied, adding to a national lead of close to two million votes. As of Saturday, Mrs. Clinton had 8. 1 million votes in California, compared with 4. 2 million for Mr. Trump, according to the secretary of state’s office. It was not clear when the vote count might be concluded. The count, and outcome, has been no surprise to anyone in a state with a history of slow  . Officials in both parties had predicted this would happen as early as election night. Given California’s long Democratic history, it was never in play during this presidential election. But as the nation’s most populated state, it tends to have a significant influence on final national voting margins, as is apparently the case this year. Mr. Trump signaled out three states in his post of Twitter on “serious voter fraud”  —   Virginia, New Hampshire and California. He offered no evidence to back up the claim. His remarks came as he denounced calls for a recount in three states that he won by relatively small margins: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Jill Stein, who was the Green Party candidate for president, said that she would move for a recount. Aides to Mrs. Clinton said they would cooperate with the effort, even as they made it clear they thought it would not change the outcome. Mr. Padilla is the   Latino elected to state office in California. Mr. Trump’s poor showing here, many Democrats and Republicans said, came in no small part because of his attacks on what he described as the threat of illegal immigration  —   particularly by Mexicans. About 40 percent of California’s population is Latino. “It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him,” Mr. Padilla said.",0
21400,Putin: Trump Win Is A Massive Defeat For New World Order,"Russia is hoping for a “new understanding” and “restored Russian-American relations” according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be “encouraged” by the American people voting to back themselves and reject the prospect of a New World Order totalitarian world government. 
Via Yournewswire 
According to sources, Putin believes that the result of the U.S. election proves the globalists’ destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand.
“The American people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough. They want change.”
Putin vowed to destroy the New World Order in 2016, and it appears people all over the world have started to wake up and resonate with his goal. The President is “deeply encouraged” that his determination to destroy the invasive organisation’s agenda is shared by people all over the world, and gaining momentum all the time.
This election result represents the biggest uprising by the American people against the elite who run the country since the Boston Tea Party in 1771, and the New World Order controlled puppets in Washington are reeling. All of the elite – politicians, bankers, economists, celebrities – told the people to vote for the NWO selected candidate, Hillary Clinton. But the people are waking up. The people said no.
The Rothschild NWO cabal will be pacing nervously in their mansions, wondering how to deal with this massive, unexpected blow to their globalist agenda. Their roadmap to arriving at a one world government – so close, yet so far away – has been thrown off course by this uprising of the people.
In an annual press conference with his countrymen last April, Putin expressed skepticism about the American electoral process, which he believes is corrupt – elite family clans taking turns occupying the White House. He also hinted at how he personally saw Hillary Clinton.
“First there was Bush senior in power, then Bush junior. [Bill] Clinton was[U.S. President] two times in a row, now his wife has ambitions. Again, the family might stay in power. As they say in Russia, a husband and a wife are the same Satan.”
Neither side of the political establishment wanted Trump anywhere near the White House. The mainstream media were vilifying him. In short, the sock puppets of the New World Order were united against him. They have a lot to lose if somebody who isn’t playing by their rules takes control – and their nightmare has come true.
Do not be surprised if the mainstream media attempt to convince you of something deeply disturbing in the near future. Never in history has the NWO had such a firm grip on mainstream media operations.
The New World Order controlled elites in Washington did not expect this blow and they will be a scrambling to take back control.
Triggered by a massive popular uprising, stoked by wholly rational fears, and fired up by hard facts, America has regained its status as a powerful, sovereign nation. The people chose to make the United States powerful again, to take control of their economy, and make themselves respected in the eyes of the world. They have taken the bull by the horns and backed themselves as American. They have voted for advance over stagnation. It is the answer for our times.

21401,Amazon Increases Robotic Workforce by 50% - Breitbart,"In the last year, Amazon has dramatically increased employment of robots, going from 30, 000 robots in 2015 to 45, 000 in 2016. [When Amazon acquired Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012, they immediately began implementing the squat automatons into their network of massive warehouses. The 16 inch, 320 lb. machines can carry more than twice their own weight and have taken over a sizable chunk of transport and packing tasks.  For now, the increase in robotic employment at Amazon is only outpacing actual people by a narrow margin  —   50% as opposed to 46% more humans, according to The Seattle Times. Human awareness and dexterity still prevent us from becoming a redundant part of these processes  …     for now, as white collar insurance claims agents are being replaced with AI and the development of   synthetic muscle that could make robots as graceful as any person. Amazon is perhaps the biggest company leading the charge toward an automated workforce, in the process of hashing out ideas that range from drone delivery services to the flying motherships that could someday house them. According to Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky, “[Amazon has] changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times, and we continue to learn and grow there. ” They’re already running an Amazon storefront without a single cashier, and their latest corporate campus in Seattle is being built inside of biospheres. We’re constantly seeing news about Amazon’s relentless march into new territory, and the pace continues to increase. I’m not sure whether to buy stock, or build a fallout shelter.

21402,World Animal Population To Be Down By Two-Thirds In 2020,"Natural Blaze As if the November elections weren’t bad enough news for the world, a new report by the Living Planet Index was recently released that contains very frightening visions for the future.
According to the report, the number of living wild animals is expected to fall by two-thirds by 2020 from its 1970 levels. The report suggests that this massive disappearance is actually part of a mass extinction that will have effects that reach every corner of the globe and ultimately destroying the natural world and thus, humanity itself. 
The report is considered the most comprehensive analysis published so far by many experts. It points out that animal populations between 1970 and 2012 declined by 58 percent and that by 2020 it is projected to reach 67 percent. 
In other words, we are in the midst of a mass die-off and only four years away from seeing an irreparable amount of damage to the natural world. 
Researchers from the World Wildlife Fund (an admittedly questionable organization) and the Zoological Society of London were responsible for compiling the report drawn from various data sources and determined that pollution, over-hunting/fishing and the destruction of wild habitats were to blame. 
Not only endangered species like elephants and gorillas are in danger, however. For instance, vultures and salamanders appear to be on their way to extinction and the animals at risk reside in forests, jungles, mountains, deserts, rivers and oceans. 
According to the Guardian , 
The report analysed the changing abundance of more than 14,000 monitored populations of the 3,700 vertebrate species for which good data is available. This produced a measure akin to a stock market index that indicates the state of the world’s 64,000 animal species and is used by scientists to measure the progress of conservation efforts. 
According to the report, logging and the destructing of natural habitats for farming purposes are the biggest cause of animal deaths. Poaching and over fishing and over-hunting for food are other major causes. 
Recent research shows that 300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction . 
Pollution is also an obvious significant factor. 
For instance, dolphins and killer whales in European seas are being killed by the presence of industrial chemicals. In Southeast Asia the vulture population has been decimated for two decades due to the fact that the birds are dying after eating cattle carcasses of cows who had been treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Fungal diseases are having a horrific effect on the amphibian population – a disaster that many believe to be caused by world trade of frogs and newts. 
Rivers and lakes are having the most dramatic declines. Here, animal populations are down 81% since 1970. 
As Marco Lambertini, Director General of WWF, said: 
The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse. 
While Westerners wring their hands and obsess over CO2, they continue to ignore real environmental catastrophes like industrial chemical pollution, over-fishing, loss of biodiversity through genetic modification and unsustainable farming. 
If the world wants to survive 21st century, it will immediately begin to look at ways in which development and higher living standards can be produced while at the same time ensuring that the natural world is protected. 
At this point, we have no other choice.",0

21419,US Military Prepares To Shut Down Russia’s Internet If It Hacks The Election,"US Military Prepares To Shut Down Russia’s Internet If It Hacks The Election 11/08/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
American hackers recently broke into Russia’s communications networks, electrical grid and government systems in preparation for a retaliatory cyber strike should Russian hackers meddle in the U.S. election, according to NBC News. 
Officials do not expect any major attacks on U.S. infrastructure, which would be tantamount to an act of war, but they are concerned that Russian hackers may meddle in the election by spreading false information. The hacker “Guccifer 2.0” — which officials and some cyber security experts believe is a front for Russian intelligence — claimed they would be monitoring elections “from inside the system.” 
The U.S. preparations are no different than Russia and China’s probing of U.S. networks. The penetration caused no damage to Russia, instead it was the equivalent of a military scouting mission. Cyber weapons could be deployed if the U.S. suffered a significant attack, but officials tell NBC News that is an unlikely scenario. Just to be sure though, Obama administration officials issued a back-channel warning to Russia to stay out of the election. 
“You’d gain access to a network, you’d establish your presence on the network and then you’re poised to do what you would like to do with the network,” Gary Brown, a former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), told NBC News. 
U.S. cyber capabilities are top of the line, but the Obama administration has been wary of deploying them, despite consistent Russian provocation. CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency, the agencies responsible for U.S. cyber security, are incredibly secretive regarding U.S. capabilities. Stuxnet is the most well-known, publicized U.S. cyber weapon. The highly advanced computer worm wreaked havoc on Iran’s nuclear enrichment program in 2010. 
CYBERCOM is currently involved in cyber attacks against the Islamic State, but Pentagon officials have been especially silent on the exact details of the “ cyber bombs ” being dropped on the terrorist group. Russia may find itself the next target, should it decide to go from misinformation campaigns to attacks on infrastructure.",0

The Rock, its “Sexiest Man Alive” for 2016, ushering him into an elite group of physically appealing men that over the years has included George Clooney, Matt Damon and David Beckham. The award is, of course, a naked public relations enterprise, bestowed upon a celebrity  —   often an actor  —   who is in the throes of promoting a new project. In Mr. Johnson’s case, that would be “Moana,” an animated Disney film, which will open in wide release on Nov. 23. He will also   in the eighth film of the “Fast and the Furious” franchise next year as well as in a remake of “Jumanji,” and he has been chronicling daily the filming process of that film on his Instagram account, which has nearly 70 million followers. Mr. Johnson told the magazine: “I’m not quite too sure where we go from here. I’ve done it all this is it. ” The magazine has been criticized for nearly always choosing a white man for the cover of this issue. But in Mr. Johnson, the magazine chose its first actor of Samoan heritage. (In interviews, Mr. Johnson has described himself as half black and half Samoan.) Denzel Washington was the first black actor to hold the title. Mr. Johnson, who is 44 and the father of two girls  —   Simone, 15, and Jasmine, 11 months  —   became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a performer with World Wrestling Entertainment. He turned toward Hollywood and found success with films like “The Mummy Returns” (2001) and a spinoff, “The Scorpion King” (2002). He joined the “Fast and the Furious” franchise in 2011 for its fifth film. This year, according to Forbes magazine, he became the world’s   actor. (It may be noteworthy that four of the Top 5 earners  —   Mr. Johnson, Mr. Damon, Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp  —   have each been People’s Sexiest Man Alive. It may also be noteworthy that with one exception, Kate Upton in 2014, the magazine does not traditionally name a “Sexiest Woman Alive. ”) “Remember, sexy isn’t something you ‘try and be.’ Sexy happens naturally when you’re comfortable just being yourself,” Mr. Johnson wrote on Instagram Tuesday when sharing the news. At    and 245 pounds, he is, physically, one of the largest men ever chosen by the magazine. Muscle and Fitness magazine once chronicled his daily diet at the height of his bodybuilding regimen: more than 5, 000 calories spread over seven meals, including a dozen eggs, a lot of cod and a steak. (In “Moana,” he voices the demigod Maui, a character that has been criticized as promoting negative stereotypes of Polynesians as overweight.) The actor is unabashedly populist in his career choices, telling British GQ last summer that he is “in the business of making movies for people, making content for people. ” “And that means people all over the world,” he continued. “Because as soon as you start thinking on a global scale, you are making more people happy, you are making more money, you are making the studios more money, you are making everybody happy. ” In that same interview, Mr. Johnson floated the idea of following the model set by Arnold Schwarzenegger, a fellow    and perhaps going into politics. “I can’t deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring,” he said. “And beyond that, it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on people’s lives on a global scale. ”",0

It’s not clear why so many employees are needed at the federal level. ” Trump has nominated Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma’s attorney general to serve as his EPA Director.

Miss Finland 2006 has become the 12th woman to accuse Donald Trump of sexual assault. Ninni Laaksonen claims the presidential candidate groped her while they took a picture together before an appearance on ‘The Late Show with David Letterman’ 10 years ago. 
Laaksonen, now 30, told Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat on Thursday that Trump groped her in New York in July 2006. A translation provided by the Daily Beast explains that the incident occurred when she and three other Miss Universe contestants were taking photos outside the Late Show studio. 
“ Trump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt, ” she said. “ I don’t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought, ‘What is happening?’ ” 
The beauty queen also attended parties at Trump’s residence with Melania, whom he had married one year prior to the incident. 
“ Somebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger ,” she told The Telegraph. 
Trump has vowed to sue all of his accusers, calling them “ horrible, horrible liars .” However, he may have a difficult time taking Laaksonen to court, as she currently lives in Finland where she runs Ninnin Lifestyle and Living, a beauty and cosmetic company.

21434,Tancredo: The Disgusting Media Double Standard Between Obama and Trump - Breitbart,"Pop quiz: Who said, “The Middle East is an issue that has obviously plagued the region for centuries”? No, it wasn’t Ross Perot, and it wasn’t Donald Trump. It was Barack Obama, the same man the White House press corps hailed as the smartest man to ever sit in the Oval Office. [The political bias of the establishment media has never been more outrageous than what we see in the press’s double standard for covering President Donald Trump. For contrasts that will make your head spin and your heart ache, compare Trump’s treatment to the press’s idolatrous treatment of President Obama.  The media’s   attitude toward Obama was unprecedented in the modern era. Not even handsome Jack Kennedy or war hero Eisenhower got the   treatment that Obama got. Obama’s frequent goofy statements and embarrassing gaffes were either overlooked entirely or treated as amusing sidebars. Will any historian ever catalog Obama’s frequent misstatements of elementary facts? How many do you remember? Here are few of the gems liberal historians will overlook: Such historical ignorance and efforts at personal   were routine for Obama  —    and never challenged by the working press. Obama’s hilarious mispronunciations and stupid asides were a regular feature of his speeches and interviews, at home and abroad. And yet, they did not tarnish his reputation in the White House press corps as a great intellectual and “perhaps the smartest man to ever sit in the Oval office. ” Oh, really? Now, compare the worshipful treatment of Obama to what Trump has experienced since winning the election on November 8. The establishment press won’t even accept the legitimacy of Trump’s election, much less the strong points of his policy initiatives. They won’t let go of the popular vote versus the Electoral College. That is not ignorance of Civics 101 it is part of a political strategy to demonize and delegitimize the entire Trump program. The media has openly joined the campaign by the Democratic Party and the “Social Justice” left to deny that President Trump has any policy mandates whatsoever. The narrative is this: since his presidency is illegitimate to begin with, it is okay to use violence to obstruct him at every point. Trump is justified and very smart to communicate with the American people directly and not expect the media to convey his messages fairly. Too many of them have become angry partisans in the left’s demonization strategy, and they need to be  . Conservatives and constitutionalists have seen media bias for half a century, and America has survived it. Yet, never has that bias and that vituperation been so uniform and vicious as what we see waged against President Trump. When it is coordinated with the   cultural bias in the entertainment and educational institutions, a triad of treachery emerges to challenge the very foundations of civic order.",0
21435,Man Burns Himself Trying to Start Fire Outside Trump D.C. Hotel,"A man was injured Tuesday night while attempting to start a fire outside the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D. C.[D. C. Fire and EMS was called at 9:23 p. m. to respond to a report that a man was setting himself on fire, CNN reported.  “We did arrive and did find a male adult with burns and we transported that patient to an area hospital with potential but not   burns,” DC Fire and EMS Department spokesman Vito Maggiolo told CNN Wednesday. The man suffered minor burns and was taken to a hospital for treatment, Fox News reported. The man, who told a reporter that he was from California, said he tried to set himself on fire “as an act of protest”: “We have a dictator that has been elected,” the unidentified man told WRC.

21436,Goldman Sachs CEO: Trump’s Executive Order on Immigration ’Not a Policy We Support’,"The CEO of Goldman Sachs has come out against President Trump’s executive order on immigration. [Lloyd Blankfein, the company’s CEO, told employees of the firm that the company does not support Trump’s policy and that it goes against the company’s principles.  “This is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court,” he said in a voicemail to employees, as reported by Business Insider. “If the order were to become or remain effective, I recognize that there is potential for disruption to the firm, and especially to some of our people and their families,” he said. “I want to assure all of you that we will work to minimize such disruption to the extent we can within the law and are focused on supporting our colleagues and their families who may be affected. ” Blankfein’s position against the order is noteworthy because several Goldman Sachs alumni have joined the Trump administration. Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s pick for treasury secretary, top economic adviser Gary Cohn, top adviser Anthony Scaramucci, and chief strategist Steve Bannon all had careers at Goldman, the Hill reported. Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, is not alone in his opposition to the President’s executive order. Ridesharing company Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union to fight against Trump’s executive order, while online residential lodging company AirBnB criticized the executive order and offered free housing Saturday to anyone who was stranded as a result of the travel ban, Breitbart News reported.",0

21442,Obamacare Architect Asked How to 'Fix' the Program. His Answer Reinforces Critics' Worst Fears.,"Share on Twitter 
With premiums set to spike dramatically in 2017, MIT economist and so-called Obamacare “architect” Jonathan Gruber shared his big idea to fix the struggling health care law during an interview on CNN Wednesday. 
“Once again, there’s no sense in which this has to be fixed. The law is working as designed, however it could work better,” Gruber said. “I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty.” 
So Gruber’s idea is to make it more expensive for people choosing to incur the “mandate penalty” in order to nudge them to enroll in Obamacare and take on higher premiums. The theory is that as more people enroll, the associated costs will go down. 
You might remember Gruber from a 2014 video in which he bragged about the Obama administration was able to take advantage of the “stupidity of the American voter” to get Obamacare passed. 
“Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,” he said in the video. “Call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to get anything to pass.” 
On several occasions, Gruber has been captured on video talking about exploiting American voters “lack of economic understanding.” 
The Obama administration admitted on Monday that Obamacare premiums for mid-level benchmark plans will increase by 25 percent on average across the country. Further, 20 percent of consumers will also have just one insurer to select from. 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has vowed to “repeal and replace” Obamacare with a new plan to provide ”great health care at a fraction of the cost.” He has offered few details on what that plan would entail. 
Hillary Clinton has promised to build on Obamacare and enact fixes rather than trashing the entire program. ",0
21444,‘The BFG’ Stumbles as ‘Finding Dory’ Rules Box Office - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   Hollywood’s   summer lineup continued to falter over the weekend, at least in North America, as two movies carrying a combined $500 million in production and global marketing costs arrived to $57. 7 million in total ticket sales. “The BFG,” directed by Steven Spielberg and released by Walt Disney Studios, was envisioned as a return to family form for the director  —   marketing materials reminded consumers that he made “E. T. ”  —   but it ended up as a colossal misfire. The movie, an   fantasy that drew appreciative reviews, took in about $19. 6 million Friday through Sunday, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Faring better was “The Legend of Tarzan. ” Starring Alexander Skarsgard as the   and made by Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow, “Tarzan” collected roughly $38. 1 million over the   period. That total was much higher than analysts predicted before release. Most critics turned up their noses, but audiences gave the film an   in CinemaScore exit polls, suggesting positive word of mouth. Even so, “Tarzan” remains squarely in the loser column when it comes to profitability. Loaded with visual effects  —   violent apes, stampeding wildebeests  —   the movie cost a   $180 million to make, not counting marketing. “This property has always really been about the international opportunity,” Jeff Goldstein, Warner’s executive vice president of domestic distribution, said by phone on Sunday. “You can best assess it a month from now. ” Directed by David Yates and   Margot Robbie, “Tarzan” opened in limited overseas release over the weekend, taking in $18. 8 million. Important markets like Britain and China are still to come. While acknowledging a “frustrating” result for “The BFG” at home, David Hollis, Disney’s distribution chief, also pointed to international audiences as a potential salvation for the movie, which is based on a book by Roald Dahl. “We’re really proud of the film,” Mr. Hollis said. “We’re going to be reliant in a lot of ways on international. ” So far, “The BFG” has opened in only two overseas markets, Russia and Australia. With “The BFG” collapsing in North America and “Tarzan” not exactly sizzling, the No. 1 movie on Hollywood’s home turf over the July Fourth weekend was again “Finding Dory. ” That sequel, from Disney’s Pixar division, took in an estimated $41. 9 million for a   domestic total of $372. 3 million. “Tarzan” was second. Third place went to “The Purge: Election Year” (Universal) a horror sequel that cost only $10 million to make and roughly $20 million to market. It sold a strong $30. 9 million in tickets. Blumhouse Productions, the   company behind the “Purge” series, has successfully kept this franchise going by pursuing different storytelling styles. The previous installment had action underpinnings this one added a political dimension. The summer box office always has ups and downs, but the current season has been much bumpier than usual. Disney has found two monster hits (“Finding Dory” and “Captain America: Civil War”) but has also suffered two major flops (“The BFG” and “Alice Through the Looking Glass”). Other   movies that have received a disappointing response from domestic audiences include “Independence Day: Resurgence,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows” and “Warcraft. ” An   on sequels has been one reason for Hollywood’s rough ride. But analysts have cautioned about overgeneralizing at the season’s midway point. Several movies ahead could still salvage the summer box office, including “The Secret Life of Pets,” “Ghostbusters” and “Suicide Squad. ”",0
21445,BUSTED: ABC News Staged Fake Crime Scene,"Share on Facebook ABC News has been caught staging a fake “crime scene” for reporter Linsey Davis to report from in a segment broadcast on Good Morning America. Viewers were presented with the sight of Davis standing in front of yellow police tape with the words “SHERIFF'S LINE DO NOT CROSS” and ABC News, reporting from the site for hours, claimed Davis was in the middle of an active crime scene. But she wasn't. The ABC News report had more in common with a Hollywood production than a breaking news report. Linsey Davis was actually standing in a field in Woodruffe, South Carolina – not at the crime scene she was claiming to be reporting from. Sources with knowledge of the matter say the sheriff's tape was placed there by the ABC News crew for the purpose of its inclusion in the live shot. A photo leaked by an anonymous source shows the sheriff's tape running no more than 30 yards – and tied at both ends to ABC News camera stands. Busted – and ABC know it. “This action is completely unacceptable and fails to meet the standards of ABC News,” said Julie Townsend, the vice president of communications at ABC News. “As soon as it was brought to our attention, we decided to take the producer out of the field, and we're investigating further.” Fake Sheriff's Tape, Fake News But ABC News' recent behavior gets even worse. While they are spending money and resources on faking crime scenes to set their viewers' pulses racing, they have also been exposed misleading their audience about real news. After ignoring the bombshell news that the FBI has been conducting an active investigation into the Clinton Foundation for more than a year, Good Morning America on Friday finally realized they couldn't continue ignoring the story without losing credibility. So they covered the story. But only for 40 seconds and only to dismiss it as “inaccurate and “unsubstantiated.” CBS This Morning's Major Garrett followed up by chiding “unconfirmed speculation.” On Good Morning America, correspondent Tom Llamas continued the misleading angle. “With just four days to go, Trump in full attack mode against Hillary Clinton, sending his crowds into a frenzy with these unsubstantiated reports ABC News sources say are inaccurate.” How can anybody trust these exposed liars anymore? Deceit and manipulation are fundamental to mainstream media operations these days. Sources: Cable News Network , Mashable Related:",0
21448,"Why ice ages occur every 100,000 years","Wed, 26 Oct 2016 03:20 UTC From CARDIFF UNIVERSITY Why does our planet experience an ice age every 100,000 years? Deep storage of carbon dioxide in the oceans may have triggered this unexplained phenomena, new research shows. © Lisieki and Raymo LR04 δ18O from Lisieki and Raymo (2005) correlated to the temperature anomaly inferred from the deuterium concentration in ice cores from EPICA Dome C, Antarctica (Jouzel et al., 2007). The main orbital (purple), tectonic (brown) and oceanic (blue) events are indicated (see the text for the references of each event). The orange box represents the start of the onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciations. 100 kyrs and 40 kyrs correspond to the orbitally-driven glacial/interglacial cycles period. This period changed from 41 kyrs to 100 kyrs during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition toward 1 Ma (MPT). click to enlarge Experts from Cardiff University have offered up an explanation as to why our planet began to move in and out of ice ages every 100,000 years. This mysterious phenomena, dubbed the '100,000 year problem', has been occurring for the past million years or so and leads to vast ice sheets covering North America, Europe and Asia. Up until now, scientists have been unable to explain why this happens. Our planet's ice ages used to occur at intervals of every 40,000 years, which made sense to scientists as the Earth's seasons vary in a predictable way, with colder summers occurring at these intervals. However there was a point, about a million years ago, called the 'Mid-Pleistocene Transition', in which the ice age intervals changed from every 40,000 years to every 100,000 years. New research published today in the journal Geology has suggested the oceans may be responsible for this change, specifically in the way that they suck carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere. By studying the chemical make-up of tiny fossils on the ocean floor, the team discovered that there was more CO2 stored in the deep ocean during the ice age periods at regular intervals every 100,000 years. This suggests that extra carbon dioxide was being pulled from the atmosphere and into the oceans at this time, subsequently lowering the temperature on Earth and enabling vast ice sheets to engulf the Northern Hemisphere. Lead author of the research Professor Carrie Lear, from the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, said: ""We can think of the oceans as inhaling and exhaling carbon dioxide, so when the ice sheets are larger, the oceans have inhaled carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, making the planet colder. When the ice sheets are small, the oceans have exhaled carbon dioxide, so there is more in the atmosphere which makes the planet warmer. ""By looking at the fossils of tiny creatures on the ocean floor, we showed that when ice sheets were advancing and retreating every 100,000 years the oceans were inhaling more carbon dioxide in the cold periods, suggesting that there was less left in the atmosphere."" Marine algae play a key role in removing CO2 from the atmosphere as it is an essential ingredient of photosynthesis. CO2 is put back into the atmosphere when deep ocean water rises to the surface through a process called upwelling, but when a vast amount of sea ice is present this prevents the CO2 from being exhaled, which could make the ice sheets bigger and prolong the ice age. ""If we think of the oceans inhaling and exhaling carbon dioxide, the presence of vast amounts of ice is like a giant gobstopper. It's like a lid on the surface of the ocean,"" Prof Lear continued. The Earth's climate is currently in a warm spell between glacial periods. The last ice age ended about 11,000 years ago. Since then, temperatures and sea levels have risen, and ice caps have retreated back to the poles. In addition to these natural cycles, manmade carbon emissions are also having an effect by warming the climate.",0
21450,Scientists Told To ‘Remain Silent’ On Glyphosate Cancer Findings,"The World Health Organization (WHO) have told scientists to stay silent on documents relating to the cancer-causing dangers associated with glyphosate. 
Via YourNewsWire 
In a letter, officials from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) warned scientists against disclosing information from a 2015 study that suggests that Monsanto’s weedkiller Roundup is carcinogenic.
The WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) distributed a report in early 2015 calling the weed killer “probably carcinogenic.” Makers of the product say the claim is false, citing their own research into the product.
Since then, several groups using Freedom of Information Laws have asked for documents related to how the IARC decision was made, including scientists on the panel that live and work in the U.S. at U.S. institutions. In response, the WHO said those documents pertaining to glyphosate research are private and its own property.
Reuters reports some parties are considering a lawsuit seeking to clarify whether that’s the case and if it’s subject to U.S. FOIA laws. Glyphosate is the key ingredient of Roundup, which is sold by Monsanto.

Wong identified the winning bidder as Hong Kong jewelry firm Chow Tai Fook. The company’s chairman, Henry Cheng   placed the winning bid over the phone, CNN Money reported. Wong said the company is not worried about a default this time because the auction house vetted the bidders, who also just so happen to have longstanding relationships with Sotheby’s.

Sonia Morales didn't hesitate for a moment when she was told that her unborn daughter would be born with a severe birth defect. While doctors suggested she terminate the pregnancy, Sonia knew she had been given a gift. 
And when online strangers make hateful comments about her daughter now, Sonia has the perfect response. Loading Facebook Post... 
As WJLA News reports, Sonia was 16 weeks pregnant when she learned that her child had anencephaly. Her daughter would be born without a portion of her brain, skull, and scalp. 
Doctors predicted that the baby would survive a few hours or days, but Sonia refused to consider abortion. She tells WJLA: 
“God made no mistake giving Angela to Rony, Elizabeth, and I. He chose us for this sacred task and we said yes to his calling. We made the commitment even before her birth. We will take care of her the rest of her life here on earth.” 
Sonia and her family welcomed baby Angela on March 23, 2014. Sonia began working to raise awareness about anencephaly, creating a Facebook page about her daughter and her “miraculous journey.” Loading Facebook Post... 
With the internet being what it is, however, it was only a matter of time before the horrible remarks came trickling in. 
Quite a few commenters wrote about how they thought Angela was less than human. Some even suggested that Sonia would be doing her daughter a favor if she ended Angela's life. 
Sonia says that the hateful messages bring tears to her eyes, but that she tries to move past them. However, one comment in particular drove her to respond. She recounts on Facebook what one poster wrote: 
“Angela looks less attractive now that she is growing and gaining weight.” 
Sonia decided to reply for the daughter who could not. After pointing out that beauty lies within, she writes: 
“I know that Angela looks different from my typical child, but she is beautiful just the way she is. ... She is full of grace and has great peace despite the struggles. She is a radiant light in the darkness in this materialistic and shallow culture that defines beauty in the pleasure of interests. She is a true picture of strength; she is a precious little girl with a beautiful soul. So this statement does not define whom Angela IS, it defines who YOU really are!” 
In response to those who hold her daughter's life cheap, Sonia only says that they can't know what it's like to enjoy her daughter's smiles and laughter. She tells WJLA: 
""Even if her life does not please some people, we can’t play God and assume the right to dictate who should live and die. If you get to spend five minutes with her, you will see that she is perfect the way she is.” 
Now two years old, Angela has defied expectations, and her family says that they are blessed to have her with them for as long as they can. Loading Facebook Post... 
After seeing how her daughter has been an inspiration to so many, Sonia knows exactly how meaningless the harsh words from strangers are. She tells NBC10 News : 
“It is so amazing to see how many lives Angela has touched around the world. She hasn't said a word, but her testimony of life and love has reached more than 50 countries. God chose Angela before she was even born. She might never walk or talk or go to school or run a marathon, but she has done more than I have ever done in my entire life.” 
And despite the negative comments, Sonia knows that she gets to spend her days with a miracle. ",0

Scenes at Cannon Ball in North Dakota are turning increasingly ugly as peaceful protestors continue to clash with riot police and the National Guard. The protest concerns the planned drilling in the area to build a gas pipeline. 
The Standing Rock Sioux tribe have spoken out against the plans as they will run through a sacred burial ground in violation of Native American treaties. They have found support and partnership with environmental activists who do not believe that the United States government should be creating new fossil fuel infrastructure. Militarized police tactics escalate at Standing Rock 
Despite the fact that the United Nation has called on the American government to cease construction, the government shows no signs of abating their plans. Instead, they have turned their attention to a brutal crackdown on the protestors. According to a journalist, an activist Erin Schrode, protestors have been maced, beaten with batons, subject to Taser fire and been shot with rubber bullets. 
I can’t believe what is happening here in Standing Rock. It’s a scene like I’ve never seen anywhere else in the world, and it’s right here at home. 
Schrode herself had conducted an interview on camera when she was shot with a rubber bullet. In a post on her Facebook profile, she claims that while she was physically unhurt, she was shaken by the attack and simply could not understand why she had been targeted in such a violent way. In an interview with Fusion she said; 
I couldn’t fathom that I’d just been hit. Why would they target me? Why would they shoot anyone? There was absolutely nothing violent, aggressive, provocative going on at the protests yesterday. 
This entire disturbing incident was caught on camera which Schrode has shared on her Twitter feed. The full video can be viewed here: 
The use of rubber bullets for crowd control has been outlawed in most places in the developed world owing to the number of fatalities and serious injuries they caused when deployed in the long-running conflict in Northern Ireland. Their use in situations without the threat of serious violence is practically unheard of. But despite this unprecedented level of police brutality, the protestors at Standing Rock are not intimidated and will refuse to leave the protest site until construction has ceased or they are forced off the land .

21459,El Cajon Police Release Video of Fatal Shooting - The New York Times,"The authorities in El Cajon, Calif. on Friday released video footage of an officer fatally shooting an unarmed black man, as part of an effort to quell what has been growing unrest in the community since the episode on Tuesday. The footage shed little new light on what happened to the man, Alfred Olango, 38. The video came from two perspectives  —   one from a civilian’s cellphone and the other from a surveillance camera at a   window at a taco shop. In both videos, the faces and heads of the officers and Mr. Olango were blurred to appear as gray dots. Also, both videos were taken from a distance. The   surveillance video shows the scene before the shooting and as a patrol car arrived. The second video shows Mr. Olango walking toward an officer and then walking away backward and sideways as the officer approaches. The officer and Mr. Olango, facing each other, then move side to side in tandem six times before a second officer appears. Multiple shots are fired, and a woman can then be heard screaming. The angle and distance of the videos made it difficult to see clearly what happened because one of the officers was standing in front of Mr. Olango when the shooting happened. The police previously said they responded to a report of a person acting “erratically. ” Mr. Olango refused “multiple instructions” by the first officer to remove his hand from his pocket, the police said in a news release on Tuesday. The officer drew his weapon and pointed it at Mr. Olango while continuing to direct him to take his hand out of his pocket. A second officer arrived and prepared to use an electronic control device. As Mr. Olango paced and the officers tried to talk to him, he “rapidly drew an object from his front pants pocket, placed both hands together and extended them rapidly toward the officer taking up what appeared to be a shooting stance,” the police said. The object he pointed was a silvery vape smoking device with a    cylinder, the police said. At that point, the officer with the electronic control device discharged his weapon, the police said. Simultaneously, the officer with the firearm discharged his weapon several times, striking Mr. Olango. No gun was found. Mr. Olango’s mother said during an emotional news conference on Thursday that her son was having a mental breakdown when he was confronted by the police at the taco shop, Reuters reported. The shooting has touched off days of growing unrest and violence in El Cajon, a suburb of San Diego. On Thursday night, about 75 protesters gathered near the scene of the shooting and threw rocks, bricks and bottles at officers, broke windows and jumped on cars, the El Cajon police chief, Jeff Davis, said at the news conference. A San Diego police officer was struck on the head with a brick, the chief said. The officer was not seriously hurt. Four demonstrators were charged with unlawful assembly and one was charged with assault with a deadly weapon for the episode with the officer. The chief was joined at the news conference by religious and civic leaders who said they wanted the community to move forward in peace. Bonnie Dumanis, the San Diego County district attorney, said that the shooting was under investigation and that “no decision has been made” about filing charges. Chief Davis said the department released the footage in the interest of public safety because protests had shifted from peaceful to more violent over the past days. “This is a difficult situation as any law enforcement officer will encounter and not one we seek,” the chief said.",0

People laughed at me when I said back in April, that Paul Ryan would be your next President. How could I be so sure, because he would not actively campaign and endorse anyone, in a meaningful way during the Republican Primary. He filed paperwork to run for President on January 30, 2016. And he is a Clintonista, a globalist, a traitor to the American people. He doesn’t carry the criminal baggage of Clinton, but he supports all free trade agreements, the elimination of all national borders, the weakening of our military. etc., etc. 
Paul Ryan represents the globalists and their Plan B since Hillary Clinton is going to be indicted AFTER the election. 
Please watch the following video and you will see the inescapable conclusion that Hillary Clinton is no longer useful to the globalists and Ryan’s lack of a criminal record , whose election will not spark rioting in the streets from 50% of Americans who do not know any better, and who will do what he is told by the Rothschild/Rockefeller cartel.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — The United Kingdom is interested in a strong energy sector as an economic driver for the whole British economy, and consequently in the stabilization of prices on the global oil market, Charles Hendry , a former UK Minister for Energy and Climate Change, told Sputnik on Wednesday. ""Oil consumers have enjoyed low oil prices, that's been good, but ultimately we need strong oil and gas sector because the economic driver which it creates and provides. So for the United Kingdom we have seen both the upside and the downside. … There is a beginning consensus of people [in the United Kingdom] recognizing that action needs to be taken [to stabilize oil market],"" Hendry said.

21462,New O’Keefe Video: Leftists Plan to Blockade Trump Inauguration,"James O’Keefe and Project Veritas released a new undercover video on Tuesday showing   activists with the “DisruptJ20” effort plotting to stop Donald Trump’s inauguration by chaining D. C. Metro trains and blocking roads. [The video adds a layer of deep detail to a story by Ryan Lovelace in the Washington Examiner earlier this month, “How protesters plan to wreck Donald Trump’s inauguration,” which first reported the efforts of “#DisruptJ20. ”  One activist leader is captured on the Project Veritas video saying: “So simultaneous to the checkpoint blockades in the morning, we are also doing a series of clusterfuck blockades, where we are going to try to blockade all the major ingress points into the city. ” The blockade plan allegedly included stopping the D. C. Metro, according to an audio recording: So we figured out this, um, the trains pull up, one person is going to lock one end of a chain to an edge, and on the other end of the chain the end of the car, so on and so forth, done. It takes 15 seconds and everyone can leave and literally it can’t go anywhere at that point, its anchored. And you can use a really thin chain  —   you don’t need a heavy chain  —   that would require like a bolt cutter to undo, basically to shut down that line   …     Metro Center, Gallery Place, and L’Enfant Plaza, they are all close enough to walk to and that’s every single line in the city. Another plan allegedly involved using setting up tables, ostensibly for distributing charitable donations for the poor and homeless, to block roads to the inauguration: “So, we want to encourage you all to give to the poor and the homeless. Go right down to 2nd and D, help us to block the vehicle traffic and the pedestrian traffic flowing to the inauguration. And set up tables, food, give out whatever,  right there, there 2nd and D a block from either direction and help to block traffic. ” One of the more creative plans apparently discussed was to move protesters into position near a park by posing as members of a yoga class. Other apparent discussions involved violent tactics to use in street battles with police. One activist expresses the desire to see the inauguration moved inside because of the protests. The Project Veritas video is Part Two of a series on   protests of the inauguration. Part One, released on Monday, showed activists planning to set off stink bombs at an   party. Joel B.

21463,"Life: Move Over, SoulCycle: This Spin Studio Motivates Its Students By Hooking Up Each Bike To A Sick Child’s Life Support","Email 
If you’re always making excuses to skip the gym, you’ve got to check this out. 
Let’s be honest: We all can use a little extra push to get the most out of our workouts. Now, there’s one spin studio that has a brand-new approach to take motivation to the next level. At SpinZone NYC, they’ve got a great new twist to keep riders active and focused the whole 45 minutes: Every one of their bikes is hooked up to a sick child’s life support. 
Too cool! Where do we sign up??? 
If you thought spin class was intense before, just wait until you see this setup. With 16 bikes, each hooked up to the equipment needed to keep one child alive, there’s no doubt that every bit of effort counts—if you stop pedaling, the machines stop, too. Even with the array of pulsing lights and music we’ve come to expect from spin class, the distinct sound of an EKG flatlining on a 7-year-old can be a powerful motivator to let riders know it’s time to step things up. 
In an increasingly competitive fitness market, the innovative approach at SpinZone NYC is a breath of fresh air, and it’s winning them new customers left and right. With no backup generators and no excuses, they’ve created exactly the kind of environment people need to get real results. Instructors are always there to offer a word of encouragement and remind cyclists how severe their child’s condition is. And forget about plateauing—once participants make it through a full session with one sick kid, that just means a bigger and sicker child for the next workout. 
“I used to make it 30 minutes, tops,” said Erika Perry, a regular who says she never breaks eye contact with her kid for extra motivation to keep going. “Now I regularly make it the full class. There’s something about a child depending on me for survival that really gets me going in the morning. And I’ve dropped 11 pounds and feel great!” 
Wow, it sounds like things are off to a great start! If this catches on, it’s exactly the kind of bold idea that can transform an entire industry. Way to go, SpinZone NYC. Keep on pedaling!",0
21470,Job Creation Slumps in May - Breitbart,"Job creation slowed down in May, with total nonfarm payrolls increasing by 138, 000 while unemployment was little changed at 4. 3 percent.

The number of unemployed at 6. 9 million and the unemployment rate of 4. 3 percent were nearly unchanged from the prior month. Since January, the unemployment rate has fallen by a half a percentage point and the number of unemployed has declined by 774, 000.  Labor force participation declined   of a percent to 62. 7 percent, near the lowest levels since the 1970s. The unemployment rate for whites declined slightly to 3. 7 percent in May. The jobless rate for Asians was 3. 6 percent, for Hispanics 5. 2 percent and for blacks 7. 5 percent. Payrolls grew in health care and mining. Health care added 24, 000 jobs, while mining jobs grew by 7, 000. Employment in restaurants and bars grew by 38, 000. (Amusing aside: the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls bars “drinking places” in its official releases.) Part time jobs grew by 113, 000, while full time jobs fell by 367, 000. Much of the jobs created in May were in   occupations. Prior months were revised downward. March nonfarm payroll growth came down to 50, 000 from 79. 000. April fell to 174, 000 from 211, 000. The report would appear to support the arguments of President Donald Trump and others that the economy is still running too slowly and would benefit from fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts.

The US military forces have secretly been using an airbase in Tunisia for drone operations to gather intelligence from inside oil-rich Libya, officials say. 
The announcement was made by unnamed sources cited in a Washington Post report on Wednesday. 
Libya has been struggling to contain the Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who started expanding their presence in the country following the overthrow and death of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011. 
The base has apparently been in use since late June in an alleged effort to support the Libyan government’s fight against the terrorists currently in control of the northern city of Sirte. 
The US has also been using bases in Niger and Djibouti but those ones are farther away.

21483,’Merkel’s Migrants’: Germany’s Rejected Asylum Seekers Flood Paris,"Migrants rejected for asylum by Germany are flooding into the French capital Paris, leaving some migrant centres almost completely full. [Between 50 and 100 rejected asylum seekers are entering France per day, according to figures from Europe 1 Le JDD, causing a new headache for the country’s authorities and creating a defining issue for the forthcoming presidential election.  Berlin registered some 280, 000 asylum claims in 2016, although over 700, 000 are still being processed. Of these, 162, 510 were filed by Syrians and 127, 892 by Afghans. The vast majority of Syrians receive asylum status if they can prove their identity. However, one out of every two asylum applications from Afghans get rejected. Those rejected migrants, instead of waiting to be deported, then try their luck in a different country. A   asylum centre opened by Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo in November is already    and the city has announced the creation of another 200 places to cope with demand. Authorities have been sounding the alarm for the past few days as makeshift camps begin forming in the streets again. Breitbart London reported in November how Paris’s migrant slums were hotbeds of crime, as gangs fought one another on the city’s streets. Many of migrants had originally travelled to the city after authorities dismantled the infamous “Jungle” camp in Calais, with large numbers gathering in the Stalingrad district. Footage from April 2016 shows the Stalingrad camp explode in violence as massive riot erupted between over 1, 000 people. Despite being officially broken up, authorities are concerned that the camp and others like it will reform as the new wave of rejected asylum seekers travels across the border from Germany. One local resident said in November: “The stench of urine, faeces, and rubbish has made Stalingrad an unhealthy place to live. The place is dead, no one wants to come here anymore.

“We are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era,” said Dr. Cornel West , the nation’s most prominent Black public intellectual, assessing the import of last week’s election. West backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, then endorsed the Green Party’s presidential ticket. The election “did not go left-populist, following Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein,” he said. Instead, “it went rightwing-fascist. But the neoliberal era is coming to a close and the neoliberal establishment is being exposed. The issues of class now are becoming much more central.” Trump Supporters Mounted an “Insurrection” 
Duboisian scholar Dr. Anthony Monteiro was among the few observers on the Left that thought Donald Trump would win at the polls. But, even he was startled at the scope of Trump’s sweep. “I felt that the insurgency would grow and deepen, but I never thought that it would become an insurrection,” said Monteiro. “In a certain sense, white working and poor people in these small, rust belt towns have a sense of achievement in having brought the Clintons down that Black people had in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected with a huge Black turnout,” he said. Monteiro is one of the organizers of a Conference on Political Science for Radical Times, set for December 9-10, in Philadelphia. TPP “On Its Death Bed” 
With Donald Trump’s victory, President Obama’s Trans Pacific Partnership corporate rights trade deal is “looking like it’s on its death bed,” said Kevin Zeese , of Popular Resistance. “We’ve worked for five years to make TPP stand for Toxic Political Poison, and that seems to have happened,” said Zeese. Trump won in “the rust belt that was destroyed by NAFTA” -- Bill Clinton’s jobs-exporting bill of a generation ago -- “and was going to be threatened again by TPP.” Zeese said Obama may make a last bid to pass TPP in the lame duck session of Congress that begins this week. Finally, a Practical Guide to Black Self-Determination 
The Black is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations adopted a 19-point Black Political Agenda for Self-Determination, at a conference in Washington. The document applies the principle of self-determination to the broadest range of issues, from Black Community Control of the Police, to Mass Black Incarceration, to Nationalization of the Banks. “Everybody wants self-determination,” said Coalition chairman Omali Yeshitela , “but what does it mean, practically?” The 19 points give direction to the struggle. “This isn’t something you work on every four years,” said Yeshitela. “This is something you work on every day. This is our program.” 
Margaret Kimberley , an editor and senior columnist for Black Agenda Report, told the conference: “When we meet together, today, we are showing the world what self-determination looks like.” Voting for “your enemies” is not self-determination, and “thinking that electoral politics is the only road to liberation is not self-determination,” said Kimberley.

21486,Trump Halts U.S. Funding of United Nations Population Fund,"President Trump’s administration is ending U. S. funding of the United Nations Population Fund  —   an agency that human rights activists have linked to the support of population control programs such as China’s coercive abortion “  policy. ”[The halt to the funding of the United Nations Population Fund  —   known as UNFPA  —   comes as Trump is scheduled this week to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the president’s    resort in Florida.  In January, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the “Mexico City Policy,” which concerns U. S. aid for abortions overseas. The president updated the policy by directing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to implement a plan that expands the policy across all global health assistance funding. The directive means that U. S. taxpayer dollars will no longer be supporting organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program, such as that espoused by China. A report by the Associated Press states that as a result of the end of U. S. funding of UNFPA, $32. 5 million will shift to the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) which has the goal of reducing maternal deaths and practices such as genital mutilation. As Breitbart News reported in December 2015, Rep. Chris Smith ( )   of the Congressional Executive Committee on China, observed during a hearing, “The Chinese government is not the only one culpable in these heinous crimes against women and children. The UN Population Fund helped fund birth restrictions, fund forced abortions, and a massive and coercive family planning bureaucracy. ” “The UNFPA whitewashed China’s crimes for decades and continues to do so today,” the congressman continued, adding that on its website UNFPA “justifies its history in China, saying it was ‘tasked by the Executive Committee’ to help China and had to ‘engage with China as a sovereign nation. ’” More than a year ago, China announced that it had switched to a “  policy,” one that Smith said only continues the country’s longstanding attempts to control family life: The “  policy” may possibly become a “  policy” but China’s police state population control policies will not end anytime soon. The Chinese government retains the power to tell couples what their families must look like and the power to punish those who disobey birth quotas. For the past 35 years the Chinese government has wasted precious human potential and sanctioned   violence against women and children —  enabled by   groups globally and the United Nations Population Fund. No one should applaud China’s announced “ ” policy instead we should be insisting they abolish intrusive and abusive birth restrictions forever.

21488,HIDDEN CAM: FBI Botched First Clinton Investigation – Why Trust Them Now?,"We Are Change 
The FBI is on round two of their investigation into the emails sent and received by Hillary Clinton on her private server, and a recently released undercover video serves as a reminder of everything that was wrong with the initial investigation. It all starts with who they did and did not interview.
In March 2015, reports first surfaced revealing that Clinton did not have a government email address, and opted to use her personal address during her tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Reports then concluded that her private address was linked to a private server at her home in Chappaqua, New York.
However, the FBI did not publicly admit that they were conducting an investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information until June 2016, when FBI general counsel James Baker sent a letter to the State Department confirming that there was, in fact, an “ongoing investigation.” 
The public knowledge of Clinton’s email practices came about because she was already being investigated by the House Select Committee on Benghazi for her involvement in the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghzi, Libya.
Despite the fact that a former Secretary of State who was already being investigated , admitted that she used a private server for government business, and then told the public that she deleted 33,000 emails, the FBI still waited nearly a year to confirm that they were conducting an investigation into her email practices.
According to a recent video from Project Veritas, the FBI’s initial investigation into Clinton’s email was not nearly as thorough as it should have been.
The undercover report revealed that State Department IT Systems Administrator Cindy Almodovar knew of Clinton’s email practices in 2010, and even “met with Huma Abedin for 30 minutes regarding emails at the then unknown, but now notorious, @clintoneail.com site.” 
However, Almodovar claims in the video that she was never interviewed by the FBI in connection with their investigation, despite the fact that her name was mentioned in the emails and her knowledge of Clinton’s practices was clear.
While the FBI failed to interview Almodovar, they did manage to interview Clinton’s close confidante and top aide: Huma Abedin.
At the time, Adedin swore under oath that she turned in all of the “all of the devices” she owned that contained State Department emails. However, the FBI now claims to have found “tens of thousands” of emails belonging to Abedin on the laptop of her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. Weiner is currently being investigated for engaging in a sexual relationship with an underage girl.
Some sources have said that Clinton is “likely to be indicted” this time around, but this comes after FBI Director James Comey laid out of all of the reasons Clinton should have been arrested in the first investigation, and then ultimately defended her.
Why should we trust that Comey and the FBI will get it right this time around? With all of the recent revelations from WikiLeaks and Project Veritas coming together, it serves as a reminder that it’s not just about Clinton this time. It is not about both Hillary Clinton and the entire FBI being held accountable for their actions.

21489,‘Hidden Figures’ Ties ‘Rogue One’ at Box Office - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   It was a surprise photo finish at the weekend box office, with the   drama “Hidden Figures” and “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” each selling an estimated $22 million in tickets at North American theaters. Most analysts had expected “Rogue One” (Disney) to easily repeat as the No. 1 multiplex attraction. The “Star Wars” spinoff has now collected about $477. 3 million over four weeks. Overseas, it has taken in another $437 million. But in its first weekend in wide release “Hidden Figures” (20th Century Fox) about unsung black heroines in the NASA space race of the 1960s, was lifted by strong reviews, an aggressive   marketing campaign that included a   appeal to faith audiences, and attention on Hollywood’s annual awards circuit. Fox said “Hidden Figures,” directed by Theodore Melfi and starring Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monáe, did particularly well in San Francisco, Washington, Chicago and Cleveland. Produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films for about $25 million, after accounting for tax credits, “Hidden Figures” received an   grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls. The movie was most popular with women (64 percent of the audience) and people over the age of 35 (about 56 percent of attendees). The animated musical “Sing” (Universal) was next in line, taking in about $20 million, for a   domestic total of $213. 4 million. The weekend’s other new   movie, “Underworld: Blood Wars” (Sony) only managed $13 million in ticket sales, or nearly 50 percent less than the initial results for its 2012 franchise predecessor. Sony noted that “Blood Wars” also cost half as much to make  —   about $35 million  —   and has already taken in $45 million overseas. Sony also blamed winter storms in the Eastern United States for decreasing turnout. Among specialty releases: “Manchester by the Sea” (Roadside Attractions) sold about $2. 5 million in tickets in 1, 054 theaters, lifting its total to $34 million “Patriots Day” (CBS Films and Lionsgate) about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, had $105, 000 in seven locations, ahead of its nationwide release on Friday.",0
21492,"If You Live HERE, Forget Christmas Lights – They’ve Been BANNED to Avoid “Offending Refugees”","0 comments 
Perhaps no country has been more welcoming of Muslims refugees to their own detriment than Sweden. 
Not only has the country accepted far more of these migrants than they can feasibly handle, but the nation has also bent over backwards to make them comfortable. Things have gotten so out of hand that Christmas lights have now been banned so as not to offend these devout Muslims. 
The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages this year, which means that many towns will have no lights at all for the holiday. 
What a sad time for the native Christians in Sweden. 
To add insult to injury, Speisa called the decision “a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the country’s Christian traditions.” 
Shockingly, even though the onslaught of Islamic culture has wreaked havoc on Sweden’s people and infrastructure, they want to “tone down” the Christian influence. How backwards is that?! 
Authorities appear to be trying to sweep the decision under the rug by claiming it is a matter of “safety.” 
“Poles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there,” said Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator at the Swedish Transport Administration. 
I’m not sure they’re going to be fooling anyone with this “safety” line. If they were really so worried about that, they wouldn’t be allowing millions of migrants to roam around raping their women and children. 
MRC Blog expressed the same sentiment: 
This argument that lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk is complete [sic] bogus, of course. Authorities in Sweden actually expect people to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles. In reality, these lights have simply been banned to avoid offending Muslim “refugees.” 
You can be sure that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we have a future similar to Sweden’s to look forward to. She has privately expressed her desire for completely open borders and she kowtows to Muslims the same way President Obama does. 
SHARE this report if you think it is utterly absurd that Sweden has banned Christmas lights to appease Muslim refugees!",0

21495,NYT: Populist Steve Bannon Reassures Conservatives Uneasy About Trump,"The New York Times’ Jeremy Peters writes that Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon “offered a message of soothing reassurance to the conservative activists” at the annual CPAC conference on Thursday. Bannon’s reputation, Peters writes, “has taken on almost mythic proportion as a   populist, emerging power center, man of mystery. ”[From the New York Times:  [Bannon] urged a ballroom full of activists to stick together against the forces that were trying to tear them apart. “Whether you’re a populist, whether you’re a   conservative, whether you’re a libertarian, whether you’re an economic nationalist,” he said, “we want you to have our back. ” Despite Mr. Bannon’s assurances, a simmering unease remains among conservatives over whether Mr. Trump will honor his promises to them, given that he was not part of their movement  —   or any political movement, for that matter  —   until very recently. Not too many years ago CPAC almost denied Mr. Trump a speaking slot because it feared he only wanted to promote himself. As for Mr. Bannon, he was essentially banished from the premises when he was running Breitbart News. So Mr. Bannon started a rival conference at a hotel down the street and called it The Uninvited.

21497,Comey: AG Lynch Directed Me to Call Hillary Email Investigation a ‘Matter’ - Breitbart,"Comey says Clinton, Lynch tarmac meeting convinced him, ”in an ultimately conclusive way” to go public with email probe. pic. twitter.  Thursday during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, former FBI Director James Comey said former Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch had asked him to call the FBI investigation into former Secretary of State and   presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information on a private email server a “matter. ”  Comey said, “There were other things that contributed to that. One significant item I can’t. I know the committee’s been briefed on. There’s been public accounts of it which are nonsense. But I understand the committee has been briefed on the classified facts. Probably the only other consideration I guess can talk about in an open setting is at one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it an investigation but instead to call it matter, which confused me and concerned me. But that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if we’re to close this case credibly. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
21498,Offizieller Friseur des Weißen Hauses erlitt am Wahlabend Nervenzusammenbruch,"Donnerstag, 10. November 2016 Offizieller Friseur des Weißen Hauses erlitt am Wahlabend Nervenzusammenbruch Washington, D.C. (dpo) - Zu einem tragischen Zwischenfall ist es während der US-Präsidentschaftswahl am Dienstagabend in Washington gekommen. Wie erst heute bekannt wurde, musste der Friseur des US-Präsidenten kurz nach Bekanntgabe der ersten Wahlergebnisse ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert. Die Pressestelle des Weißen Hauses bestätigte den Vorfall. Demnach ging Arthur McMellow, der seit 31 Jahren im Amtssitz des Staatsoberhauptes für den perfekten Look der präsidialen Haarpracht zuständig ist, voller Euphorie zu einer Wahlparty in den Keller des Weißen Hauses, wo auch andere Mitarbeiter den Verlauf der Wahl verfolgten. ""Anfangs war er wie wir alle sehr zuversichtlich und freute sich auf die Nacht"", erinnert sich der Chefkoch des Weißen Hauses, der ebenfalls anwesend war. ""Arthur hatte sich vorsorglich schon mit Material für blonde Strähnchen eingedeckt und war guter Dinge."" Sind es politische Differenzen mit seinem künftigen Chef, die McMellow zu schaffen machten? Als gegen Mitternacht immer klarer wurde, dass Trump auf Obama folgen würde, sei die Stimmung zwar etwas gekippt, ""aber alle Beschäftigten des Weißen Hauses blieben ruhig und professionell"", wie einer der Gärtner berichtet. ""Nur Arthur wurde immer fahriger und lauter, das ist sonst gar nicht seine Art."" Normalerweise gilt McMellow in seinem Umfeld als sehr ausgeglichener Mensch, der seinen Job liebt und ihn mit Leidenschaft ausfüllt. Doch der 56-Jährige ließ sich nicht mehr beruhigen: Gegen ein Uhr morgens alarmierte der Leibarzt von Präsident Obama den Notruf. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt lag McMellow in Fötusstellung wimmernd am Boden. Inzwischen liegt er in einem Washingtoner Krankenhaus und befindet sich auf dem Weg der Besserung. Bekannte erklärten, McMellow plane, schnellstmöglich seine Stelle kündigen und in einen nervlich weniger fordernden Job wie etwa Löwendompteur zu wechseln. pfg; Foto oben: Shutterstock [M]; Foto unten: Michael Vadon , CC BY-SA 4.0 Artikel teilen:",0
21499,Donald Trump: Chuck Schumer ’Leading Democrats to Doom’ - Breitbart,"During his speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump attacked Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) describing him as a “bad leader” who is “leading the Democrats to doom. ”[Discussing the opposition from Democrats to his plans to build a border wall, Trump said, “Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress have no leadership, they are rudderless. ”  “Senator Schumer is a bad leader. I’ve known him a long time, Senator Schumer is a bad leader, not a natural leader at all. He works hard to study leadership   …     Well if you have to study leadership you’ve got problems,” Trump said. “His policies are hurting innocent Americans and making it easier for drug dealers to enter our country. Schumer is weak on crime and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. He is a poor leader, and he is leading the Democrats to doom,” Trump continued. Trump also criticized Democrats in Congress for opposing his immigration agenda, arguing that “If the Democrats knew what the hell they were doing, they would approve [the wall] so fast, as we want to stop crime in our country. ” He said: Obviously they don’t mind illegals coming in, they don’t mind drugs pouring in, they don’t mind MS13 coming in. Members of Congress who’ll be voting on border security have a simple choice, they can either help to vote drug cartels and criminal aliens trying to enter the United States, like frankly, the Democrats are doing. Or they can vote to help American citizens and American families be safe, that’s the choice. In March, Sen. Chuck Schumer claimed that Trump’s plans to build a wall on the southern border would not get sufficient votes from Democrats or Republicans, as “It’s not the best way to protect the border” and “It’s very expensive. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
21500,"Report: Hillary, 6 Aides Had Access to Classified State Dept Info After Leaving Office - Breitbart","Hillary Clinton and 6 aides had access to classified State Department information after she left office, lawmaker says | @edhenry pic. twitter.  Friday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” network correspondent Ed Henry reported Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) had revealed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential nominee for the Democratic Party, and six of her aides retained their access to top secret and classified information after leaving the State Department in 2013.  “We’re learning from Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that she and six staffers in 2013 retained clearances where they still had access to top secret and classified information,” Henry said. “Why? They were titled ‘research assistants.’ So the assumption on Capitol Hill is it was because she was writing her memoirs and saying, ‘Look, I still need access to this information in order to go through what happened in Syria, what happened with Russia. But obviously think back to what James Comey said in how Hillary Clinton handled classified information. ” Henry was referring to Comey’s July 2016 statement calling Clinton “extremely careless” in how she handled classified information. “He obviously believes something needs to be done about this,” Henry added. “The only positive for Chuck Grassley at this point is, there’s no longer a Democrat at the State Department, obviously. You got Rex Tillerson, so if you have these documents on why she retained these clearances, and for example does she still have a clearance today? A lot of former officials get to keep these clearances for years  —   when they’re consultants   …     some of them like to retain it because they say I was in the middle of all of these important issues. I need to keep abreast of it. Been then some of these folks in Washington  —   they say drain the swamp. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
21502,The Loophole That Could Cost Donald Trump the Nomination - The New York Times,"Pennsylvania, which holds its primary next Tuesday, uses a nonbinding “loophole” primary  —   and that could cost Donald Trump the Republican nomination. If the state adopted the delegate rules of any other primary, he would probably be an   favorite, or better, to amass the 1, 237 delegates needed before the convention. Instead, his chances may come down to the whims of 54 unpledged Pennsylvania delegates. No other state leaves so many of its delegates unbound  —   allowed to vote for whomever they please at the convention. That’s because it conducts its loophole primary in two parts. First is the “beauty contest,” which is a presidential primary preference vote. The winner of the beauty contest gets all of Pennsylvania’s 17   and bonus delegates. But the remaining 54  —   the three delegates awarded to each congressional district  —   are unbound and elected in the delegate selection primary. In this part, voters directly elect delegates to the national convention. What makes Pennsylvania’s G. O. P. delegate selection primary so distinctive is that the ballot includes no guidance on whom a delegate will support at the national convention (the prospective Democratic delegates commit to a candidate). A voter will just see a list of names  —   some of whom might be recognizable, but others might as well be Joe Schmo. (It’s called a loophole primary because it could circumvent the delegate allocation rules. Voters could, in theory, elect a slate of delegates who unanimously support one candidate, even in cases where a    contest was prohibited.) The result is that Pennsylvania, with the   G. O. P. delegates of any state, ranks 49th in pledged delegates. It’s behind even Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. The other two states with loophole primaries  —   West Virginia and Illinois  —   take a somewhat different approach: The delegates pledge whom they’ll support, and their preferences are listed alongside their names on the ballot. When you read articles about whether Mr. Trump can reach 1, 237 pledged delegates by the convention, these 54 delegates are held out of the analysis. Mr. Trump would be favored to win a majority of Pennsylvania’s 71 delegates under any other primary system. He leads by at least nine percentage points in every survey in the state, and is ahead of Ted Cruz by an average of 44 percent to 28 percent, according to The Huffington Post Pollster. He’s up by a similar margin of 46 percent to 30 percent in The Upshot’s   model. Our model gives him an edge in 15 of the state’s 18 congressional districts. In a standard proportional allocation, Mr. Trump would probably be on track to win at least 40 of the state’s delegates. In a    system, like Indiana’s or California’s, Mr. Trump would be favored to win at least 60 delegates. The difference matters a lot because Mr. Trump’s prize of 1, 237 hangs on a thread. He is probably on track to finish a bit short of 1, 237. Our model puts his projected delegate deficit as slightly less than the number of delegates left unpledged (54) in Pennsylvania, meaning he would be projected to win if they were bound delegates. Although facing a challenge in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump has benefited from other quirks in the Republican primary rules. Compared with the Democrats’ rules, the Republican ones are far more favorable to a candidate who wins with a plurality of the vote. And with the race as close as it is, any number of tweaks in the rules could make Mr. Trump a clear favorite  —   or an overwhelming underdog.",0
21504,Election Heats Up: Kerry Heads To The Poles…In ANTARCTICA WTF,"We Are Change 

While many Americans headed to the polls to vote in the 2016 election on Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to… Antarctica.
Kerry’s trip will include a visit to the McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole stations, which will make him the first Secretary of State to visit Antarctica, according to a press release from the National Science Foundation.
It comes at a curious time, given the ongoing election. When asked about the timing, State Department spokesman John Kirby insisted that its purpose is “to talk to researchers and scientists largely about climate change research.” 
A reporter responded by questioning the legitimacy of the trip, noting, “There’s some criticism that this trip is basically, you know, the Secretary wants to knock Antarctica off his bucket list and he’s doing it on taxpayer expense.” 
Kirby insisted that it is important for Kerry “to see firsthand what we are learning about the environment down there on the South Pole.” 
“As an individual who has literally championed climate change research and awareness for decades now, the secretary is and will remain committed to increasing the awareness and education of the public about this,” Kirby said.

The location of Kerry’s trip is also interesting. Russian scientists drew criticism in 2012 for drilling into Antarctica’s “Alien” Lake Vostok, which scientists claim went “undisturbed by sunlight for over 15 million years.” 
Theories as to what is under the surface of the lake—which is considered the sixth largest in the world— include oil, a secret Nazi base with Hitler’s remains, nuclear energy, Atlantis, and of course, a UFO landing site.
Kerry’s trip will add to his lead as the Secretary of State who has traveled the most miles, with over 1.3 million since 2013. This sends him even further ahead former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who traveled 956,733 miles from 2009 to 2013.
In addition to staying away from the polls in the U.S. where he would be expected to vote for Clinton, Kerry is also showing her up by reminding the world that he beat her in total miles traveled—an area where Clinton was very competitive.
In 2010, Clinton wrote an email to her top aide Huma Abedin asking , “What’s my total now?” 
“We have 36 trips to date,” Abedin responded, noting that Clinton needed at least four more to beat the record of 1.06 million set by Condoleezza Rice.

21506,2006 Audio Captures Hillary Clinton Proposing To Rig Palestine Election,"  Carol Adl in Middle East , News , US // 0 Comments 
Hillary Clinton proposed rigging the Palestinian parliamentary elections while she was a US senator in 2006, according to a newly emerged recording. 
The decade-old audio exposes then-Senator Hillary Clinton saying the US should have manipulated Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 to prevent a Hamas victory. 
The US Democratic presidential nominee lamented that the US didn’t “determine who was going to win.” 
The result of that election was a victory for the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas over the US-favored Fatah political party. 
RT reports: 
“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,” then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election. 
“And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win,” she said. 
Until Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the newspaper’s office in Brooklyn. 
Chomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among top topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud. 
Speaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that “anyone could support the idea — offered by a national political leader, no less — that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.” 
The interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas. 
Then-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the “power of democracy,” but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israel’s existence and espoused violence. 
That day in September 2006, Clinton made “odd and controversial comments,” all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky “held onto all these years.” 
“I went to my bosses at the time,” Chomsky told the Observer. “The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody — even a direct quote from anyone — in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn’t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.” 
The latest revelation comes after repeated accusations by the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump who says that the media and the political establishment have rigged the 2016 election against him. 
It would seem that the crooked Mrs Clinton thinks nothing of rigging any election to suit her agenda.",0
21507,Poll: Majority of Americans Want Merit-Based Immigration,"A new survey shows widespread support for President Donald Trump’s plan to swap current U. S. immigration policy, based on   toward entry based on skills and merit. [In a Rasmussen Reports poll, 44 percent of likely American voters want to move to a   immigration system that only admits legal immigrants if their skills are needed in the U. S.  Only 37 percent of likely voters want to keep the current legal immigration system which is based solely on family chain migration. Another 18 percent of likely voters said they did not know which system they would prefer. Men, as well as younger likely voters, much prefer a   immigration system, with 51 percent saying they would like to see a switch, as opposed to 38 percent of women. Voters between the ages 18 to 30 favored a merit system by 49 percent. Voters from 40 to 64 preferred the status quo by 43 percent. While Trump’s   plan is wildly popular with 60 percent of Republicans, likely voters who do not identify with either of the two major political parties show 47 percent support as well. The poll also found that Americans continue to support deportations of illegal immigrants, even if the illegal immigrant has a child in the U. S.   percent of likely voters said illegal immigrants with children born in the U. S. should not be exempt from deportation. Only 37 percent disagreed. Across party lines, deportations of illegal immigrants with children remains popular, with 62 percent of Republicans supporting the action, along with 30 percent of Democrats and 46 percent of American voters who are not affiliated with either major political party.

21508,Shock: Colin Kaepernick Cares More About Protesting Than He Does About Football - Breitbart,"The sports media is just now learning what was apparent to conservatives and Republicans all last season: that Colin Kaepernick cares an awful lot more about politics than he does about football. [Peter King, from the Monday Morning Quarterback, spent the weekend of the NFL draft with the San Francisco 49ers. During that time, a time spent in close quarters with many of the 49ers staff, King came away with the distinct impression that many in the building felt Kaepernick would rather protest than play football.  King wrote, “I spent a long draft weekend with the Niners in California and there are those in the building who think Kaepernick might actually rather do social justice work   than play quarterback. ” King cites Kaepernick’s frequent tweeting about social justice and the Know Your Rights Camps, which the former 49er QB began somewhat recently. However, King also brought up Manhattan, where Kaepernick lives, and his wife Nessa, a DJ in New York City. King explains, “He emerges in New York City occasionally for noble cause work, last week donating 100 men’s suits to a parole office in Queens, so recipients, recently out of prison, would look more presentable when going on job interviews. I haven’t talked to Kaepernick, so I have no idea what his gut is telling him about what to do with his life. But it’s crazy that a quarterback who four years ago was coming off a Super Bowl appearance and looked to be a   answer has no team now and no hot NFL prospects that anyone can see. ” What’s crazier, is that Kaepernick’s true priorities and passions are apparently news to the sports media. Playing quarterback in the NFL has no equal in sports in terms of difficulty and complexity. It’s literally the hardest thing anyone could do in sports, requiring complete and total concentration and channeling of focus. Yet, after the media turned his protest into the biggest story in sports, certain to engulf him, his team, and obscure everything they would attempt to accomplish on the field, what did Kaepernick do? Did he stop, for the benefit of the team? No, he wore a Fidel Castro   to a press conference. How could anyone have seen this and come away with the conclusion that Kaepernick was putting football first? The sports media wanted so badly for Kaepernick to turn into a permanent statue of protest on television screens every Sunday throughout America, that they forgot all about the fact that you have to actually play really well in order to keep a job in the NFL. In fact, especially if you plan on insulting the flag and all who fought and died for it, you have to play exceedingly great. Kaepernick, obviously, did not play great, partially due to the fact that he’s never refined and evolved his game to counter defenses who have figured him out. But, in equal part, due to the fact that he was too busy buying pig socks. It’s still my opinion that Kaepernick will get signed at some point midseason. But, until then, the media will continue to have a sad about their protest puppet, and what might have been. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
21509,Poll: 21% of American Voters Approve of Republican Healthcare Plan,"A recent Quinnipiac poll reveals that only 21 percent of American voters support the Republican healthcare plan, a slight raise from 17 percent in March. [Overall, 56 percent of U. S. voters oppose the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Nearly   of white, Republican college graduates support President Donald Trump’s actions on health care.    percent of voters believe that health insurance costs will increase, 11 percent of voters believe that costs will decrease, and 37 percent of voters believe that health premiums will remain the same. Americans also approve,   percent, of the current Obamacare statute that prevents health insurers from raising health premiums for patients with   conditions. Congressman Tom MacArthur ( ) who was heavily involved in drafting the AHCA, told Breitbart News that the new healthcare law also protects Americans with   conditions. MacArthur explained: The other side has spent too much time speaking to people’s emotions and misstating the facts.   For example, with   conditions the bill could not be more explicit that insurers cannot discriminate, they can’t deny coverage, they can’t deny renewals, they can’t health rate someone who’s sick in the middle of being insured. If you get sick, your health rates don’t skyrocket. What it does say is that if you don’t maintain coverage for more than 63 days, you will pay an extra premium. However, states can request a waiver to look at those people, but they have to create a risk pool to ensure that the neediest amongst are not left behind. It balances to make sure people don’t skip out on buying health insurance when they get sick. That’s not fair to the rest of the American people. Voters believe,   percent, including   percent of Republicans, that it is a “bad idea” to give states the ability to waive certain Obamacare regulations that might reduce the cost of premiums. The question that begins, “Do you think that giving states the ability to decide whether or not to allow health insurance companies to raise insurance rates for Americans with   conditions?” however, might influence the voters’ answers.   percent of Americans believe that it is “very important” or “somewhat important” that all Americans can afford health care. The opposition to the American Health Care Act may surprise voters, although the sample for the poll favors Democrats and independents: Registered Voters Party Identification: The 11 percent gap between Republicans compared to either Democrats or independents might skew the polling data towards those who might want to retain, rather than reform, Obamacare. Tim Malloy, the poll’s assistant director, said in a press release, “Republicans gave up on their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare when a March 23 Quinnipiac University poll showed 17 percent of American voters supported their bill. ” “The second attempt wins the support of 21 percent of voters,” Malloy added. “The grim diagnosis from voters: Health care will cost more and deliver less. ” Read the poll results here.",0
21512,Suicide Bombing in Baghdad Kills at Least 36 - The New York Times,"BAGHDAD  —   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President François Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande, Haider   Iraq’s prime minister, said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborers’ shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim, 28, an owner of a nearby cellphone store, described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber’s vehicle, trying to get hired. “Then a big boom came, sending them up into the air,” said Mr. Hashim, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed “the most ineffective security forces in the world” for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital’s six million residents. “We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who’s supposed to protect us,” said Ali Abbas, a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. “If the securities forces can’t protect us, then allow us to do the job. ” Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately, the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a “  incident,” without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul, where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the   coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.",0
21513,"With Attention on Dakota, Obama Quietly Approves Two New Pipelines","161402 SHARES 
While the U.S. Department of Justice temporarily halted construction of a section of the Dakota Access Pipeline, two other pipelines are moving forward. 
In May, the Obama administration granted the permits for both the Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail pipelines, and while construction has not yet begun on the pipelines, implementation plans for the building of the pipelines is well underway. 
Earlier this week, DeSmogBlog investigative reporter Steve Horn highlighted the approval and pending construction of both pipelines, as well as their significant impact on local water supplies and indigenous territory. As Horn wrote, the Trans-Pecos pipeline will carry natural gas extracted from the Permian Basin in West Texas, and transport it across international borders to Mexico. 
According to the Texas Tribune, the 42-inch-wide Trans-Pecos Pipeline will carry 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas every day under the Rio Grande River. Should a leak or spill occur, the effects could be felt in both Texas and Mexico. The Comanche Trail pipeline, which is also 42-inches, will carry gas from the Waha Hub in the Northern part of Pecos County, Texas, to San Elizario, Texas, where it will then be carried across the United States/Mexico border . 
“[The] Trans-Pecos and Comanche go through the Big Bend area, a rural area containing mountains, desert, and ranch land. Most importantly, they link to a massive set of pipelines in Mexico that are in the process of being built and it’s a bit difficult to say what the impacts of land/spills would be there,” Horn told US Uncut. “What sorts of environmental/ecological reviews are being done in Mexico? What are the potential risks of spills there and would we even hear about them if they took place?” 
However, Horn says the “elephant in the room” on assessing environmental impact is the fracking being done to take natural gas out of Texas’ Permian Basin. 
“With temperature records being broken left and right, that’s what the conversation should really center around,” Horn said. 
According to the latest status report filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) earlier this month by pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners (the company also building the Dakota Access Pipeline), construction has not yet begun. However, because the pipeline has already been granted approval by both the United States and Mexican governments, Horn says the only recourse left for activists is civil disobedience. 
“Dakota Access, and everything that preceded the now-ongoing civil disobedience and largest convening of Native American tribes in modern history, shows the regulatory system is designed as a corporate rubber-stamp process,” Horn said. “The courts are happy to ratify rulings based on laws written by and for Corporate America.” 
Horn credited the Native American tribes chaining their bodies to pipeline construction equipment in North Dakota with the Obama administration’s recent call to temporarily halt Dakota Access Pipeline construction near the Missouri River. 
“[Civil disobedience] might be the only option left given how much the deck is stacked in favor powerful big business interests in the US regulatory and legislative system.”

21514,Trump Calls for Closer Relationship Between U.S. and Russia - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A day after the release of a damning intelligence report on Russia’s   efforts to influence the American election,   Donald J. Trump called on Saturday for a closer relationship between the two nations, saying only “stupid” people or “fools” would think this was unwise. The United States, Mr. Trump wrote in a series of Twitter messages Saturday morning, has “enough problems around the world without yet another one. ” He pledged that Russia would “respect us far more than they do now” after he is sworn in as president, and said that the two nations could perhaps work together on the international stage. For years, Russia has been anything but a willing partner of the United States. Relations became strained well before the   cyberattacks began nearly a year and a half ago, despite the Obama administration’s early effort to reset relations. After Russia’s intrusion into Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, the United States and its allies levied broad sanctions against the Russian economy and blacklisted dozens of its citizens, including some close to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. President Obama added to those measures last month in retaliation for the hacking, expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and imposing sanctions on two Russian intelligence services. Russia and the United States have also often been at odds over Moscow’s involvement in the war in Syria. Senior intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump on their findings on Russian election interference on Friday, before releasing a declassified report that concluded that Mr. Putin had “ordered” a sprawling campaign intended to denigrate Hillary Clinton and aid Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has consistently dismissed the intelligence agencies’ conclusions as politically motivated, but he appeared to soften that stance in a statement his transition team released after the briefing. He also seemingly conceded Russian involvement in the election, but he has taken pains to point out that there is no evidence that any vote tallies were altered, apparently seeking to avoid the suggestion that his victory was illegitimate. Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that it is time to “move on” from the focus on Russian meddling in the election, arguing that it has received such attention only because Democrats are embarrassed about their loss  —   an assertion he repeated on Twitter on Saturday. Late on Friday, he blamed the Democratic National Committee for the hacking of its computer systems, saying that “gross negligence” had allowed it to happen. Many Democrats said on Twitter that Mr. Trump was essentially engaging in  .",0

21518,"Vincent Viola, Billionaire Businessman, Is Trump’s Choice to Lead the Army - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump plans to nominate Vincent Viola, the billionaire founder of a   trading company, as secretary of the Army, the Trump transition office said. Mr. Viola, a retired Army major and graduate of West Point, is the owner of the National Hockey League’s Florida Panthers, former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange and founder of Virtu Financial. He is worth $1. 8 billion, according to Forbes, making him one of the 400 wealthiest Americans. He joins a growing list of billionaires selected by Mr. Trump for senior administration positions. In its statement announcing the selection, the transition office lauded Mr. Viola for working “tirelessly to promote the Army philanthropically in the areas of counterterrorism, cybersecurity and leadership development. ” Mr. Viola helped found the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point after the Sept. 11 attacks. The center describes itself as “an important national resource that rigorously studies the terrorist threat and provides   research while moving the boundaries of academic knowledge. ” Mr. Trump, in the announcement, described Mr. Viola as “incredibly accomplished and selfless. ” If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Viola, 61, would be the Army’s senior civilian leader, succeeding Eric Fanning, the   openly gay person at the Pentagon. Mr. Fanning has been helping to guide the country’s largest military service as it undertakes a sweeping integration of women into combat roles and lets openly gay soldiers serve. Mr. Viola would report to Gen. James N. Mattis, Mr. Trump’s choice for secretary of defense, if the Senate confirms General Mattis, a retired   officer in the Marines. A person familiar with Pentagon appointments for the transition said that General Mattis had reached an agreement with Vice   Mike Pence that the new defense secretary would choose who would fill the top policy jobs at the Pentagon  —   like under secretary of defense and general counsel  —   while the White House would select the service secretaries, like Mr. Viola. Mr. Viola, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Ranger School and served in the 101st Airborne Division. He holds a degree from New York Law School. In the statement from the Trump transition team, Mr. Viola called it an “honor” to be chosen and said, “A primary focus of my leadership will be ensuring that America’s soldiers have the ways and means to fight and win across the full spectrum of conflict. ” Mr. Trump has continued to meet with a series of   figures. On Saturday, after holding the final “thank you” rally of his transition, he met with Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire, for dinner at his    resort, a representative for the transition said on Monday. The meeting, reported by The Washington Post, was notable because Mr. Trump has vilified Mexico, and at times Mr. Slim, for illegal immigration and the loss of American manufacturing jobs. As a candidate, he also used Mr. Slim as a target in his frequent assaults on the news media, because Mr. Slim is a major shareholder in The New York Times Company.",0
21519,"‘The Only Good Cop is a Dead Cop,’ Says Alleged PA Cop-Killer","A manhunt for the killer of a Pennsylvania state trooper who responded to a domestic disturbance before being shot has ended after an overnight search. The suspected   is dead. [“The only good cop is a dead cop,” Jason Robinson, the    alleged   posted on Facebook earlier this month, according to the Central Daily Times in State College, Pennsylvania. The post was reported to have been deleted from Facebook about 1 a. m. on Saturday morning. The post was said to include an image of a police cruiser that crashed and a photo of an injured police officer.  Pennsylvania State Police officials confirmed that Robinson is dead following a massive overnight manhunt. The initial announcement did not state whether Robinson killed himself or if he was killed in an engagement with police, PennLive. com reported Saturday morning. UPDATE: “Troopers encountered Robison at an unoccupied mobile home not far from his residence,” State Police officials posted on Facebook. “Robison refused commands to surrender, made threats to harm additional law enforcement personnel, and was shot and killed in the ensuing confrontation. ” Trooper Landon Weaver was shot and killed after responding with another trooper to a call regarding a “  incident,” the Central Daily Times reported. The incident took place early Friday evening. Details of the encounter remain sketchy at this time. The shooting took place at a residence in Juniata Township, about an hour east of Pittsburg. Weaver had been dispatched to the suspect’s mother’s house to investigate a call about a violation of an order of protection that had been placed on Robinson, PennLive. com reported Friday evening. Before the alleged killing of Trooper Weaver, Robinson had several encounters with law enforcement. Court records reported by PennLive. com revealed he was currently awaiting trial on charges filed in December for theft, receiving stolen property, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and driving without a license. He was also arrested by state police troopers in April for unlawful   bodily injury, simple assault and harassment. A motion had previously been filed with the courts for a mental health evaluation. Trooper Weaver was in his first year as a state trooper. He became a state police officer in December 2015 but did not graduate from the police academy until June. Officials reported he is the 97th member of the Pennsylvania State Police to be killed in the line of duty. Weaver had been assigned to Troop G, Hollidaysburg, which is located near his home in East Freedom, Pennsylvania. He was also in his first year of marriage, having married his high school sweetheart, Macy Gottshall, in  June, the Central Daily Times reported. The trooper was the 140th law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP). He is the 63rd officer this year to have been killed by gunfire. The State of Pennsylvania has suffered the loss of three other law enforcement officers this year, the ODMP reported. Police Officer Scott Leslie Bashioum from the Canonsburg Borough Police Department was shot and killed just six weeks ago on November 10. Two correctional officers, Corrections Officer David M. Weaver and Correctional Officer Kristopher D. Moules, also died in the line of duty. Officer Weaver died in a fall and Officer Moules died from injuries in an assault.

21523,Putin “Collecting” Former US Allies,"How Putin’s Plan to Collect Former US Allies Could End the American Empire Oct 24, 2016 
( UR ) As Anti-Media reported Monday, analysis of recent events suggests President Vladimir Putin may have ulterior motives in sending the largest Russian naval fleet since the Cold War steaming toward the Mediterranean Sea. He may, in fact, be initiating the first stages of militarily securing the long-desired Turkish Stream pipeline. 
As highlighted , positioning the aircraft carrier-led fleet just off the western coast of Syria in the Mediterranean also strategically places it between friendly nations to the north and south — Turkey, with whom the pipeline deal was officially signed last week, and Egypt, with whom Russia is now expanding ties both militarily and economically. 
But in truth, the agreements being struck around the Mediterranean — while unquestionably important in their own right — are indicative of a much broader, and rather recent, Russian pattern. 
On the southeast border of Russian ally, Iran, for instance, lies Pakistan. Russia raised eyebrows back in September when it announced that for the first time in modern history Russia and Pakistan would conduct joint military drills — a signal Russia’s influence is spreading across Asia. 
In October, it was reported additional joint exercises between the two nations had been scheduled for 2017. 
Pakistan’s neighbor to the east is India. In mid-October, it was announced Russia’s largely state-owned oil company Rosneft, along with other partners, would invest around $12.9 billion in India’s Essar Oil. Additionally, a Russian state investment fund would work with an Indian counterpart to invest $1 billion toward Indian infrastructure. Share:",0

Rakesh Bemaani, the 16-year old son of billionaire Lokesh Bemaani, was caught in a mad chase yesterday, which resulted in his father being attacked by a vicious, bloodthirsty mob. The reason? The unsuspecting youngster was wearing one of the popular t-shirts that read “My dad is an ATM.” (Image via redbubble.net) 
A horrified Rakesh has vowed to never, ever don the t-shirt henceforth. “There I was, zooming around in my Merc as usual, with a few cops on the road saluting me. But as I was driving, I happened to notice large queues on the roads, outside ATMs. I thought of seeing what the problem was and stepped out of the car. The moment the crowd saw me, they looked intently at each other and before I knew it, they collectively sprinted towards me, gunning for my throat. I quickly hopped into my car and sped away, but they chased me unflinchingly. Thankfully, I saw my dad, surrounded by a few security guards, just returning from his morning walk. The guards were of no avail, as the mob overpowered them with ease and started frisking dad all over. Some of them even stuffed his mouth with their debit cards, hoping for some notes to come out. Thankfully, dad had only ₹500 and ₹1000 rupee notes in his wallet, so the mobsters threw the wallet right back at his face, spat at us and went back. It was only after the melee subsided, did I realize the reason for it all happening – I was wearing one of my dozen of ‘My dad is an ATM’ t-shirts. Phew! Never putting these on again,” the harrowed Rakesh narrated to The UnReal Times . 
Companies manufacturing the t-shirts have offered to insert a ‘NOT’ in the middle of the statement for free. “We’re recalling all such t-shirts and without any payment, we’re willing to stitch a ^ NOT after the ‘is’ and before the ‘an.’ The safety and security of our customers is our topmost concern,” one such clothing manufacturer stated. 
The Bemaani family, however, received a flurry of support from the Bollywood fraternity. Tweeting to PM Narendra Modi was actor Arshad Warsi, who stated, “Mr. PM, your so-called masterstroke and surgical strike is paining not only the poor and common men, but also the billionaires. Of what good is all this, really? Can you please come back to India and repeal this goddamn rule? I don’t mind sponsoring your return ticket, if you do this!” Warsi was followed by director Anurag Kashyap, who tweeted angrily to the PM demanding an apology. 
The Bemaani family was also visited by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who sat in protest against the abrupt demonetization scheme. “Like aloo ki factories, we also need paise ki factories instead of ATMs. If we empower the villagers, we can get this done soon,” the Nehru-Gandhi scion stated. The Delhi CM was far more scathing in his diatribe. “The psychopath isn’t happy with the already prevailing smog. He wants more people to come out to the streets, thereby increase the smog and punish Delhites fatally for not voting for him. Yehi to scam hai ji ,” the AAP chief yelled. 
A section of liberal democrats in the US, however, hailed the development as a sweet revenge against the presidential election of Donald Trump. “It’s all happening! Billionaires all over the world will have to incur people’s wrath like this, for having one of their own, and a racist, bigot, xenophobe at that, as the US president,” said one such tolerant, intellectual democrat.

21527,U.S. Accuses Chinese Jet of Flying Too Close to American Plane - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   The American military has accused a Chinese fighter jet of maneuvering too fast and too close to a United States Air Force   reconnaissance plane as it flew in international airspace over the East China Sea this week. The United States Pacific Command said in a statement that one of two Chinese jets involved in an intercept operation on Tuesday had “an unsafe excessive rate of closure on the   aircraft. ” “This seems to be a case of improper airmanship, as no other provocative or unsafe maneuvers occurred,” the Pacific Command said. The episode was the second report of an unsafe intercept recently by a Chinese jet tracking an American spy plane in the waters around China. Last month, the Pentagon said two Chinese fighter jets flew dangerously close to an   aircraft off the coast of Hainan, the southernmost province of China. In that case, the Chinese plane flew within 50 feet of the American plane over the South China Sea, breaking an agreement on safe conduct in the air that Beijing and Washington signed last year, the Pentagon said. The American plane had been on a routine patrol, the Pentagon said then. The East China Sea is a delicate area for China and Japan, an American treaty ally. Islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, a group of uninhabited rocks in the East China Sea, are at the center of a bitter territorial dispute between the two countries, which regularly send patrol ships close to them. China’s Ministry of Defense told Global Times, a   Chinese newspaper, that the United States was “deliberately hyping up the issue of reconnaissance by American military aircraft near China. ” Chinese military pilots always operate according to the rules and act in a “professional and responsible” manner, a ministry spokesman who was not identified by the newspaper was quoted as saying on Wednesday. The commander of the Pacific Command, Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. said at a conference in Singapore last weekend that he had seen “positive behavior” by Chinese military aircraft and ships recently. “Every now and then, you’ll see an incident in the air that we may judge to be unsafe,” Admiral Harris said. “Those are really, over the course of time, rare. ”",0
21528,Plane carrying Pence skids off runway at LaGuardia Airport,"A plane carrying Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence slid off the runway while landing at New York City’s Laguardia Airport Thursday evening. 
There was no immediate word of any injuries. 
The aircraft, a Boeing 737, tore up two tracks of concrete on the runway before coming to rest on a patch of grass. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement, “A crushable concrete runway safety technology called an Engineered Material Arresting System stopped the plane.” 
“We seemed to be sliding for the distance of the landing and a burning smell became very obvious — like rubber,” Fox News producer Dan Gallo wrote in an email. Hard to see much from these plane windows. But emergency vehicles are here. pic.twitter.com/XAkNSgDuWD

According to Gallo, Pence said that he saw mud on windows at the front of the plane when he came to check on passengers in the rear of the aircraft. 
“We can see mud on the front windows,” a calm Pence said in the press cabin about a minute after the plane came to rest. He said he felt fine. 
“So thankful everyone on our plane is safe,” Pence said in a later tweet . “Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow!” So thankful everyone on our plane is safe. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. Back on the trail tomorrow!

The roughly 40 passengers and crew on board, including Pence, were evacuated through the back of the aircraft as a large amount of emergency vehicles responded to the scene. 
Campaign spokesman Marc Loetter later told reporters that Pence had missed his fundraiser in New York City and was headed to his hotel for the night. Pence later called into his fundraiser being held at Trump Tower from the car in the motorcade as he drove into Manhattan. 
Campaign officials told Fox News another plane is on the way, and Pence looks forward to being on the campaign trail on Friday as planned. 
A Trump campaign spokesperson told Fox News in a statement the Republican nominee reached out to his running mate after the incident. 
“Mr. Trump did reach out to Gov Pence and is very glad everyone on board plane is safe,” Trump campaign spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said. 
Trump later told a crowd a campaign rally in Geneva, Ohio that “everbody is fine.” 
“I just spoke to our future Vice President and he’s okay,” Trump told supporters. “Do you know he was in a big accident wth the plane? The plane skidded off the runway and was pretty close to grave, grave danger, but I just spoke to Mike Pence and he’s fine, got out. Everybody’s fine.”

21531,"NCAA Shuns LGBTQ Groups, Restores NC as Destination for Championship Games - Breitbart","Much to the chagrin of LBGTQ groups, the National Collegiate Athletic Association removed its boycott of North Carolina as a venue for hosting championship games. [Until Tuesday the NCAA remained quiet about whether or not it would allow NC to regain permission to host the games.   The Tar Heel state lost its privilege as a destination for games in 2016 when it decreed under the law HB2 that all people, including transgenders, have to use bathrooms corresponding to their biological gender as indicated on their birth certificate. Many advocates for transgender rights believe the repeal of HB2, and replacing it with HB142, does not go far enough to protect the rights of transexuals. The new law essentially restores the status quo prior to HB2. However,    prohibits government entities from creating laws that pertain to   bathrooms, showers, and changing rooms unless it’s “in accordance with an act of the General Assembly. ” The new law only applies until December 1, 2020. According to The Washington Times, the NCAA called HB142 “far from perfect,” but “meets the minimal NCAA requirements,” therefore allowing them to lift the boycott of championship games. “We are actively determining site selections, and this new law has minimally achieved a situation where we believe NCAA championships may be conducted in a nondiscriminatory environment,” the NCAA said in a statement. “If we find that our expectations of a   environment are not met, we will not hesitate to take necessary action at any time. ”   advocacy groups were not happy with the NCAA’s decision. “What a ” Lambda Legal tweeted, after hearing the news. “The NCAA’s decision to backtrack on their vow to protect LGBTQ players, employees and fans is deeply disappointing and puts people at risk. ”  Chad Griffin, president of Human Rights Campaign responded, “After drawing a line in the sand and calling for repeal of HB2, the NCAA simply let North Carolina lawmakers off the hook. ” So far the NBA has not stated whether HB142 meets their minimum standards for holding   games in NC in the future. In February, the NBA relocated its   Weekend, which was scheduled for Charlotte, and moved it to New Orleans as a protest to HB2.",0
21537,We Finally Know Why Hillary Disappeared On Election Night: “She Was Crying Inconsolably… It Was Hard To Understand What She Was Saying She Was Crying So Hard”,"As Donald Trump’s election to the highest office of the land became inevitable on Tuesday night The Daily Sheeple reported that the Clinton campaign mysteriously went dark:
“THEY KNOW” – NBC Reports Clinton Campaign Has Gone Completely Dark – No Longer Talking To Media #trump #hillary #itsover #election 
— The Daily Sheeple (@TheDailySheeple) November 9, 2016 

Even Hillary herself must have know it was over, because she published a not-so-victorious Tweet to her supporters several hours before the official counts started being confirmed:
This team has so much to be proud of. Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything. pic.twitter.com/x13iWOzILL 
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 9, 2016 

As confirmation of Trump’s victory swept the world, many undoubtedly wondered what was going on in Hillary’s mind. Then, as reports of a Clinton concession came to the forefront, it turned out that Hillary, in an unprecedented move for a losing Presidential candidate, refused to take the stage in front of thousands of distraught party goers who were expecting a coronation and fireworks show.
Instead of Hillary, controversial campaign manager John Podesta took the stage to announce that the election wasn’t over and that votes were still being counted, implying that Hillary would not concede.
At that moment, we knew something was wrong:
Is something wrong with Hillary? Has she had another health episode? https://t.co/yP3fYWpinL #trump #hillary #vote #2016 #hillaryhealth 
— The Daily Sheeple (@TheDailySheeple) November 9, 2016 

Had Hillary suffered another health episode? Was she so emotionally destroyed by the loss that she couldn’t handle it mentally?
It turns out, according to Ed Klein who spoke with a close friend and confidante of Hillary, that she did, in fact, have a serious breakdown and was in no condition to speak to America on live television.
The shock of losing after having been a “98%” lock for the Presidency was simply too much to bare. And as you might expect from a Clinton, it was everybody else’s fault:
Here’s what I know, not my opinion. About 6:30 this morning she called an old friend. She was crying inconsolably. She couldn’t stop crying. And her friend, her female friend from way, way back said it was even hard to understand what she was saying she was crying so hard. This is Hillary we’re talking about.
Eventually her friend said she could make out that she was blaming James Comey, the Director of the FBI, for her loss, and, I don’t understand exactly, the president of the United States for not doing enough.

If all goes well, Hillary will be crying again when they put the handcuffs on her after President Trump’s special prosecutor recommends charges, that is, so long as Trump didn’t make a secret deal to let Hillary off the hook .

La cantante canaria Rosana Arbelo ha anunciado hoy la inminente publicación de su nuevo álbum, “Lunas de oferta”, un trabajo hecho en colaboración con Joseba de Carglass. 
“Carglass cambia, Carglass repara, Carglass sigue el camino del cortejo, a fuego lento, a fuego viejo”, reza la letra de “Lunas de oferta”, el single que da nombre al disco. 
La colaboración era un secreto a voces en el mundo de la música, pues es sobradamente conocido el interés de Rosana por las lunas. “Lunas rotas, luna nueva, ocho lunas… era cuestión de tiempo que ella y Joseba se conocieran”, explica el representante de la canaria. 
“Es el disco con la producción más barata que he hecho nunca”, reconoce Rosana, añadiendo que “las lunas de Carglass estaban a un precio irresistible y él sabe que a mí me da igual si están rotas. De hecho, tanto mejor”. 
“Lunas nuevas para lunas rotas” es el “single” elegido para presentar el álbum. “No te doy la luna llena porque es la eterna rosa”, canta Rosana en esta canción. Luego, añade Joseba: “Pero si tienes un impacto en tu parabrisas, puedes ahorrarte tiempo y dinero si lo reparas ya”.

21539,Kushner Family Is in Talks to Buy Miami Marlins - The New York Times,"The sale of a major league sports team always draws attention and local interest. But this one may attract even more interest, especially around the White House. The Kushners, the New York real estate family whose scion is a close adviser to President Trump, are in negotiations to buy the Miami Marlins baseball team, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The Kushners  —   led by Joshua Kushner, a venture capitalist, and Joseph Meyer, his    and key lieutenant for the family’s investments  —   have pursued the Marlins for several months, devising a complicated financial arrangement that would include bringing in partners later, these people said. Mr. Kushner is the younger brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s   . Neither Jared Kushner, who married Ivanka Trump in 2009 and is a top White House adviser, nor Charles Kushner, the family patriarch who spent over a year in prison for illegal campaign donations, tax evasion and witness tampering, is participating in the effort, these people said. Yet it was unclear whether a deal would be reached, or whether the family would prevail in any bidding contest. Forbes reported on Thursday that the team had a “handshake agreement” to sell the team for about $1. 6 billion, a figure that the people involved in the process said the Kushner family has contended was too high and refused to pay. Any deal would have to win the approval of Major League Baseball, which would closely scrutinize the buyer’s financing and would probably seek to ensure that Charles Kushner had no role in operations. The deal has already prompted questions within Major League Baseball, according to the people briefed on the conversations, about what kind of relationship Mr. Trump would have to the team and whether that would be a benefit or a disadvantage. Would fans or sponsors boycott or embrace the team or league based on a comment or Twitter post by Mr. Trump? And would Mr. Trump attend games? While Jared Kushner has not been not involved in the bidding for the Marlins  —   and he has pledged to be   from any of the family’s businesses  —   he and his brother had bid for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012, though they eventually withdrew from the bidding. The winner was a group backed by the financial firm Guggenheim Partners, which paid over $2 billion. As part of the financing for the Kushners’ bid, which was being shepherded by the boutique investment bank LionTree, the family would plan to bring in additional partners to help defray the costs. Representatives for the Kushners, the Marlins and LionTree declined to comment. Some of the people with knowledge of the Kushners’ bid said that Joshua Kushner, drawing upon his experience investing in technology companies like Instagram, saw potential profits in capitalizing on the Marlins’ digital rights. The Marlins are currently owned by Jeffrey Loria, who paid $158 million for the team in 2002 after selling the Montreal Expos back to Major League Baseball. The team won the World Series in 2003  —   when they defeated the Yankees  —   but has not returned to the playoffs since. Still, Mr. Loria persuaded   County to sell bonds to finance the construction of a new $639 million stadium. Critics of the agreement argued that the bond sale could eventually cost Miami taxpayers more than $1 billion. And there is one other potential wrinkle that might weigh on Mr. Loria: having to pay a percentage of any sale’s profits back to the county. As part of the Marlins’ agreement with the county, Mr. Loria would owe   money if he sold the team within 11 years of signing the 2009 stadium agreement. According to The Miami Herald, the payment would be based on the team’s 2009 valuation of about $250 million it has risen since then.",0

The police reportedly arrested at least 141 Native Americans and other demonstrators who are seeking to halt construction of a controversial oil pipeline. 
Press TV reports 
At least 141 protesters were arrested on Thursday evening and Friday morning as officers attempt to clear a camp on private property in the path of the proposed $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline, the Morton County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement. 
Officers in riot helmets used pepper spray and shot beanbag rounds on some of the estimated 330 protesters as helicopters flew overhead. 
Demonstrators also allegedly set a car and some tires on fire, giving the scene a war zone-like appearance. 
The protesters have been demonstrating for several months, and dozens have been arrested. Police expect additional protests, and possibly more arrests, in the coming days. 
Native American protesters had occupied the property that crosses the pipeline’s path since Monday in an effort to stop Energy Transfer Partners’ construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
The pipeline has infuriated the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and environmental activists who say it threatens the region’s water supply and sacred tribal sites. The tribe’s reservation is close to the pipeline’s route. 
North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said police were successful in clearing the camp. “Private property is not the place to carry out a peaceful protest,” he said. 
Demonstrators, however, say they aren’t trespassing on private property, citing an 1851 treaty with the US government that says the land belongs to Native American tribes. 
The Native American-led protest has grown into a larger movement in the United States, drawing in other tribes, environmentalists and advocates for Native Americans. 
The federal government has twice asked the pipeline operator to voluntarily pause construction near the tribe’s reservation while the authorities reconsider the project’s route. But courts have refused to compel a halt. 
The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe criticized law enforcement’s “militarized” response to the activists. “Militarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today. We continue to pray for peace,” Dave Archambault II said in a statement Thursday evening.",0

This is such bullshit.” Blackman went on to say that he wasn’t sure if he’d participate in another election since there really wasn’t an incentive for him to vote anymore.

21542,"Otto Warmbier, American Taken Hostage by North Korea, Dies Days After Return to U.S. - Breitbart","Otto Warmbier, an American student detained in North Korea for committing “hostile acts” has died, his parents confirmed Tuesday in a statement. He was 22. [Warmbier, who returned to America last Tuesday, having previously been sentenced to 15 years hard labor after stealing   paraphernalia from his hotel, had lapsed into a coma before his return. The North Korean government claimed Warmbier had contracted botulism shortly after his conviction of crimes against the communist state in March 2016.  Doctors treating Warmbier upon his return to Ohio stated, however, that they found no evidence of botulism, instead finding “extensive brain damage. ” The North Korean government has not remarked on the discrepancy or provided any explanation for what could have caused Warmbier such brain damage in prison. “It is our sad duty to report that our son, Otto Warmbier, has completed his journey home,” his family wrote in a statement. “We would like to thank the wonderful professionals at Cincinnati Medical Center who did everything they could for Otto. Unfortunately, the awful torturous treatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today. ” Otto Warmbier,    US student detained in North Korea, dies after returning home in coma pic. twitter.   —   Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 19, 2017,  According to the Warmbier family, Otto was “unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands. ” Warmbier had gone to North Korea in early 2016 on an adventure tour of the rogue state, under the auspices of the   Young Pioneer Tours, which preys on the curiosity of young westerners by offering “Budget tours to destinations your mother wants you to stay away from!” Warmbier was arrested during his visit for allegedly having attempted to steal a communist propaganda sign and forced to confess to the “serious crime” on North Korean television in February 2016. Warmbier pleaded guilty to taking down a political sign from a   area of his hotel. “I have made the worst mistake of my life, but please act to save me,” he said at the time. Under duress, Warmbier accused the United States of bribing him to steal the sign, calling it “the worst mistake of my life. ”  In an appearance carefully choreographed by North Korean authorities, Warmbier said that although his crime was “very severe and ” he was grateful for the regime’s “humanitarian treatment of severe criminals. ” Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for his “crime. ” North Korea continues to imprison three other U. S. citizens: academics Kim   and Tony Kim, and businessman Kim  . Update: President Donald Trump has released a statement on Warmbier’s passing: Melania and I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Otto Warmbier on his untimely passing. There is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life. Our thoughts and prayers are with Otto’s family and friends, and all who loved him. Otto’s fate deepens my Administration’s determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency. The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim.",0
21545,McClatchy: Breitbart’s Aaron Klein Leads Influential Israel Bureau,"On Monday, Katie Glueck, senior political correspondent for the McClatchy news agency, published an extensive profile of Breitbart Jerusalem and how bureau chief Aaron Klein leads a team that reports from the Middle East while Breitbart grows in influence during the era of President Donald Trump. [Gleuck reported:  On a Wednesday afternoon in March, Klein was found running Breitbart Jerusalem operations from his luxurious   apartment located, notably, not in Jerusalem but in Tel Aviv, the most liberal, cosmopolitan city in Israel. As storm clouds gathered over the Mediterranean, which was visible from his airy kitchen, Klein sipped a Diet Coke and alternated between expounding on the opportunities for Breitbart Jerusalem in the Trump era and tending to his dog, a black and white papillon named Uzi —  for the gun. “We have major influence right now politically,” said Klein, who also makes the   trek to Jerusalem multiple times a week to report. “Our platform skyrocketed since the election.

21546,Elon Musk Predicts Humans Will Soon Merge with Machines - Breitbart,"Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk explained to an audience at the World Government Summit in Dubai on Monday why humans will need to merge with machines to keep up in an   world. [“Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence,” declared Musk. “It’s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output. ”  “Some high bandwidth interface to the brain will be something that helps achieve a symbiosis between human and machine intelligence and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem,” he continued. “Musk explained what he meant by saying that computers can communicate at ‘a trillion bits per second’ while humans, whose main communication method is typing with their fingers via a mobile device, can do about 10 bits per second,” reported CNBC. “In an age when AI threatens to become widespread, humans would be useless, so there’s a need to merge with machines, according to Musk. ” In November, Musk predicted that automated robots would lead to mass unemployment, which could eventually create a universal wage from the government. In June, the billionaire tech entrepreneur claimed it likely that mankind is living in a   computer simulation. Musk was also one of the Silicon Valley billionaires, along with fellow PayPal Mafia members Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, who invested $1 billion into an artificial intelligence center in 2015.

[Black Lives Matter organizers are planning a protest dubbed “Stand Up, Fight Back: Super Bowl LI Protest March. ”  “It is time for the city government of Houston to see how diverse we are,” organizers posted on Facebook. “The grand claim was made that we are a ‘welcoming city,’ but the treatment of the local homeless community, gentrification, lack clarity on where our elected leaders stand on Trump’s policies and of course the issue of anti Blackness need to be addressed. ” “WE WILL MARCH UP FANNIN FROM HERMANN PARK TO NRG PARK. RAIN OR SHINE,” organizers wrote. The march is scheduled to coincide with the arrival of attendees to the Super Bowl. Attendees have been encouraged to use public transportation. Some of the seating capacity of these buses and trains could be taken up by protesters in an attempt to slow down the attendees’ arrival to the NRG Stadium. The protest is expected to end before game time. A massive security operation is underway in advance of Sunday’s Super Bowl LI presentation. Additional resources have been brought in from local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. U. S.

Coulter said, “I love the tweets. Almost everything that everyone else dislikes about Trump are what I consider his strong points. I love his tweets. That is how he defends himself. I love that he had steak —  he brought his own steak to Saudi Arabia —  everything others attack him for. What I’m concerned with —  I’m not —  I mean, we had no choice. What were you going to do, vote for Rubio? No. Both political parties for years and years have been pushing whatever Wall Street and elites want. Trump was the only candidate who is going to put Americans first. I just want him to get back to his campaign promises, but I love his 3 a. m. tweets. I think they’re hilarious. ” “I hope Trump notices that if he doesn’t keep his promises, Republicans will be wiped out in the midterm election,” Coulter warned. “Democrats will have the House of Representatives, and they will absolutely impeach him. It doesn’t matter. He could be purer than Caesar’s wife. They will impeach him. The   base is obsessed with that. So Trump better keep his promises. ” She added, “I blame the Republicans in Congress the most, but we always knew that. I know they were traitors again, working for the lobbyists, the Chamber of Commerce and Wall Street, and not for the American people. We knew that Trump would have a tough road to hoe, but he was supposed to go down and be a bull in a china shop. We’re still waiting for the bull in the china shop. I mean, there is obviously still time. It has only been a few months now, but so far, that budget deal, it was, it was like a George Soros practical joke. I mean, sending Washington bureaucracy $18 million to study misogyny in the Marines, funding for a wall specifically prohibited, funding for, you know, Planned Parenthood. No, this isn’t what we voted for, And I do think Trump meant what he said. You wouldn’t go through what he went through for 18 months, being attacked by both political parties, the entire media, the Washington bureaucracy, it is tough when he is up against. It’s what he promised. That is what we want. ” (  Grabien) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

21553,President Higgins Accidentally Visits Laois Instead Of Laos After ‘GPS Fuck Up’,"0 Add Comment 
AN EMBARRASSING sequence of events has led to Irish President Michael D. Higgins taking an elaborate detour from his official tour of South East Asia and ending up in a field in Laois, WWN can exclusively report. 
After an historic visit to Vietnam, President Higgins was expected to then head to the neighbouring nation of Laos, but a GPS entry mishap on board Ireland’s presidential jet sent the travelling party several thousand miles in the wrong direction. 
Disembarking from the plane and unaware of his true location, the President was heard remarking “I know it isn’t a well off country but fuckin’ hell this kip looks like Laois”. The President then greeted a bewildered Portlaoise farmer, whose field the plane had landed in, by speaking fluent Thai. 
The President was said to livid after discovering that someone had erroneously typed ‘Laois’ into the plane’s on-board GPS. 
“One fuckin’ holiday I wanted this year, just one fuckin’ holiday and some eejit pilot has bollocks’d it,” the normally articulate leader shouted.

21555,Soldiers Getting Stiffed,"Butler Shaffer  blog/soldiers-getting-stiffed/ 
There is a long-standing myth that “soldiers fight for our freedom.” The fraudulent nature of this claim is found, repeatedly, in examples that confirm that soldiers do not even fight for their own freedom, much less that of the rest of us. One finds current evidence for this in the California National Guard having offered reenlistment bonuses up to $15,000 to each of some ten thousand soldiers then serving in the Iraq/Afghanistan war. The soldiers and California Guard contractually agreed to this, but the federal government, some ten years later, is now intervening to demand that the soldiers return such bonuses, on the grounds that the California National Guard did not have the authority to enter into such contracts. Many of the ex-soldiers are now being threatened with foreclosure on the liens the government had put on their homes, lawsuits, or with garnishment of wages, and other remedies sought by the federal government. 
Who are these soldiers to complain? Don’t they know that respect for the inviolability of contracts applies only to “persons” (i.e., to human beings) and that they, along with the rest of us, have been redefined as government “assets,” not self-owning persons? When Tony Snow – then White House press secretary under President George W. Bush – dismissed the deaths of some 2,500 American soldiers as “it’s a number,” and when earlier Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared that the boycott-incurred deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children was acceptable to her, the state was telling us of our status as no more than resources for its ends. 
Readers familiar with Jacques Ellul’s critiques of the “technological imperative,” will see how this dehumanizing premise gets played out, not only on battlefields, but even in more peaceful settings. At a time when the institutional order boasts of the computerized, driverless trucks and cars it is now introducing to American highways, we witness yet another step in the process of helping us turn ourselves into mindless robots, programmed by our Frankenstein masters. Robots have no independent will or sense of being to be respected by arrogant established authorities. Like the aforementioned soldiers, the relationship between ourselves and the corporate-state is no more to be thought of as contractually-based than is our relationship to a family dog or cat 1:09 pm on October 26, 2016",0

21559,Check your Ballets Voting Machines Malfunction,"Keywords: Election 2016 , rigged election , Voting , voting errors , voting machines malfunction Voting Machines Malfunction 
This is just a straight up fact, especially since many of our voting machines are so antiquated. As you vote this year you should watch out for these glitches. Sometimes the votes appear to be “flipped” as in a voter intends to vote for Candidate A, but Candidate B’s name is selected on the screen. 
When this happens it is known as “vote flipping,” and is supposed to only happen rarely. With millions of votes cast, there have supposedly only been a few hundred reports of vote flipping every year for the past decade. These are the ones reported so you do wonder whether this happens unnoticed much more often. I’m just saying I’m seeing reports of this specifically happening all around the country so cast your vote and double check. Check your ballot after you cast your vote and if it happens to you call on a poll worker to help get it fixed. Remember Voting Machine malfunctions do happen. 
There are reports of this happening already in North Carolina, Texas and Nevada with machines vote flipping in the last couple weeks. 
“You have to remember that the majority of the machines in use today predate the iPhone or the iPad, and most of them use technology from the late ’90s,” Lawrence Norden, a voting technology expert at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, told TIME. “As these machines age, you start to have hardware issues.” 
One problem that also occurs on older machines is the glue that attaches the screen to the machine breaks down and you can get alignment issues as well. Poll workers and technicians need to reset the machines regularly to ensure the buttons are lined up right. In other cases, it can just be a user error because no one uses the type of equipment used at the voting centers on a regular basis. 
In Texas voters reported attempting to vote a straight Republican ticket, but found the Clinton/Kaine ticket selected instead. This can be found specifically in voting districts where they use the old, rotary-style voting machine. 
If you select one candidate and the other appears on the screen or if you’re looking at the summary screen and it just isn’t right voters should notify the poll workers. They can cancel out your session so you can do it over. Poll from PressTV.com 10/28/2016",0

Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the Trump administration weighed the fact that concerns about Mike Flynn were coming from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, “who is not exactly a supporter of the president’s agenda. ”  Spicer said, “One thing that’s important to note is —  let’s look at again how this came down. Someone who is not exactly a supporter of the president’s agenda, who a couple days after this first conversation took place refused to uphold a lawful order of the president, who is not exactly someone that was excited about President Trump taking office or his agenda. ” “She had come here, given a   told us there were materials and at the same time, we did what we should do,” he continued. “Just because someone comes in and gives you a   about something and says I want to share some information doesn’t mean you immediately jump the gun and go take an action. I think if you flip the scenario and say what if we had just dismissed somebody because a political opponent of the president had made an utterance, you would argue it was pretty irrational to act in that manner. We did what we were supposed to do. The president made ultimately the right decision. ” Spicer added Yates was “appointed by the Obama Administration” and “a strong supporter of Clinton. ”",0

21565,"News: Inspiring: This Woman Wasn’t Born Before Women Could Vote, But She’s Still Pretty Fucking Old","Email 
In an election season full of anger and divisiveness, it’s easy to lose sight of just how important and meaningful our democratic process is. Thankfully, as millions have cast their ballots today, there’s been no shortage of heartwarming stories involving Americans exercising their right to vote. One of those stories centers around lifelong Mississippi resident Helen Karnes, who, although not quite old enough to have been born before women won the right to vote, is still pretty goddam old. 
Wow. What a special woman! 
While Karnes can’t claim that she was alive during a time when women were still politically disenfranchised, it just takes one look at her to tell that she’s fucking old. No, she might not have the inspiring, thematically satisfying story of a 100-year-old, but you get the sense that she’s definitely lived through some shit. She was certainly around in WWII times, and she might’ve even been there for the Depression, too. Who knows? This is no spring chicken we’re talking about here. 
Though, admittedly, Karnes’ story would be a bit cooler if she’d been alive before 1920, you still have to applaud her for being old on this historic Election Day. Also, her mom and her aunts were definitely alive before women’s suffrage, so you know she’s probably got some good secondhand stories that she heard from them. Maybe one of them was even an important figure in the women’s rights movement or something. Statistically speaking, that’s probably not the case, but you never know! 
It’s unclear if Karnes voted today for America’s first female presidential nominee, or if she even voted at all. But what matters is that she’s brittle, stooped-over, and ancient. There are probably lots of dusty ol‘ bats out there who are older than Karnes and who have more of a substantial foothold in U.S. women’s history, but this lady is still more or less a living skeleton. And that’s something that should make us all proud to be Americans.",0
21567,NATO Imposes Sanctions On Itself After Killing 30 Afghan Civilians,"0 Add Comment 
IN an attempt to avoid accusations of hypocrisy NATO has taken swift action on itself after the death of 30 civilians in Afghanistan were killed by a NATO airstrike. 
Women, children and babies were among the innocent civilians struck by a missile in the Kunduz region of the country, prompting NATO to adopt the sort of stern rhetoric it normally adopts for when non-NATO nations carry out premeditated attacks on civilian populations. 
“Bold NATO, bold!” the organisation said, chastising itself, with further scolding not ruled out if similar tragedies were to occur again. 
Airstrikes were called in when US and Afghan forces came under fire from Taliban forces occupying a village in the northern province. 
Asked if a lengthy investigation would take place and possibly result in punishment for those involved in making the decisions which led to the fatalities, NATO was vague. 
“No, we’re the good guys,” it confirmed. 
The sanctions imposed include NATO restricting itself from being livid with on the ground independent monitors of conflicts for accurately reporting events and getting information to the public, for at least one week. 
The tragic loss of life in Kunduz comes one year after 42 innocent people were mistakenly killed in a US airstrike on a hospital operated by Médecins Sans Frontiéres in Kunduz, and 7 years after a US airstrike killed over 90 civilians in error in Kunduz.",0

[“Meryl Streep, one of the most   actresses in Hollywood, doesn’t know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes,” Trump writes on Twitter. “She is a Hillary flunky who lost big. ”  Streep accused of Trump making fun of a disabled reporter, lamenting that the event “sank its hooks in my heart. ” “It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie it was real life,” she said. But Trump argued that he was simply showing the reporter “groveling” for changing a 16 year old story to make him look bad. “Just more very dishonest media!” he concluded. Streep vocally supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign, and boldly celebrated that she would be the first woman president in a DNC convention speech.  “You’re gonna make history again in November. Because Hillary Clinton will be our first woman president. And she will be a great president,” Streep said at the time. “And she will be the first in a long line of women. And men. Who serve with grit and grace. ” In June 2016, Streep also did an unflattering Trump impression during a performance at the Public Theater Gala, as she smeared a spray tan on her face and sang for the audience.  She also gave a tribute speech to Hillary Clinton during a 2012 Women in the World summit.  In December 1, 2012, Streep snapped selfies with Hillary Clinton as she prepared another run for president. During her Golden Globes speech, she fretted that Trump would make the country worse. “Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence.

21574,Tumult in Turkey: The Key Players - The New York Times,"A faction of military forces in Turkey attempted a coup on Friday night, but within a few hours it appeared to be faltering. Here is a list of the key players involved in, or held responsible for, the night’s events. • The Turkish Armed Forces Turkey’s military is a trusted institution, seen as the guardian of the secularist principles on which modern Turkey was founded. It has intervened in national politics a number of times, including three previous coups since 1960, and, as recently as 1997, it maneuvered to oust an Islamist prime minister. Historically, the military has opposed interventions abroad, but it is not known how its senior officers, many of them appointed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, feel about his recent interventions in Syria. • President Erdogan An Islamist and populist who has been the dominant figure in the country for more than a decade, Mr. Erdogan came to power promising to reform the economy and give the country’s rural, more religious majority a bigger voice in the capital. More recently, he has grown increasingly autocratic and alienated many Turks as he cracked down on protests, took control of the media and renewed a war with Kurdish militants in the country’s southeast. • Fethullah Gulen Mr. Gulen is a former imam and onetime ally of Mr. Erdogan who now lives in   exile in the United States, and has an extensive following in Turkey. He has promoted a more liberal stream of Islam, and his ideas are popular with the country’s police and intelligence establishments, though not necessarily the military. Mr. Erdogan accused Mr. Gulen and his supporters, whom Mr. Erdogan has called terrorists, of being responsible for the coup he has repeatedly accused Mr. Gulen of plotting against him in the past. The Gulen movement has denied any involvement in the coup attempt and denounced any military intervention in Turkey’s domestic affairs. • Republican People’s Party  The leftist main opposition party is considered less   than the governing Justice and Development Party. It has been trying to find a way to break Mr. Erdogan’s political grip, but it would not be likely to benefit from a coup in the past, the military has tended to sideline leaders of all political parties when it took power. In a statement, party leaders spoke out against the coup. • NATO and the United States Turkey has been an American ally and a NATO member since 1952. Though the Obama administration has criticized Mr. Erdogan’s crackdown on civil society in Turkey, the United States sees him as a stabilizing and mainly   leader in a volatile region. The   coalition fighting the Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq makes heavy use of Incirlik Air Base in Turkey.",0

Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank: “Following a host of negative news, which culminated with another erratic U.S. inventory report, oil has stabilized and moved higher, driven by short-covering and the sense that it may have become too pessimistic about an OPEC deal being reached.” London broker PVM: ""There is a massive market-share battle going on between Russia and Middle Eastern oil producers that sees Saudi oil ending up in Poland and Russian crude in traditional OPEC markets in the Far East.” ""Last but definitely not least ... Russia is in dire economic difficulty and needs cash.""

21580,"Cyrus Mistry speaks out, says TATA removal didn’t hurt as much as punny headlines on it","Cyrus Mistry speaks out, says TATA removal didn’t hurt as much as punny headlines on it Posted on Tweet 
Ousted TATA group chairman Cyrus Mistry finally spoke out regarding the development, terming that while getting the boot did hurt , it was nowhere in comparison to what he felt after reading dozens of pun-filled headlines over his name and ouster. 
“What the hell, yaar ? Whatever I pick up, all I read is: Mystery over Mistry’s ouster; Che-Mistry no more, TATA group sacks chairman; Mist yet to clear on why Mistry was ousted, TATA says tata to Mistry. I can’t take this anymore! Please stop. I can always find another job or even become a chairman of some other company if lady luck favors me, but will these Mistry puns ever end? I’ve had enough of this pun-ishment!” the ex-chairman cried out to The UnReal Times . The businessman was soon supported by Sixth Sense scientist Pranav Mistry, who tweeted, “I feel you, bro!” 
The mainstream media, however, shot back at Mistry, asking him to take a chill pill. “Sigh-rus Mistry clearly not happy over some witty puns, eh? ;)” tweeted Times Group chairman Vineet Jain. Jain’s tweet was soon followed by rival newspaper The Hindu publisher, N Ram’s tweet: “About time Cyrus gulps in some Citrus juice to calm himself. Ratan Tata’s right about the intolerance part – it’s coming from his own ex-chairman!” 
An upset Mistry mentioned that sooner or later, he would have to change his name if things continue this way. “The last thing I want now is Cyrus Broacha meeting me and the media saying ‘Cyrus broaches Mistry!’ AAARGH!” an angry Mistry cried. He was, however, consoled by actor Neil Nitin Mukesh. “Be happy you have a popular 2-word name and not a 3-word one. That’s much, much, much better! Seriously, seriously, seriously!” Neil Nitin Mukesh reportedly told him. 
Media-appointed BJP MP, the VHP’s Sadhvi Prachi, who usually asks people to go to Pakistan, got into a bit of a lighthearted mood herself. “If Cyrus doesn’t like what happened, he can go to Cyprus!” the Sadhvi exclaimed. The ex-chairman was also approached by Sports Minister Vijay Goel, who told him, “I can never get a selfie with Miley Cyrus. So let me at least get one with Mistry Cyrus.” 
Mistry’s biggest consolation and shoulder to cry on, though, came all the way from South Africa, from the quarters of wicket keeper Quinton De Kock. “I can’t tell you how it feels each time I trend on Twitter and see the tweets about me. Trust me, you’re much better off. You just can’t imagine how cocky some tweeters can get. Oops!” the keeper is supposed to have said. Tweet About Ashwin Kumar

[The Chicago Tribune puts the precise number at 403. Moreover, the Tribune shows that there were more shooting victims in January 2017 than in January 2016, which means last’s year carnage not only carried over into this year but increased.  Breitbart News reported more than 300 people were shot in the first 30 days of 2017 alone. The Tribune reported 302 shootings January 1 through January 30, which is an average of just over 10 a day for 30 days. There have already been 70 homicides in Chicago   . There were 54 in the first 30 days of 2017 alone. By January 22 of this year, it was clear Chicago was on a trajectory for another year of bloody streets and lost lives. According to the Tribune, “At least 228 people were shot in Chicago [January 1 through January 22, 2017],” which was an increase of 16 victims above the number shot during the same period in 2016. And there were “at least 42 homicides” by January 22, marking a “23. 5 percent   …     [increase from] the 34 homicides from the same period in 2016. ” On January 24 President Trump tweeted: If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible ”carnage” going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016) I will send in the Feds!  —   Donald J.

21592,Al Franken Disinvites Kathy Griffin from Book Event,"Sen. Al Franken ( ) has disinvited Kathy Griffin from an upcoming book event one day after saying he would still appear with her in the wake of the controversy generated by a photograph in which the comedian posed with what looked like President Donald Trump’s decapitated head. [Griffin had been set to appear alongside Franken at an event at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on July 7 to discuss Franken’s new book, Giant of the Senate.  In a Wednesday appearance on CNN, the senator said the image of Griffin holding a bloody, fake head meant to resemble that of the president was a “horrible mistake” and “had no business being in our public discourse. ” But Franken  —   who has previously received campaign donations from Griffin  —   said the July book event would continue as scheduled. Franken backtracked Thursday, saying “it would be best” for Griffin not to appear at the event. “After hearing from many Minnesotans who were rightfully offended, I’ve come to the conclusion that it would be best for her not to participate in the event we had previously scheduled. I understand why Minnesotans were upset by this, and I take that very seriously,” Franken told Politico Thursday. “I believe what Kathy Griffin did was inappropriate and not something that should be anywhere in our national discourse. I consider her a friend and I’m glad she realized she crossed the line and apologized,” he added. The photo of Griffin  —   taken by L. A.  photographer Tyler Shields  —   sparked a firestorm when it was first published by TMZ Tuesday morning. CNN fired the comedian from her role as   of its New Year’s Eve coverage, and at least five venues have cancelled scheduled performances on her comedy tour. Griffin is set to hold a press conference Friday morning to address the “true motivation” behind the image, and respond to the “bullying” she says she had endured by the Trump family.

21599,Latest poll shows Trump with 4-point lead in Florida,"Print 
Donald J. Trump has slowly but surely improved his standing in state and national polls since the final presidential debate. 
A New York Times Upshot/Siena poll released Sunday is consistent with that trend: It gives Mr. Trump a four-point lead in Florida, 46 percent to 42 percent, in a four-way race. In our first poll of Florida a month ago, Mr. Trump trailed Hillary Clinton by a percentage point. 
The survey is Mr. Trump’s best recent poll in Florida, and it should be interpreted with caution. In general, it is best to look at an average of polls. Mrs. Clinton still leads in an average of recent Florida surveys by nearly three points. 
But the poll is not the only one to show Mr. Trump in the lead. A Bloomberg/Selzer poll , which is methodologically similar to the New York Times Upshot/Siena poll, showed Mr. Trump with a two-point edge last week.",0
21601,Matthew McConaughey to Hollywood: ’Embrace’ Donald Trump,"  actor Matthew McConaughey sent a sobering message to celebrities and the cultural elites protesting Donald Trump’s election and his new administration: get over it. [During an interview with ChannelFi to promote his new film, Gold, McConaughey was asked if he thinks Hollywood had given Trump a chance to govern.  “Well, they don’t have a choice now. He’s our president,” the Oscar winner said. “And, it’s very dynamic and as divisive of an Inauguration and time as we’ve had. At the same time, it’s time for us to embrace and shake hands with this fact. And be constructive with him over the next four years. ” Even if you have strong disagreements with Trump, McConaughey says, it’s worth waiting to see what he actually does in his first term in office. “So anyone, even those who may strongly disagree with his principles or things he’s said and done  —   and that’s another thing, we’ll see what he does compares to what he has said  —   no matter how much you even disagreed along the way, it’s time to think about how constructive can you be,” he said.  Some of the entertainment industry’s biggest stars have spent months protesting Trump’s stunning Election Night victory over Hillary Clinton, and have caused outrage over his Cabinet appointments, his executive orders, and even his pick for the Supreme Court. Celebrities have even gone so far as to launch personal attacks against Trump’s    son. But McConaughey says it’s past time Trump’s detractors stop protesting Trump for the sake of protesting. “‘Cause he’s our president for the next four years, at least,” McConaughey said, “the President of the United States. ” McConaughey’s new thriller Gold, in which he plays a prospector in Indonesia, opened in theaters on Jan. 27 and is directed by Stephen Gaghan.

21602,Arsenic and Lead: Read This Before Eating Rice,"Rice is a staple food in many cultures, but are certain types of rice dangerous to human health? 

While fears about lead in rice are based in research, researchers who originally presented the study that found high levels of heavy metal in imported rice are realizing that their results may have been skewed by faulty equipment. 

Tsanangurayi Tongesayi, a PHD of Monmouth University in New Jersey, first presented his alarming findings at the American Chemical Society’s annual meeting in March 2013. He conducted tests on rice imported from Taiwan, China, the Czech Republic, Bhutan, Italy, India, and Thailand, and revealed that the grains of rice could be contaminated with 6 to 12 parts per million lead. That is nearly 10 times the amount of lead that is considered safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 

Yet, when he replicated those findings in order to get the study published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Health, the levels were less than 1 part per million which was less lower than his previous findings. 

Tongesai had also sent the original testing equipment back to the manufacturer and the company had reported that it had been miscalibrated. 

The authors of the study are still trying to understand the lead content in rice and are using other methods to analyze the amount of lead these grains contain. 

Though the amount of lead in rice is still questionable, detectable levels of the carcinogen arsenic has been found in every one of the 60 rice products tested. 

Why would arsenic be found in rice? Arsenic can naturally occur in water, soil, and rocks, but its levels may be higher in some areas than others. It can readily enter the food chain and may accumulate in significant amounts in both animals. When eaten, this can have an effect on human health. 

Arsenic is the primary reason to limit your consumption of rice because it is extremely detrimental to human health. 

If you still love rice and want to be healthy in your consumption… 

Transition into eating wild rice which has much lower levels of arsenic than regular rice. 

Eat rice grown in California because arsenic levels are higher in rice that is grown in areas like Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas and much lower in rice that is grown in the west. 

Substitute rice for grains like quinoa, buckwheat, millet, and amaranth.

21607,"Media Matters brags taking Lou Dobbs off CNN, Glenn Beck off FOX: Project Veritas","
Project Veritas Action has released the sixth video in a multi-part series that is sending shockwaves through the DNC and the Clinton campaign. In a new video released by Project Veritas Action, a PVA journalist exposes how his pay for play with Robert Creamer landed him a meeting with Bradley Beychock, the President of Media Matters For America, an organization that has been attacking James O’Keefe for years.
Bradley Beychock is first seen in the undercover video bragging how he is responsible for taking knowable conservative voices off TV stations with pressure campaigns: “Lou Dobbs from CNN left now and he is on FOX Business, Glenn Beck off of FOX News.” So it seems that there is simply no tolerance and no room left for conservatism in the media, yet they claim the system isn’t rigged? Of course its rigged!
During the meeting, Beychock gave the PVA journalist a tour of their offices. He also proudly boasted about the Media Matters assault on conservative writer and political consultant Roger Stone.
“So I think for Trump, our big role as a media watchdog has been to take his MVPs and put them on the sidelines. So the first one was Roger Stone,” said Beychock.
James O’Keefe interviewed Stone and showed him the footage, to which Stone responded.
Shortly after James O’Keefe and Roger Stone were interviewed together on Alex Jones’s show, Media Matters put up the Alex Jones interview on their website.
Media Matters is funded by Clinton confidante George Soros.
Project Veritas Action Fund (AKA Project Veritas Action) was founded by James O’Keefe to investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct.

21611,7 Foods That Will Naturally Cleanse Your Liver,"by Jonathan Benson 
The primary way in which your body expels toxins is via the liver, which detoxifies and cleanses your body by continuously filtering the blood of poisons that enter it through the digestive tract, the skin, and the respiratory system. But when your liver becomes overworked as a result of stress or excessive exposure to toxins, your entire system can be thrown off balance, and your health severely compromised. 
Since the liver is also responsible for producing bile, another form of detoxification that is metabolically necessary for the breakdown and assimilation of fats and proteins from your food, it is exceedingly important that your liver be properly maintained. Without a well-functioning liver, your body will be unable to cleanse itself and absorb nutrients, which is a recipe for a health disaster. 
“The thousands of enzyme systems that are responsible for virtually every body activity are constructed in the liver,” writes Dr. Karl Maret, M.D., about the importance of vibrant liver function. “The proper functioning of the eyes, the heart, the brain, the gonads, the joints, and the kidneys, are all dependent on good liver activity.” 
“If the liver is impaired from constructing even one of the thousands of enzyme systems the body requires, there is an impairment in overall body function and a resultant greater metabolic stress on the individual.” 
So here are seven important foods you may want to begin incorporating into your diet in order to maintain a healthy liver. 

Garlic, grapefruit, green tea, and green vegetables Garlic contains numerous sulfur-containing compounds that activate the liver enzymes responsible for flushing out toxins from the body. This bulbous relative of the onion also contains allicin and selenium, two powerful nutrients proven to help protect the liver from toxic damage, and aid it in the detoxification process. 
Grapefruit is rich in natural vitamin C and antioxidants, two powerful liver cleansers. Like garlic, grapefruit contains compounds that boost the production of liver detoxification enzymes. It also contains a flavonoid compound known as naringenin that causes the liver to burn fat rather than store it ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk ). 
Green tea is loaded with catechins, a type of plant antioxidant that has been shown in studies to eliminate liver fat accumulation and promote proper liver function ( http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v26/n11/abs/0802141a.html ). This powerful herbal beverage also protects the liver against toxins that would otherwise accumulate and cause serious damage. 
Leafy green vegetables such as bitter gourd, arugula, dandelion greens, spinach, mustard greens, and chicory also contain numerous cleansing compounds that neutralize heavy metals, which can bear heavily on the liver. Leafy greens also eliminate pesticides and herbicides from the body, and spur the creation and flow of cleansing bile. 

Avocados, walnuts, and turmeric Rich in glutathione-producing compounds, avocados actively promote liver health by protecting it against toxic overload, and boosting its cleansing power ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/12/001219074822.htm ). Some research has shown that eating one or two avocados a week for as little as 30 days can repair a damaged liver. 
Walnuts, which contain high levels of l-arginine, an amino acid, glutathione, and omega-3 fatty acids, also help detoxify the liver of disease-causing ammonia. Walnuts also help oxygenate the blood, and extracts from their hulls are often used in liver-cleansing formulas. 
Turmeric, one of the most powerful foods for maintaining a healthy liver, has been shown to actively protect the liver against toxic damage, and even regenerate damaged liver cells. Turmeric also boosts the natural production of bile, shrinks engorged hepatic ducts, and improves overall function of the gallbladder, another body-purifying organ.

Not willing to sit by and see what happens under a Trump presidency, a hearty group of 55 pilgrims has already left Portland, Oregon with the first barge to start a new nation. Their destination, the huge and elusive Great Pacific Garbage Patch. 
The Patch is a huge loose-knit patch of floating garbage, mostly small plastics, that floats with the massive circular currents in the Northern Pacific. The smallest estimate of the size of The Patch is 270,000 square miles, roughly the size of Texas. So there's some room to set up house. 
""It will take us a bit to move in, but it can't be worse than what's coming in the U.S."" said Jennifer Griswell, communications representative. 
The initial group must first stabilize the mass into one unit. Their plan involves an ingenious mix of six-pack rings, dental floss, used plastic diapers, discarded shoes, mattresses, yoga mats and carpet. 
They will have to work fast to claim the territory however. There is a commercial cleanup project that has been brewing since 2012, The Ocean Cleanup, founded by Dutchman Boyan Slat.

21617,L.A. Sheriff Faces Protests for Opposition to ’Sanctuary State’ - Breitbart,"Over 100 people gathered in front of the Hall of Justice in Downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday evening to protest L. A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell’s opposition to State Senate Bill 54, which would declare all of California a “sanctuary state. ”[According to the Los Angeles Daily News, protesters held up signs that read, “One struggle, united” and “We demand immigrant rights. ”  David Abud, with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, reportedly spoke over a loudspeaker against SB 54. He said McDonnell’s “argument is that if we don’t pass this, ICE is going to   our community with deportation. That is a ridiculous argument. ” Last month, 161 illegal aliens were arrested throughout Southern California by federal immigration authorities. (Some raids are reportedly ongoing.) The raids took place over the course of several days and resulted in the arrests of 680 illegal aliens across multiple states. That, in turn, upset many of the state’s Democratic lawmakers. SB 54 was introduced by California State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (  Angeles) in December. In February, Breitbart News reported that de Léon said that “‘half his family’ was in the country illegally, using false documents, and eligible for deportation under President Trump’s new executive order against ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions. ” According to the Daily News, McDonnell wrote to De León earlier this month: “SB 54 would not allow the safe transfer of custody rather it would force immigration enforcement agents into our communities in order to search out and find the person they seek. While doing this, they will most surely cast a wide net over our communities, apprehending and detaining those not originally the target of the enforcement actions. ” Breitbart News reported that on Tuesday, newly   L. A. Mayor Eric Garcetti released a new set of protections for illegal aliens that cement the city’s status as a sanctuary city, and defy the Trump administration’s efforts to ensure compliance with federal law. SB 54 is likewise cast as a direct rejection of President Trump’s recent executive crder, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States. ” The January 25 Executive Order states: “Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic. ”",0

At least one person has been injured in a shooting at an anti-Trump protest in Portland, the United States. 
The incident took place on Morrison Bridge in Portland, police said. “One person down. Everyone needs to leave the area immediately!” police wrote on Twitter. However, nobody leaved the scene. 
According to Police, the possible suspect in the shooting is an “African-American male, late teens, 5’8″, thin, wearing black dark hoodie and saggy blue jeans.” 
The violent protest with protesters throwing projectiles at officers and police deploying tear gas is ongoing the third nigh in a row. Thousands of people have been out in the streets across the US since Trump won the 2016 presidential race on November 8, defeating Hillary Clinton. The protests are massively supported by the mainstream media and Soros-linked non-governmental organizations . 
According to aviable information at least part of protesters is paid to participate in the riots ($15-$18 per hour) . 
Some experts believ ethat the ongoing events in the US look similar to the developments in Ukraine in 2014 when ‘unknown snipers’ shot in the crowd to provoke an additional violence during the protests.

21622,CBO Report: AHCA Drops Number of Insured by 23 Million by 2026 - Breitbart,"The Congressional Budget Office report states that under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) 14 million people will lose insurance in 2018 and 23 million will lose insurance by 2026. [The Congressional Budget Office reported that the legislation would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, mainly because of its cuts to Medicaid and Obamacare insurance subsidies. The final version of the AHCA reduces the deficit by less than $32 billion compared to the previous version.  The House passed the AHCA without a CBO score that would allow lawmakers and the American people to evaluate the bill’s effects on costs and health insurance coverage. Previous versions of the AHCA estimated that 24 million Americans could lose insurance by 2026, while the previous version would save $150 billion over the next ten years. The CBO believes that there are several factors that the AHCA could contribute to the stability of the individual market, including subsidies to purchase insurance, grants patients for   patients through the Patient and State Stability Fund. The budget office added, that although the AHCA’s tax credits are less generous compared to Obamacare’s   subsidies, the tax credits would lower average premiums enough to attract enough healthy people to stabilize the individual health insurance market. The House pushed through the AHCA after they added the MacArthur amendment, which allows states to obtain waivers to repeal Obamacare regulations that raise the cost of premiums, known as community ratings and essential health benefits. Essential Health Benefits require that health insurance plans must cover certain services such as doctors’ services, inpatient or outpatient hospital care, prescription drugs, pregnancy, childbirth, and mental health. Community ratings regulations prevent health insurers from varying premiums within a certain area based on age, gender, or health status. According to the CBO, healthy patients would be able to purchase individual health insurance with relatively low premiums, however, less healthy Americans might have to pay higher premiums, and might lose insurance in states that choose to eliminate Obamacare’s community ratings and essential health benefits regulations. The CBO projected that in 2018, average premiums would rise by about 20 percent in 2018, and 5 percent in 2019, however, in 2020 states will be able to obtain waivers that would rescind Obamacare regulations. The CBO projects: The CBO estimates that the AHCA will reduce Medicaid spending by more than $834 billion over the next ten years, primarily through ending Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and creating a   limit on Medicaid payments. Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden ( ) and Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Burgess ( ) released the following statement, saying that the AHCA will reduce premiums and stabilize the health care market. “The American Health Care Act is the first step in our efforts to repeal Obamacare and rebuild our broken health care system. CBO continues to find that through our   bill, premiums will go down and that our reforms will help stabilize the market,” said chairmen Walden and Burgess. “Our plan puts states and patients in the driver’s seat, creating an innovative fund to help lower premiums and other    costs. As the Senate continues its work on this vital bill, we encourage them to further these critical principles. ” The Department of Health and Human Services released a new report that noted that under Obamacare individual health insurance premiums doubled. House Republicans passed the AHCA earlier this month without waiting for the CBO score. Read the rest of the CBO report here:",0
21623,Americans Trapped Between Fear and Faith,"The result of the 2016 election has thrown this country for a loop. Some celebrate the win of President-elect Donald Trump while others continue to mourn the current president’s ultimate transition of power. A number of Americans are excited to see what a non-politician will do in a political environment, while others are worried that he will maintain the antics that awarded him the Oval Office. The country continues to experience a great divide that has many Americans trapped between fear and faith.
The previous perspective of the nation, according to some, included a series of victories and a country on an incline. However, others disagree by saying President Barak Obama is the worst “thing” to ever happen to the White House. Ironically, many of these same people “believe” racism did not exist until he became president. In the same vein, others feel the division crisis, which includes race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation among other issues will increase with the induction of Trump as the leader of the free world. Today, America is shrouded in a most un-American pessimism as many within this great country remain trapped between fear and faith.
On one side of the divide, there are people who are fed up with the mistreatment and injustice they have experienced. These millennials have decided to take matters into their own hands with protests and other questionable behavior patterns. Undoubtedly, if hope continues to decrease, violence will increase and blood will continue to spill in the earth. 
On the other side, there are people who embrace the faith of a changed country “made great again” with the entrance of new authority. As such, Trump serves as a beacon of hope to his core supporters. He seemingly indulges their ambitions to maintain America’s system of oppression and inspires them in dangerous ways that have the potential to lead to serious consequences. Instead of seeking unity, Americans from all sides are fighting to be right. However, when hate overpowers love, no one is right.
In order to understand the fear surrounding the election results, a conversation would need to take place in search of real issues. Not enough people are interested in problem-solving. Onlookers who criticize and judge a generation that is destroying their town as they march through the streets, only serve as fuel for their fury. People have called them animals and all sorts of derogatory statements, without realizing that it is a terrible thing to feel trapped or caged. Before adding insult to injury, it may help if “outsiders” were more empathetic to their experience.
The crisis of America will not change simply by the transference of power; it can only be made better by the conveyance of love. It is time for Americans join together and bridge the gap between fear and faith with the spread love as they continue to seek change. Otherwise, things will get worse.
In many corners of the country and across the globe, the calamity has been met with love, compassion, and sympathy as people from all lifestyles join in a time of celebration and mourning. Even still, if people are not careful hate will find a way to slide through the cracks. However, if given the chance love will always prevail.
People’s view of the election is based on their experiences. Allow them to embrace their feelings and encourage them to find peace. Today the sitting President and President-elect met for the first time and did just that! Why? Because love still trumps hate.

21624,Clinton Pulls Up In Pickup To Bring Illegal Mexicans To Vote,"0 Add Comment 
IN A last ditch effort to rile support this morning, presidential candidate for the Democratic party Hillary Clinton was spotted in Florida driving a pickup truck full of illegal Mexican workers to a local voting centre. 
It is understood the 69-year-old is to spend the majority of the day shuttling the demographic to polling stations across the key state, who have long been publicly chastised by Republican candidate Donald Trump for working illegally in America. 
“We expect Hillary to bring over one hundred thousand illegals to voting booths today,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook explains, “she is a very dedicated woman, and if anything this shows that. Hopefully this will be enough to swing it in Florida”. 
Mr. Trump previously threatened to build a wall on the border of Mexico if elected – one of the main cornerstones of his campaign – but this later backfired due to the fact that America is a pluralistic society and 59% of all unauthorized immigrants in the US hold residence in the 6 key voting states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. 
“He really shot himself in the foot with that one,” Mook added, “He should have been nice to the illegals, like we’ve been, and then deal with them later if that’s what keeps us popular. Which we’ll probably do, once we’ve got what we wanted from them”. 
The Trump campaign’s decision to begin building walls around polling stations has been criticised by election experts, who have said he should have begun construction months ago. 
“It was build walls around polling stations months ago or stop being such a racist dick, but obviously only one of these things was possible,” an election expert explained.",0
21627,Monsieur Malbrough est Mort | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: Европа В своей новой статье французский обозреватель Жан Перье напоминает недавно опубликованный им сюжет « Marlbrough s ’ en va - t - en Guerre » на фоне последних политических событий и растерянности европейского политического истеблишмента от выборов в США нового 45-го президента. В числе политиков, продемонстрировавших замешательство от победы Трампа, оказался и Ф.Олланд . Тем не менее он призвал «извлечь уроки» из результатов американских выборов, значение которых «выходит далеко за пределы Соединенных Штатов». Эти слова французского президента, по мнению автора, оказались пророческими и за ними последовало предложение от 152 депутатов из 199 от правоцентристской республиканской партии за импичмент президенту Франсуа Олланду . Правые парламентарии обвиняют Олланда за разглашение государственной тайны, которое, по их мнению, он допустил в своей книге « Президент не должен был этого говорить ». По их мнению, президенту Франции не следовало говорить о многих опубликованных в книге сведениях и оценках, особенно об операциях французских спецслужб по физическому устранению в других странах особо опасных исламских радикалов. Указанные шаги парламентариев, не зависимо от дальнейшего решения вопроса по объявлению импичмента Ф.Олланду, фактически ставят крест на его дальнейшей политической карьере. То есть можно сказать словами все той же народной французской песни: «… Monsieur Malbrough est mort » (т.е. «Мальбрук теперь мертв»). Однако это предложение французских парламентариев об импичменте Ф.Олланда вряд ли можно считать неожиданностью. Достаточно вспомнить недавнее подведение итогов пятилетнего пребывания Ф.Олланда в Елисейском дворце журналом Le Figaro . Уровень доверия президенту достиг исторического минимума в 11% респондентов. Никогда Президент Республики не падал так низко! Автор отмечает, что участь Олланда в ближайшие месяцы может разделить и ряд других политических лидеров Европы, чьей основной задачей последнего времени была активная поддержка агрессивных планов администрации Обамы в ущерб европейским ценностям и международному праву.

21632,Alec Baldwin Denies ’SNL’ Impression Helped Trump Win,"Alec Baldwin’s mocking parody of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live has helped propel the show to its strongest ratings in years  —   but the actor denies that the   impression helped Trump win the White House in November. [In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph to promote his latest animated film, The Boss Baby, the    actor said that people had approached him after the election to tell him that his impression helped smooth out Trump’s edges and had helped “humanize” him.  “There were people who came to me after the election and said, ‘Well, how do you feel that you are, to some degree, responsible for Trump winning the election? ’” he told the outlet. “I thought they were kidding, but they said, ‘You humanised him. You took the edges off and made him more personable. ’” “I don’t agree with that,” he added. Baldwin debuted as Trump during the 42nd season premiere of SNL in October last year. The show’s skits initially mocked the debates between Trump and former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and after Trump won, they took aim at the president’s penchant for tweeting and for his confrontation with the 9th Circuit Court over his executive orders on immigration. Baldwin has previously said that playing Trump is “not always fun,” and recently said he planned to retire the impression in the near future. “As an actor who studies other people, I was completely convinced that when Trump won, he would completely transform himself,” the actor told the Telegraph. “Like in sports, when you beat the hell out of somebody and you win, you shake hands, maybe have a beer together, and you’re a more polite, obliging person. But with Trump, there was none of that. ” “He was as bitter and miserable after he won as he was before. That is a complete mystery to me,” he added. Offscreen, Baldwin has been a fierce critic of the president. On the eve of Trump’s inauguration, the actor appeared at a rally outside Trump Tower in Manhattan alongside other   celebrities including Michael Moore, Robert De Niro and Mark Ruffalo. Baldwin has also teased Trump on Twitter. But the actor says that despite his skewering of the president, he does not see his impression as being part of a larger “resistance” against Trump. “People thank me for ‘the resistance’ that I’m participating in, but I don’t see it that way,” he told the Telegraph. “I don’t mind if people do, but I don’t do it for that reason. I do it to entertain people. It’s purely about entertainment. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0

The last remaining food rations are being distributed in besieged rebel-held eastern districts of the Syrian city of Aleppo, the UN has said. Humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland warned that without a resupply there would be no food left to hand out next week to the 275,000 people living there. Mr Egeland ruled out airdrops of food, explaining that they were not possible in densely-populated urban areas. Government forces launched a major assault on eastern Aleppo in September. Since then, troops have pushed into several outlying areas with the help of Iranian-backed Shia militias and Russian air strikes. Rebels launched a counter-attack in an attempt to break the siege in late October. But their progress slowed after early gains.",0
21634,"Trump’s 1st Win: Germany Hints at Compromises on Trade, Military","As President Trump finished his first 24 hours in office by attending an interfaith prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral, German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to seek compromises with the new President on trade and military spending issues. [Speaking at a news conference in   Germany, Merkel sought to be a peacemaker after the German Vice Chancellor and leader of the   Social Democrats, Sigmar Gabriel, lashed out against Donald Trump’s election the day before as the result of “a bad radicalization. ”  Gabriel scoffed at the new president’s inaugural speech as nationalist and protectionist. He boasted that although Trump may be a rough ride, “We should neither be submissive nor have fear. ” He threatened that if President Trump wants a trade war, “Europe and Germany need a strategy geared toward Asia and China and we have new opportunities. ” But with $111 billion in exports to the U. S. and only $49 billion of U. S. imports, Chancellor Angela Merkel fully understands that the German economy would risk great damage in a trade war with the America. In trying to chart a conciliatory posture toward Trump, Merkel acknowledged: “He made his convictions clear in his inauguration speech. ” She expressed a new willingness to compromise on trade and NATO military spending by stating: “I say two things with regards to this (speech): first, I believe firmly that it is best for all of us if we work together based on rules, common values and joint action in the international economic system, in the international trade system, and make our contributions to the military alliances. ” The political   follows a   joint   by President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel confronting   Donald Trump that “there will be no return to a   world. ” The two world leaders emphasized, “We have a responsibility to our companies and citizens  —   actually, the entire global community  —   to enhance and deepen our cooperation. ” Germany has long considered a strong alliance with the United States to be a cornerstone of its foreign policy, and it will do everything it can to protect that partnership, according to Stratfor Global Intelligence. From a balance of payments deficit 15 years ago, Germany’s trade surplus with the United States has grown to almost 9 percent of Germany’s Gross Domestic Product. Despite a $62 billion surplus with the U. S. in 2016, America still funds and operates the 174 “base sites” in Germany, according to the Pentagon Budget. President Trump is not the first U. S. president to demand greater defense spending from NATO’s European members, but he is the first openly to label the alliance as obsolete and hint America might refuse to protect members that fail to contribute 2 percent of GDP. In a sign of arrogance just two days before the Trump inaugural, Germany’s defense minister announced that Berlin would increase 2017 military spending by $2. 1 billion to $39 billion in 2017, only 1. 2 percent of its GDP. With Germany enjoying the world’s largest current account surplus at $281 billion, President Trump, under existing U. S. law, can introduce “temporary safeguards” such as tariffs, to protect domestic industries threatened by certain imports. Although Trump cannot designate a country without new congressional legislation, he can   luxury cars and basically shut down German exports of Mercedes and BMW to the U. S. The Trump team has not announced if they will attend the Munich Security Conference from Feb.  . But Germany will try to leverage its current   presidency to secure more face time with U. S. leaders during a conference of foreign affairs ministers in Bonn from Feb.   and a larger summit with President Trump and top heads of state in Hamburg on July  . Chancellor Merkel has promised to visit the United States this spring to meet President Trump for the first time, as preparation for the Hamburg   summit.  ",0

21636,Fencer Is First American Olympian to Compete in a Head Scarf - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Drawn to fencing as a teenager because the athletes compete while fully covered, Ibtihaj Muhammad on Monday became the first United States Olympian in any sport to compete at a Games while wearing a hijab. Muhammad, a   Olympian at age 30, came from behind to edge a Ukranian fencer, Olena Kravatska,   in the round of 32 of the women’s saber competition, but she lost later Monday, to Cécilia Berder of France,   in the round of 16. Saber is the quickest and most aggressive of the fencing disciplines. Fencers score quickly, slashing for points, without a lot of the fancy parrying of foil fencing. Milliseconds can separate a winning touch from one that is too slow. Wearing a mask emblazoned with the American flag, Muhammad punctuated her scores with roars of delight and showed visible frustration when calls did not go her way. “I always say that in a sport like fencing, you’re your own biggest opponent,” she said afterward. “If you can control yourself and your nerves and your emotions, and execute the actions that you want, you’ll always be successful, and I failed to do that today. “This has been a beautiful experience for me. I know that this was written for me, the chips fell where they did, and I feel proud to represent Team U. S. A. even in defeat. ” Muhammad, of Maplewood, N. J. first tried fencing at age 13. When she competed in softball, tennis, track and volleyball, her mother, Denise, adjusted her uniforms in accordance with the family’s Muslim faith, adding stretch pants for track and sweatpants for volleyball. “My parents were on a mission to find a sport without alteration,” Muhammad said in an interview in February. Muhammad said of her hijab: “People ask Muslim women about it  —   not just athletes  —   all the time. Like, aren’t you hot? On a hot day, you’d still wear a shirt and pants. I would not leave the house without it. ” Muhammad’s accomplishments led to an invitation to join President Obama when he made his first visit as president to an American mosque in Baltimore in February. Muhammad was among the prominent American Muslims invited to a   discussion with Mr. Obama before his speech. After losing on Monday, she said that many people in America, both Muslims and   did not believe Muslim women participated in sports. “I want to break cultural norms and show girls that it’s important to be active it’s important to be involved in sport,” she said. The other American in the saber competition, Mariel Zagunis, the gold medalist in 2004 and 2008, also lost in the round of 16.

TRUTH REVOLT 
There’s a lot of accusations going around that the 2016 election is rigged. From Democrats suggesting Russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves Democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome. 
President Obama has laughed off the notion that Bernie Sanders was forced out by the DNC and believes Donald Trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged. And of course, Obama would never admit that Hillary Clinton could do something wrong. But candidate Obama, in 2008, sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him. 
Video of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he doesn’t believe in the possibility: 
“Well, I tell you what: it helps in Ohio that we’ve got Democrats in charge of the machines. [Cheering] But look, I come from Chicago, so I want to be honest, it’s not as if it’s just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past, sometimes Democrats have too.

21640,Russian Antarctic expedition to resume drilling works at subglacial Lake Vostok - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
ST. PETERSBURG, November 8. /TASS/. Russian researchers plan to resume drilling works at the world’s deepest well of about four kilometers which leads to Lake Vostok, the biggest subglacial lake in Antarctica, chief of the Russian Antarctic expedition Valery Lukin told TASS on Monday. 
“We plan to resume drilling works at Lake Vostok, despite the fact that funding of the entire program of the expedition has remained at the last year’s level, or slightly more than one billion rubles ($15.67 million),” he said, adding that last year saw a break in the works at Lake Vostok as the most money consuming in the entire expedition’s program. 
According to Lukin, the plan for this Antarctic summer season is to expand the well’s lower section to prevent water rise in the well during the next, third, drilling attempt to reach the lake’s water, like it happened during the first two attempts. 
It is not yet decided whether the third attempt to reach the lake’s water will be made this year. “Most likely, we will not have enough time for that during this season but still there is a chance for that,” he said. 
Researchers plan to arrive at the Vostok station located near the subglacial lake on December 6 and finish their mission in early February. 
This year, the Russian Antarctic expedition will use three ships to get to the destination. Thus, the Akademik Fedorov is scheduled to sail off on November 12, the Akademik Tereshnikov — on November 19, and the Akademik Karpinsky — in late November. The seasonal expedition, according to Lukin, will include 120 specialists. As many as 110 polar explorers will spend the next winter at five round-the-year Antarctic stations. 
Lake Vostok, measuring 250 by 50 kilometers, was discovered by the 33rd Russian Antarctic Expedition in 1987. It lies beneath some four kilometers of ice. Drilling was launched in 1989. In February 2012, researchers reached the watershed and took the first samples of water, which were found to contain traces of living organisms, hitherto unknown cold-resistant bacteria. However there was no 100% guarantee that these bacteria had originated from the subglacial lake, since water samples were polluted with priming water from the well. Months later, however, the water in the lake rose and froze at the level of 363 meters. The explorers had to drill a new well parallel to the old one from the depth of 3,406 meters.

Fifteen minutes after Sharma-Mistry’s press conference, Ratan Rata called for a press conference and announced the group’s decision to reinstate Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Group. 
“Mr. Sharma-Mistry is a rare talent who will be groomed for the future,” said Tata. “The Trustees and other directors of Tata Sons are convinced about Mr. Sharma-Mistry’s ability and firmly believe that when he gets going, he can turn around any business within one quarter.” 
Later, our correspondent reached out to the jubilant Sharma-Mistry and asked him what gave him this idea. Sharma-Mistry said that the emotional atyachar at Tata Sons was irking him, but then he met an inspired god man from Chennai, Cheeni Mama, who gave him guidance. 
Mr Sharma-Mistry is now considering building a temple for Cheeni Mama. “After all, our organization is known for its charitable acts, and in TN it is accepted practice to build a temple for actors, so this is very well in line with our organizational ethos,” Sharma-Mistry was quoted as saying.

21651,#NotMyPresident? Take the #ClintonPledge!,"11/15/2016 at 6:06 am 
Even after the election the Clinton side continues with lawless agitation, intimidation and violence in the streets, demonstrating to reasonable people everywhere that Americans did make the right choice. Thank you MSM and Mr. Soros for showing everyone just how free, democratic, big hearted and open the globalist new world order would really be if Hillary had won. 
If the US election rules had been that the candidates had to win the popular vote in order to be elected, then Trump would have campaigned more vigorously in the large cities and likely also would have won that contest in a landslide. But how much more of a landslide that would have been can be seen by considering what really happened. 
The people who supported Trump mainly voted for jobs and to save core values and constitutional rights from a misguided globalism being imposed upon them. They were essentially voting to save their nation from an establishment which has been systematically outsourcing just about everything which matters to them. However, despite the stakes they were and remain essentially principled people adhering to the electoral rules of fair play for lawful democratic change. The Clinton side on the other hand appeared devoid of any real principles other than their own interests. During the election the Clinton side used intimidation tactics of paid agitators. They cheated by swelling voters lists by opening the border and signing up droves of illegal immigrants. Even voter fraud and rigged voting machines were acceptable to them. But most of all they were supported by an absolutely biased, corrupt and lying mainstream media. The effect of the media was so pervasive that Trump supporters were generally so ridiculed and shunned that few made their views known. Without such dishonest, illegal and oppressive tactics by the Clinton side, the Trump vote would most certainly have been much much greater. In the circumstances the Clinton loss could not be more embarrassing for her, her party and the MSM.

21652,"Trump Compares Himself To Veterans, Says Heâ€™s Brave; Military Explodes.","Share on Facebook 
Over the course of the presidential campaign, Donald Trump has found himself on the wrong side of issues relating to U.S. military veterans. Trump, unlike even other Republicans, has insulted veterans and used them as props to boost his campaign. 
With less than a week to go until the presidential election, Trump is back to his old dirty tricks with veterans. With Medal of Honor recipients seated behind him, Donald Trump tells supporters: ""I'm brave — financially brave."" https://t.co/uWUUhCtQso pic.twitter.com/EDd7F0PLHT 
— ABC News (@ABC) November 4, 2016 
The Republican presidential candidate was listing the Medal of Honor recipients at the rally, when he stopped and said, “Oh, they’re so much more brave than me. I wouldn’t have done what they did.” 
But, that self-deprecation didn’t last long. 
“I’m brave in other ways,” he said at the rally in Selma, a town 45 miles southeast of Raleigh. “I’m brave — I’m financially brave. Big deal, right? These are real brave.” 
Medal of Honor honorees are given their medals for demonstrating extraordinary valor in combat, under fire. By comparison Trump has always led a life of privilege, including the way he avoided being drafted to serve in Vietnam, by citing mysterious “bone spurs” that disqualified him from going into the armed forces. Coincidentally, those debilitating “bone spurs” never showed up on Trump’s official medical records. 
Other instances of Trump insulting the military include his attack on Khizr Khan, the father of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in Iraq. Trump claimed that he had suffered “sacrifices” like the Khans as well, while building luxury apartments and hosting a reality TV show. 
Trump insulted Senator John McCain, who spent years in a Vietnamese POW camp. When he disagreed with McCain, Trump said he liked soldiers “who don’t get captured,” spitting in the face of the hundreds of prisoners of war. 
The nominee also used veterans as human shields while he was feuding with Fox News. Trump claimed he was holding a fundraiser for veterans when he decided to boycott a primary debate co-moderated by Megyn Kelly. But it turned out he never bothered to donate the money he had promised veterans until he was publicly shamed on being a cheapskate by the Washington Post .

21657,Russia Warns US In Total Breakdown After FBI Notifies Obama All Hillary Emails Found,"
A chilling Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MoFA ) “urgent action” report issued to all Federation ministries within the past hour is warning that the United States is now suffering a complete breakdown in its normal governmental functions after the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) notified President Obama that all of Hillary Clinton’s believed to be deleted and/or destroyed secret emails have now been completely recovered . [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to a Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) addendum to this MoFA “urgent action” report, the FBI was able to recover all of Hillary Clinton’s once secret emails from the computer shared by her campaign vice chairman Huma Abedin and sexual deviant husband Anthony Weiner— both of whom are now under the protection of the FBI as “cooperating witnesses” against Hillary Clinton.
To exactly how all of Hillary Clinton’s secret emails and documents ended up on the Abedin-Weiner laptop computer, the SVR explains, was due to its use of the Outlook and IMAP email protocols that will sync any folder, on any device, they are told to monitor and can be told to make local copies of emails —which simply means that Abedin used the laptop computer she shared with her disgraced husband to back up every communication Hillary Clinton ever made—and that numbered 650,000 copies of emails, documents and other communications .
Unbeknownst, however, to both Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, and everyone else aiding their criminality, this report continues, is that when the US Congress ordered all of these secret emails turned over to them, Clinton, in turn, ordered them all destroyed —but with her, and those aiding her, failing to realize that when these emails were “bleached” (a computer program used to destroy hard drives) from her secret private server they did so with it offline, meaning that it wasn’t able to “backtrack” to the Abedin-Weiner laptop to destroy all of the backups emails, documents and communications discovered by the FBI .
Though the exact contents of these now discovered Hillary Clinton secret emails it is not fully “known/understood” by the SVR, this report notes, the FBI agents who have been documenting their contents have become so horrified by what they’re discovering they are now reporting to the American press that Hillary Clinton is the “antichrist personified” .
Even worse, this report continues, with new Wikileaks showing that not only is Hillary Clinton and her criminal money laundering organization, known as the Clinton Foundation, being investigated by the FBI, nearly every other US intelligence and tax agency have, likewise, begun investigations too .
Thus leading, this report gravely explains, to a complete breakdown in the rule of law in the United States as the main investigators into Hillary Clinton’s crimes are all now known to be her supporters who have received tens-of-millions of dollars in “gifts/bribes” to protect her —and that led former CIA agent and American diplomat Dr. Steve Pieczenik to personally notify President Putin this past week that the US intelligence community has now launched a counter-coup against Hillary Clinton .

This report concludes by noting that not only did Dr. Pieczenik take the extraordinary “measure/step” of informing President Putin of this US intelligence community counter-coup, he also posted his warning to YouTube for all of the American people to see too—but that in spite of its extraordinarily being viewed by over 2.5 million of these peoples in less than 24 hours , the Hillary Clinton supporting global tech giant Google has suppressed this fact from its main trends— giving the top place, instead, to a video mocking Americans that has only 1.6 million views , and that stunningly doesn’t include Dr. Pieczenik’s warning video at all .

21660,How Jared Kushner’s Call to Canada Saved NAFTA,"President Donald Trump’s    and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, played a key role in the Trump administration’s decision to back down from its threat to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). [Exactly what that role involved, however, is a matter of dispute. Kushner was a conduit between Canadian officials and the Trump administration but accounts differ about the details.  Last month, various news reports said that Trump was preparing to invoke Article 2205 of NAFTA, the first step in withdrawing from the trade agreement that the U. S. president had attacked so fiercely on the campaign trail. Several hours later, however, the administration appeared to reverse course, saying Trump had been persuaded by the leaders of Mexico and Canada to stay in the deal. “Two people that I like very much, the president of Mexico, prime minister of Canada, they called up, they said, can we negotiate? I said yes, we can renegotiate,” Trump explained at a rally in Pennsylvania a few days later. The events of April 26 set off a torrent of speculation about what really happened inside the White House. Some said that the administration had been bluffing all along, using the talk about the withdrawal to get Canada and Mexico to take seriously its plans to renegotiate the trade agreement. Others said the turnaround reflected a struggle within the White House between economic nationalists like chief strategist Steve Bannon and National Trade Council chief Peter Navarro and globalist hardliners such as National Economic Council head Gary Cohn. Bannon and Navarro had reportedly drafted an executive order that would have initiated the withdrawal process. The globalists in the business community had sprung into action following reports on the imminent order from from the New York Times, CNN and others. Now reports have emerged that put Kushner at the center of the globalist effort to save NAFTA. According to the news service The Canadian Press, Kushner called the chief of staff of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to suggest that the prime minister immediately call Trump.  The staffer, Katie Telford, called the prime minister who then called Trump, according to the Canadian Press. White House officials tell a slightly different story. They say that Kushner was contacted by Trudeau or his aides earlier in the day, and that Kushner agreed to set up a time for a phone call later in the day. The two stories differ about who reached out to whom first. They agree, however, that Kushner’s call to the Canadians is what prompted the call between Trump and Trudeau that the U. S. president says convinced him to back away from exiting NAFTA.",0

21668,International Criminal Court rejected by Russia and the multi-polar world,"November 21, 2016 - Fort Russ News - 
- Ronald ZONCA , in Boulevard Voltaire, translated by Tom Winter -   

It has to be said: the International Criminal Court is just another means of repression and oppression of sovereign peoples. 
Russia has just signified its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC) in view of its inefficiency and its partiality in choosing what to investigate. A reading of the ""Report on Preliminary Examination Activities in 2016"" proves that it's a matter of justice by fiat. 

The case of Ukraine is particularly revealing. This country is not a signatory to the Rome Statute and therefore does not recognize the ICC. But it intervenes on complaints filed by the current government, even though the current government came out of a coup d'etat. 

The investigations concern only the snipers of the Maïdan, the Donbass, and the Crimea. There were no investigations into the Odessa fire, where 50 people were burnt alive, nor on the cut-off of water and electricity in the Crimea, which could be described as a crime against humanity. 

The case of Ukraine's winter power cut deserves our attention. 

This has done serious injury to the inhabitants of Crimea because it means an end to water distribution, the pumps being inoperative, and to heating, as the boilers can not function. Responsibility for this cut is claimed by Tatar activists. The leaders of these activists are not only not prosecuted but are heard on allegations of abuse of the Crimean Tatars. 

Let us recall that Crimean Tatars also live in the Crimea and have suffered the consequences of cuts in electricity and water. 

Among the few convictions, the Milošević case is exemplary. He is a man who suffered eleven years of pre-trial detention, died in suspicious prison conditions, and who has just been cleared this year by the same court that sentenced him. 

Though the ICC aspires to world jurisdiction, given that major states such as China, India, and Russia are not or are no longer signatories to the Rome Statute that founded the ICC, the legitimacy of this body is therefore only Western. African states such as South Africa, Guinea and Burundi have left the institution, tired of seeing Africa hosting all the ICC field offices. The New York office acts in a liaison role, not to say a directory, nor an investigative role. 

The ICC, the UN, the IMF and other institutions of coercion fulfill their missions. These institutions were created by the US, for the US, and they support them in their attempt to dominate the world. 

The peoples are no longer able to turn away from the values of humanism, justice, the right to self-determination, and they see multipolarity as a prerequisite for existence and independence. A free world is first and foremost a multipolar world. 

The United States is a great nation. Paraphrasing Churchill, we can say that i f other nations are ready to learn from this great and respectable people, they do not intend to be taught every day. 

After 14 years of operation, it is clear that the ICC is just one more organ for the repression and oppression of sovereign peoples.

21669,Heavy Rains Spawn California Wildflower Super Bloom that Can Be Seen from Space - Breitbart,"Ending the drought environmentalists called “permanent,” the heavy rains that hit California over the last few months have spawned a wildflower super bloom that can actually be seen from space. [California has suffered a   drought that threatened the whole state —  draining reservoirs, forcing water bans, and threatening farms —  but after seeing over ten inches of spring rains, the state is in bloom again, The Washington Post reported.  The best proof of the amazing change brought by the   rains is the    satellite photos taken across the state, photos that show the amazing greening of California. The California Poppy Reserve is a perfect example. A satellite photo of the region taken in 2016 shows a giant brown patch spotted in a few mottled green spaces. Yet, a photo taken this year shows rich greens and large swaths of poppy orange blooms covering vast areas. Photos from the Carrizo Plain show a similar change. In 2016 the whole area was a dismal brown. Now it rebounds with green. The images of the Los Padres National Forest are even more dramatic, going from the very definition of barren to an area covered in lush greens. Even as environmentalists insisted that California was in a permanent drought that would never again be relieved, after the rounds of massive storms that covered the state in water, now only two percent of the state is still experiencing drought. Indeed, in a major turnaround, instead of worrying about a lack of water, many portions of the Golden State are experiencing flood warnings.

21682,College threatens police response for students wearing 'offensive' costumes,"College threatens police response for students wearing 'offensive' costumes   Source: Fox News 
Tufts University has sent out a letter that is sure to spook Greek life students ahead of Halloween weekend. 
Students involved in fraternities and sororities at the Massachusetts school are being told to not wear anything that could offend others during Halloween celebrations – or risk getting investigated by campus police and being slapped with “serious disciplinary sanctions.” 
The order came in a note written by the leaders of the four Greek life councils on campus. It contained few specifics. 
“The costumes that people choose to wear have an effect on everyone around them whether they realize it or not,” the letter says . 
It goes on to state that “outfits relating to tragedy, controversy, or acts of violence are also inappropriate. We need to set a precedent that people’s customs cannot and will not be our costumes.” 
Tufts was far from the only university calling out costumes it deemed offensive. The University of Florida offered counseling for students ""troubled"" by incidents involving Halloween costumes. And the University of Wisconsin-Platteville's Bias Incident Team last year claimed some students' ""Three Blind Mice"" costumes mocked the disabled .",0

This election is one to be studied for years to come. I cannot, with certainty, predict the outcome, although my gut tells me that Hillary will APPEAR to win, via massive vote and electronic machine rigging and hacking, but that Donald Trump CAN successfully litigate to prove this and thus reverse such an outcome. Rest assured there is more than enough skullduggery to go around (on the Democratic side, and limited on the Republican side to the Bush Dynasty and their neo-con front.) I admit my gut feeling may be absolutely wrong: Donald Trump may win by such a landslide that the Soros-Hillary strategy may be “aborted.” This would be good! (I would also relish the humiliation of the Bush Machine! I want to see them gnash their teeth!) I also follow Dr. Steve Piecenzik, who declared on Alex Jones’s radio show on Tue., Nov. 1st, that a “silent coup” is under way in America. He announced that various intelligence sources in the U.S. have been the source of the Wikileaks program. He said that there are certain elements in the intelligence community that have made it clearly known to the Hillary Camp that she will not be allowed to serve. Let us hope that this maintains. 
In the meantime, we still have our own bubbles to pop out of. I admit I do. There is so much more to study and learn. And it shall be HIGH TIME for the former Goldwater Girl (gone Mad!), Hillary, the Klownish Koughing Kween, to be dumped into the Ashbin of History.

Three months after the investigation was closed, FBI director James Comey said he found more emails that were ""pertinent"" to the investigation of Ms Clinton’s personal email server, which Ms Clinton had been accused of misusing during her tenure as secretary of state. 
“In previous congressional testimony I refer to the fact that the FBI has completed its investigation of former secretary Clinton’s personal email server,"" Mr Comey said. 
""Due to recent developments I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. Related Articles FBI Successfully Recovers Hillary Clinton’s Deleted Emails 
""In connection with an unrelated case the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent, and I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and I agreed the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."" 
He said he ""cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant"", and did not say how long the investigation would take. 
The new investigation is reportedly not related to WikiLeaks. 
The email controversy has dogged Ms Clinton's campaign for months. 
She repeatedly said she handed over 33,000 emails to the FBI and the Justice Department to determine whether she had sent or received top secret or classified information on an unsecured server. 
The FBI also denied a ""quid pro quo"" arrangement with the state department to downgrade certain information in the emails from ""classified"" to ""unclassified"" . 
Mr Comey told the Justice Department in July that although Ms Clinton had displayed ""extreme carelessness"" which could have lead to adversaries hacking her account, he did not recommend any criminal charges. 
The Justice Department decided to clear the presidential nominee of all charges the same month. 
It is not yet known where these new emails came from or what they say. The Clinton campaign has not yet commented. 
As the news broke, Ms Clinton was flying to Iowa to speak alongside women's rights leaders at two rallies. 
At a rally in New Hampshire, Donald Trump told the crowds: ""Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let take her criminal scheme into the oval office. 
""I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to write the horrible mistake that they made."" 
He has previously said Ms Clinton should be behind bars and accused her of ""deleting thousands of emails"" to hide them from the FBI, which Ms Clinton denied. 
The news was also jumped on by Republicans including house speaker Paul Ryan, who said Ms Clinton had ""nobody but herself to blame but herself"". 
""She was entrusted with our nation's most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information,"" he said in a statement, renewing his call to exclude Ms Clinton from any classified briefings until the matter was ""fully resolved"". 
Along with the investigation over her emails sent and received as secretary of state, the US government recently accused Russia of hacking emails from the Democratic National Convention, which exposed Ms Clinton's team's planned smear of former opponent Bernie Sanders. Related Articles",0

21691,"At Yosemite, a Mystery Bride and Groom Are Identified - The New York Times","It was like a moment from a Disney movie. Mike Karas, a tourist from Honolulu, had his camera pointed toward an exquisite view of Yosemite when a bride and her groom stepped onto a rocky ledge high above a valley. She turned to him as the sun burst into an apricot hue on the horizon. “It was like wow, that’s amazing,” Mr. Karas, 31, said. He snapped a photo. But the mystery couple vanished down a trail before he could flag them down. Later, he posted the image to Instagram, where it spread like crazy and inspired reports as far away as New Zealand. It also fueled an effort to identify the couple that stretched for days. Then, late Tuesday, the mystery was solved. The bride was Catherine Mack, an Australian actress, and her groom Rick Donald, also an actor. Mr. Karas said he spoke to Ms. Mack by phone after she spotted the photo on social media and connected with him. “She was laughing and happy about the photo and the whole story and loved it,” he said. “She didn’t know how big exactly the story had become. ” Ms. Mack said in an email that the couple were married in the national park right before the photo was taken.",0
21694,French Police Defy Their Unions to Vote For Le Pen,"Despite being told by their unions not to vote for   migration presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, many French police are voting for Le Pen, who they feel will restore law and order to France. [The police union “Alliance” have made it clear that they want officers in their union not to vote for Marine Le Pen on their website saying they want to, “block the candidate who challenges social democracy. ” The National Union of Independent Trade Unions have proclaimed the same message but many police say they will vote for Le Pen because they feel she can restore order to the streets of France plagued by violence and terrorism L’Express reports.  One of these officers is    Lucas who said that he had initially voted for the   candidate   Melenchon in the first round. Explaining why he will be voting for Le Pen he said, “I want things to change,” and didn’t believe that Macron’s policies were any different from the mainstream parties. Lucas said that he didn’t fully agree with Le Pen’s stance on migration, but her policies regarding law and order spoke to him as a police officer. At the moment, he said, “the rights of those held in police custody are more taken into account than those of the victims. ” Arnaud, an officer in Savoy, agreed with Lucas saying, “if the policemen vote Le Pen it is mainly for the security policies. I vote FN by default because there are no candidates who match me. ” The    also had choice words for Le Pen’s globalist rival Emmanuel Macron saying he was, “haughty and typically corresponds to the Parisian city dweller. ” Arnaud noted that it was not just in Paris where terror attacks have occurred and he is afraid Macron will reduce the number of officers in the future. “When one knows the realities of the ground,” voting for Le Pen is the logical choice said    Pierre who has been a Front National supporter for 30 years. “Security has to be a priority, everything stems from that,” he said. The officers are also supported by the majority of the armed police, known as the Gendarmerie, as a poll showed 51 percent supporting Le Pen in the first round and likely more in the second. Police are often on the receiving end of violence from   extremists as was the case earlier this week when several officers were injured during an   Pen march after extremists threw firebombs at them. Police are also targets for radical Islamic extremists and Islamic state terrorist fighters. Last month a police officer was gunned down on the Champs Elysee by a known Islamic radical and last year another Islamist invaded the home of a senior officer in Paris stabbing him and his wife to death.

21700,Bundy Brothers Acquitted For Takeover Of Oregon Wildlife Refuge (DETAILS),"Bundy Brothers Acquitted For Takeover Of Oregon Wildlife Refuge (DETAILS) By Kay Smythe   
A group of anti-government protesters, led by brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy have been acquitted of federal conspiracy and weapons charges. This comes after almost a year since the group staged an armed takeover of a federal wildlife sanctuary in Oregon last winter. 
All seven defendants were acquitted by a Federal District Court. Swayed Jury 
The decision came as a surprise to government prosecutors, who had argued that the group used force and threats of violence to occupy the reserve. Despite this, the jury was taken by the group’s protest of government overreach. They also believed the group posed no threat to the public. 
Ryan Bundy’s wife, Angela Bundy , said this following the court’s decision: “I knew that what my husband was doing was right, but I was nervous because the judge was controlling the narrative. But they saw the truth. I am just so grateful they saw it.” What Happened? 
The original crime of the group consisted of occupying a remote wildlife reserve in the south-east of Oregon. The group held the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters for nearly six weeks in 2015. 
As a group, the defendants never denied their occupation. However, their lawyers argued that the prosecutors had failed to prove that they had committed any crimes. 
Their lawyers also stated that the Bundy brothers and five friends did not engage in an illegal conspiracy to keep federal workers from doing their jobs. 
Despite this, all members of the group were charged with conspiracy to impede federal employees from discharging their duties. They also faced federal weapons charges. Cleared Of All Crimes Except For One 
Though the acquittals were unanimous, Ryan Bundy has still been charged with theft. He removed cameras around the refuge, which are government property. 
Oregon’s governor, Kate Brown , has said she is disappointed in the court’s decision. Said said: “The occupation of the Malheur Reserve did not reflect the Oregon way of respectfully working together to resolve differences.” Religious Beliefs 
Ammon Bundy testified in his defense for three days. He claimed the takeover was spontaneous and informed by religious beliefs. Many of the protesters that joined the brothers and their group also had a distrust of government. 
Most of those involved have reportedly been very outspoken on their apprehensions of federal government. Many of them left their jobs and homes to join the protest. 
Despite the verdict, the Judge moved to keep the brothers in federal custody as a result of pending charges in Nevada. About Kay Smythe

21702,Palestinian Jihadist: Ban Christmas Celebrations in Islamic States,"Abu Omar Almaqdesi, a senior   Islamic State jihadist, said the soldiers and supporters of the Caliphate must not permit the celebration of Christmas in Islamic countries. He went on to describe the festivities as depraved, lewd and based on the “blasphemous idea” that Allah had an equal in Jesus.[ “Isa (Jesus) may he rest in peace, is a prophet like all the others,” Almeqdesi told Breitbart Jerusalem “and in Islam we don’t discriminate between prophets for they are all the messengers of Allah, but the claim that Jesus is a deity represents a heresy that ought to be stamped out in Islamic states. ”   “Those Christians who pay the jizya  —   the poll tax  —   and refrain from practicing these blasphemous celebrations should be given the security they deserve. But if somewhere there are Christians who insist on celebrating Christmas with the support of the heretic authorities, one must unleash upon them all one’s might and deploy all the available means. ” Asked what he means by that, Almeqdesi said that “all methods are admissible when it comes to preventing blasphemy against Allah and his commandments. Yes, including killing and blowing up. But, like I said, we believe that at first you should act politely and explain that living in Islamic countries is conditioned on accepting the Sharia and refrain from openly practicing  rituals other than Islam. ”  Asked whether Christians should be allowed to enjoy alcoholic drinks in the privacy of their homes during the holiday, Almeqdesi replied in the negative, “as the alcohol was bought somewhere, whereas selling it and consuming it is forbidden, so you can’t drink it. Whoever’s caught breaking this law will be whipped and jailed. ”  Almeqdesi said the recent terror attacks in Jordan, Turkey and Germany “are part of the price these states must pay for positioning themselves as part of the Crusader Coalition of the infidel countries fighting against Islam. ”  Almeqdesi added that the Islamic State’s claiming responsibility for the recent terrorist attacks in Jordan and Berlin “was only to be expected seeing as the organization’s leadership pledged to punish all the states that form the coalition against it. While the attacks on Islamic states are ongoing, so will be the (terror) activity of our mujahideen brothers. ”     ",0

21713,Investment Strategist Forecasts Collapse Timeline: ‘The Last Gasp Of This Economic Cycle Will Come In 2018’,"(Image courtesy ddees.com ) 
It is no longer a question of whether or not financial markets and the U.S. economy will collapse. That, according to a host of experts, both mainstream and alternative, is a given.
The only question now is “when” that moment will come.
According to Christine Hughes, chief investment strategist at Otterwood Capital , it will be very soon. Basing her assessment on historically dead-on yield curve analysis, Hughes says in her latest update to clients that we’re looking at a maximum breaking point of 2020, but that some time in the next 12 – 15 months is the more likely scenario, which pegs the next crisis right at the beginning of 2018 .
First, the chart, which has been near perfect in its accuracy thus far and shows just how rapidly the yield curve has collapsed in the last 12 months:

Hughes explains what it means for you and why you can expect 2018 to be the year of reckoning:
As the bond market sees a recession slower growth means lower interest rates and it [the yield curve] collapses. So let’s assume we’re like every other time in history and that happens. Then it moves forward to 2018… 
So, 2018, according to the yield curve, is pretty much the last gasp we have for this economic cycle. We’re closing in on 2016 now… we basically have a year… maybe a year to 15 months before we have the next crisis on our hands. 
So if you are levered personally or corporately… if a lot of your assets are in illiquid stuff… the Canadian housing market comes to mind… You might want to think about existing and liquefying yourself. 
Watch the video report:

Wolf Richter of Wolf Street explains why the Treasury Yield Curve is so important:
Since early July, the 30-year US Treasury Bond Price Index has plunged 8.3%. It’s now called “the rout” in longer-dated government bonds. One of the specters is rising inflation at a time of ultra-low yields.
What has become the number one predictor of a bear market in stocks over the past many decades? The US Treasury yield curve. It drives bank lending – which can strangle the economy. But this time, the risks are much higher, and the potential economic consequences steeper. 
We know it is only a matter of time at this point.
Greg Mannarino of Traders Choice has made similar warnings, noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead. And when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts, according to Mannarino, could lead to extremely serious consequences:
So, when the debt bubble bursts we’re going to get a correction in population. It’s a mathematical certainty.
Millions upon millions of people are going to die on a world-wide scale when the debt bubble bursts. And I’m saying when not if… 
…
When resources become more and more scarce we’re going to see countries at war with each other. People will be scrambling… in a worst case scenario… doing everything that they can to survive… to provide for their family and for themselves. 
There’s no way out of it. 
Source: Analyst: “Millions Upon Millions of People Are Going to Die on a World-Wide Scale When the Debt Bubble Bursts” 
If Mannarino and Hughes are right, you have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapse .

21714,What’s that strange lump embedded in Hillary Clinton’s face?,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn 
Hillary Clinton is like a chameleon . 
Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams , who’s a trained hypnotist and observer of facial nuances, calls it an “unusual level of variability” in her physical appearance. In his words, Hillary “looks like an entirely different person every few days. See “ Chameleon Hillary Clinton is back to looking like sh*t — and the return of her medical handler ” and “ Hillary Clinton’s teeth, tongue-hole & now-you-see-it-now-you-don’t wrinkles ” 
On Monday, October 24, 2016, Hillary Clinton was in St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire for a rally , accompanied by “Fauxcahontas” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). 
Close-up images of her face show that she’s morphed again, back to yellow teeth and a face crisscrossed with wrinkles. What happened to the porcelain-doll Hillary with dazzling-white teeth of the July 2016 Democratic National Convention? 
But this time, at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, there’s something even stranger. 
Tuesday, Matt Drudge tweeted two close-up images of Hillary at the NH rally, which show something embedded under the skin of her right cheek . Here’s the tweet: 
Here are the two images again, enlarged. I painted yellow arrows pointing to the lumps: 
According to plastic surgeons , Botox injections don’t cause lumps under the skin. Dr. Richard Baxter explains that “Botox relaxes muscles that are hyperactive and so wrinkles caused by those muscles are smoothed,” but don’t lead to lumps. Dr. Janet Turkle says that although “Botox injections can result in temporary bumps due to the injection,” the bumps last “only a few minutes”. 
According to the American Academy of Facial Esthetics , however, “some of the risks of facial injections are lumps (granulomas/nodules) which are a potential risks [sic] associated with Radiesse, Sculptra, Juvederm, and ArteColl.” 
Facial injections are injections of facial fillers such as collagen, hyaluronic acid and calcium hydroxyl apatite that rejuvenate facial skin by reducing or eliminating wrinkles, raising scar depressions, enhancing lips and replacing soft-tissue volume loss.

GAME N GUIDE 
Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX recently held a Reddit Ask Me Anything session at 6:00 p.m. ET on Oct. 23. The session was said to be a follow-up to the executive’s speech in Mexico last month. Musk unveiled his plans for a refueling site and eventually habitation in the methane-rich planet. SpaceX is said to have raised more questions lately than it has revealed. The inventor and conglomerate went to Twitter to announce the session, Engadget reported. For instance, the company’s plan on colonizing Mars is yet to be discussed as well as the reliability of its space rockets and how it can be improved. In addition, the company also previously revealed that it would be reusing their rockets but have kept mum on how. Previously, Musk had a speech at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico in September. In the said Congress, Musk revealed his plans of sending humans to Mars apparently costing a whooping $10 billion each. Moreover he stated that humans will be turned into a multi-planetary species within the span of 40 years to a century. Musk revealed his vision with massive reusable rockets launching into a parking orbit stating that the rockets may be refueled by propellant tankers. Additionally, Musk plans to launch a thousand spaceships with a hundred people each en masse for Mars. He further revealed that a refueling station would be placed on the red planet to harvest methane fuel so settlers may come back to Earth. Hence, the first rocket to be sent is the Dragon spacecraft to search for a site to plant the refueling station followed by a spaceship with equipment to build the refueling station, LA Times reported. Musk went on to describe his ideal vision for human habitation on Mars. Musk revealed that glass panels with carbon fiber frames would be brought to the red planet to build geodesic domes on the planet’s surface. Furthermore, several miner and tunneling droids would also be sent to Mars. The droids are expected to be used to build large quantities of pressurized space for industrial operations along with glass domes for green living.

DOHA (Qatar), November 16. /TASS/. Real steps should be taken to restore Russia’s anti-doping system, President of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) Alexander Zhukov said at a session of the General Assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) on Wednesday. 
“Our NOC shares the concern over the situation in the anti-doping system,” Zhukov said. “Let us take practical measures to change the situation for the better and restore the atmosphere of trust and openness.” 
Russia’s Investigative Committee has questioned over 50 persons in the anti-doping probe, Zhukov said. 
“Speaking about measures taken in Russia to fight doping, I would like to stress that our steps for restoring the anti-doping system in Russia are consistent and being implemented at all the levels with the full support of the Russian government,” Zhukov told the ANOC General Assembly. 
“Recently, a federal law was adopted to stipulate punishment for encouraging doping. All the people who were involved in doping scandals were disqualified and dismissed. During the investigation of criminal cases related to the breach of anti-doping rules, prosecutors questioned over 50 athletes, representatives of federations and employees of the Sports Ministry,” he said. 
“Already now, a whole number of employees have been dismissed from the Sports Ministry and those organizations that are controlled by it,” Zhukov said. 
Russia’s Olympic chief thanked the international sports community for the decision to admit the Russian national team to the 2016 Rio Olympics. 
“The Olympiad in Rio was a great success and we overcame all the obstacles and traversed a difficult road,” Zhukov said. 
“It was not easy for us, especially considering the situation with the possible ban on Russians. I want to express gratitude to the IOC, colleagues and international sports federations for the decision to allow our clean athletes to participate in the Rio Olympics,” Zhukov said.

This administration is running like a   machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved. ” Trump lashed out at Democrats, asserting that he had inherited a mess from former President Obama, and criticized them for trying to stall his presidency. “The only thing they can do is delay, because they screwed things up royally,” he said.",0
21726,The Yale Record Just Published The BEST Non-Endorsement Of A Candidate EVER!,"The Yale Record Just Published The BEST Non-Endorsement Of A Candidate EVER! By Marty Townsend on October 27, 2016 Subscribe 
The Yale Record , America’s Oldest College Humor Magazine, has NOT endorsed Hillary Clinton – in a most spectacular way. 
The Yale Record is based in the college town of New Haven, Connecticut and was founded by Edward Anthony Bradford , James Heartt VanBuren , Samuel J. Elder , E.H. Lemis , and Henry Ward Beecher Howard in 1872, publishing their first weekly issue on September 11, 1872. They gleefully point readers to their lengthy Wikipedia page to prove their validity, claim the invention of the word “hot dog,” and ponder whether the face of the New Yorker would look different if they hadn’t been doing what they’re doing. 
The Record adopted “Old Owl” as their mascot over a century ago, but the actual date of acquisition wasn’t recorded anywhere. The mascot , described as a connoisseur of Cutty Sark , is: “… a congenial, largely nocturnal, 360-degree-head-turning, cigar-smoking bird who tries to steer the staff towards a light-hearted appreciation of life and the finer things in it.” 
From Wikimedia Commons available under a CC Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. 
With such an illustrious past, how could anything they produce not be spectacular? Let’s see what Old Owl had to say. 
The non-endorsement begins with a simple explanation of why they aren’t endorsing any candidate: “In its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are ‘absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.'” 
And: “The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code.” 
With that explained, one would ordinarily assume they were done. But no, they had a bit more to say : “In particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton’s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country—a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. “The Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein.” 
So there it is… absolutely the best non-endorsement EVER.

21728,Nike Reveals the ‘Pro Hijab’ for Muslim Athletes - The New York Times,"Nike, a company whose brand is estimated to be worth $27 billion, understands the difference apparel can make to an athlete. And like any viable business, it knows the world is full of potential customers. And so in its latest market expansion, the brand has turned to the Middle East, where female athletes have begun to come into their own over the last few years. This week, Nike announced that it would release a Pro Hijab for female Muslim athletes in spring 2018. The hijab, which is expected to cost $35, is made of a lightweight, stretchy mesh polyester and will come in gray, black and obsidian. Throughout several stages of development, the product was tested by a group that included Zahra Lari, the first figure skater from the United Arab Emirates to compete internationally Manal Rostom, a runner and triathlete currently living in Dubai and Amna Al Haddad, an Olympic weight lifter from the United Arab Emirates. The move followed Nike’s release of an Arabic version of its Nike  Training Club app early last year and the beginning of a campaign featuring five female athletes from the Arab region with the tagline “What will they say about you?” last month. “There weren’t any hijabi athletes to look up to when I was growing up, and I had to be my own pioneer, and now girls today have women like Amna Al Haddad and Zahra Lari to look to as role models, which is so inspiring,” Ms. Rostom wrote over WhatsApp. “For young girls to see these women and to see this revolutionary shift will change the face of sport for Muslim Arab girls, whether they wear hijab or not. ” Female athletes in the Middle East are a young but growing group. In the 2012 Summer Games, Brunei, Qatar and Saudi Arabia became the last three countries competing at the Olympics to send women. That same year, Egypt’s contingent included 37 women, the highest number of female athletes representing the country since it entered the games in 1912. The presence of   athletes like the boxer Arifa Bseiso, the fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad (who became the first hijabi American to compete at the Olympics for the United States last year) and the triathlete Najla Al Jeraiwi has become increasingly common at international competitions. But it was only in 2014 that FIFA, the international soccer organization, lifted its ban on religious headgear. The basketball organization FIBA maintains its ban and has postponed a vote on the matter until May. Beyond bans, there is the issue of comfort. Female Muslim athletes have struggled with finding headgear that will not slow them down or distract them from arduous physical exercise. It was Ms. Haddad’s difficulty in acquiring a hijab that met her requirements for competition  —   namely, that it would not shift when she moved and that it would be more breathable  —   that inspired the Pro Hijab project. “The one obstacle that’s always there if you’re a hijabi is, what is she going to wear on her head?” Ms. Rostom wrote. She explained that she usually buys a special   hijab in Kuwait that is made with polyester and cotton. “Cotton is extremely uncomfortable, especially if you are training outdoors or if you are running long distances, and especially when we live in one the hottest countries in the world,” she said. There are companies that manufacture   hijab, like Capsters in the Netherlands and Friniggi in Botswana, but none of them have as global and as visible a reach as Nike. “For us, we come up with ideas, and ways to be comfortable in what we wear, but to have the No. 1 sport and fitness brand in the world facilitate this process for us?” Ms. Rostom wrote. “To provide something we can grab and wear in 10 seconds? It’s going to change everything. ”",0

21730,Great Pyramid Key Ride at Ancient Amusement Park,"Monday, 31 October 2016 What other rides were on offer? 
The Giza pyramid complex outside of Cairo, Egypt commands the respect and admiration of most people on the planet. The most imposing structure by far is the great pyramid, Khufu's king pyramid, 455 feet tall and 756 feet wide. 
Conventional wisdom has long understood that the purpose of the pyramid was to honor Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and house his tomb. 
Recently it was discovered that the complex did ultimately become a tomb, but this was not the original purpose of its construction. 
""Well, we really missed the mark on this one,"" said Dr. Alfred Jacob Beasly, British-Canadian archeologist. ""When we went digging in another corner of the compound, we found all the discarded mechanics."" 
Apparently the Great Pyramid was first built as the world's biggest water ride. The ride wrapped around the outside of the pyramid and the inside housed the water pumps. 
""Yeah, somehow the whole complex got converted into a tomb sometime later,"" admitted Beasly. ""All the boat pits we found make more sense now."" 
Scholars have now looked back at related hieroglyphics and see references to what loosely translates to ""Ride the Nile"" ride references. 
""I never really got what these images were about,"" said Susan Biswell, Swiss Egyptologist. 
She shared with us drawings showing people riding boats in a channel winding up around the pyramid that then splashed down a ""log chute"" run, straight down the side back to the base.

21732,'There are many instances’ of voter fraud: GOP VP candidate Pence,"Politics US Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence speaks at a rally on October 25, 2016 in Marietta, Ohio. (Photo by AFP) 
US Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence says the mainstream media is biased against Donald Trump, and there are “many instances” of voter fraud in the run up to the November 8 election. 
Republican presidential nominee Trump has recently intensified his criticism of the American electoral system. He calls the election process rigged, and says the media is colluding with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in order to win the White House. 
He has questioned the legitimacy of the US elections, saying that he believed the vote was already being ""rigged"" at many polling places. 
During his final presidential debate with Clinton last week, Trump declared that he might not accept the results of the November 8 presidential election if there is evidence it was rigged. 
In an interview with CBS News on Friday, Trump’s running mate, Pence, said, “Make no mistake about it, there are many instances in our lifetimes of voter fraud in individual polling places and in certain jurisdictions.” 
“Donald Trump and I are just calling on people to respectfully participate in the electoral process. We want a victory on Election Day, but we also want it to be a victory for American democracy,” he stated. Donald Trump speaks at an event on October 15, 2016 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

The governor of Indiana rejected claims of critics that Trump’s “rigging” rhetoric may encourage violence by his supporters if he loses the presidential election. 
“We certainly would denounce any calls for anything other people being vigorously involved in the electoral process,” he said. 
“I have to tell you, I really don’t see it. The people that rallying around our team, rallying around our cause, love this country, are passionate about this country and are anxious to see change,” the GOP vice presidential nominee stated. 
He went on to accuse the media of unfairly backing Clinton. 
“The level of negative coverage about my running mate in many quarters in the national media has just been overwhelming compared to any negative coverage or frankly the avalanche of scandals coming out of Hillary Clinton’s years as secretary of State,” Pence said.

According to a recent poll released, 41 percent of American voters are saying the 2016 election could be ""stolen"" from Trump due to widespread voter fraud. 
And 73 percent of Republican voters think the election could be stolen from the billionaire businessman, while 17 percent of Democrats agree with the prospect of rigging. 
American writer and political commentator Stephen Lendman told Press TV on October 17 Washington has been rigging elections for nearly 200 years in order to keep anti-establishment candidates away from the White House. Loading ...",0

[10/31/16] As the Islamic State, insurgents, and government forces battle in Syria, the population of Christians there continues to decline, from 1,250,000 in 2011 to less than 500,000 this year, according to ADF International , which advocates for religious freedom worldwide. 
In a sub-report submitted with the report Genocide Against Christians in the Middle East to Secretary of State John Kerry in March, the ADF International details the ongoing genocide of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East. 
It notes that “Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world” and that in at least 104 countries Christians are harassed and persecuted by governments and organizations. 
The harassment includes “physical assaults, arrests and detentions, the desecration of holy sites and discrimination against religious groups in employment, education or housing,” reads the report. 
Harassment of Christians “was the highest in the Middle East and North Africa (90% of countries),” reported ADF International. In Syria and Iraq, the persecution of Christians is carried out largely by radical Muslims, such as the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, said the ADF. Post navigation",0
21735,DELINGPOLE: Talking the Trump Revolution with Ted Malloch,"Donald Trump is going to win a second term in 2020: you read it here, first. [I, in turn, heard it straight from the lips of an administration insider  —   Dr Ted Malloch, the business economics professor and prospective US ambassador to the European Union, who advised Trump from the early stages of his presidential campaign, and whom I’ve interviewed for this week’s Delingpole podcast.  Malloch is an ardent conservative of impeccable pedigree. I asked him what message he had for all those NeverTrump conservative types who still maintain that Hillary would have made the better President. Malloch: Get over it and move on. It’s what we’ve got. And guess what? It’s not for four years  —   it’s gonna be for eight years. He has already instigated his   campaign and I think I’ll break to you what the motto’s going to be. Can you guess? Delingpole: Um  —   Make America Great Again Again? Malloch: Keep America Great. Which has a certain assumption built into it: that during the next four years we’re going to achieve a great deal. And that then we just have to maintain that kind of trajectory. So this argument about what kind of conservative Trump is  —   is he a purist?  —   first of all he’s not a political philosopher and doesn’t purport to be an intellectual  …    This is not your father’s Oldsmobile. This is not your father’s Republican party. This is Donald Trump’s Republican party and it’s going to be a party that is more pragmatic, that is less ideological, that is more oriented towards national identity, towards   international relations and towards a degree of populism. So I would say ‘Like it or leave it.’ Forthright, supremely   and articulate, Malloch talks a good game. He would, no question, be a very entertaining US ambassador to the EU. But his appointment is being aggressively resisted by the EU establishment, which hasn’t taken kindly to his subtle hint in a BBC interview that, like the Soviet Union, it’s an empire ripe for collapse. I asked him why he thinks the war against Trump and his supporters has become so vicious. Malloch, a keen student of political history  —   he’s currently Professor of Strategic Leadership and Governance at Henley Business School  in the   believes that we are in the throes of a revolution and that the losers (who until recently were the political establishment) just aren’t enjoying losing. The Brexit and Trump shocks of 2016, he believes, are the   to the global takeover by the   in 1968. Malloch: In leftist circles and in academia both in Europe and the United States, the question has often been ‘Where were you in May of 1968?’ And the question was, of course: ‘Were you in Paris on the barricades? Were you part of the left? Were you taking that revolution to the streets?’ So we can ask this question, in a few years: ‘Where were you in 2016 when Donald Trump was elected president?’ Now we didn’t have any barricades on the street  —   although there were protests. We used mostly election booths to bring about our democratic means. But I think there is a significant change  —   both a watershed in world history and a change in the direction of American politics, that people will be writing about, frankly, hundreds of years from now. I’ve jokingly said that there are four faces carved into the mountain in South Dakota called Mount Rushmore. And they might have to find some more rock if this all goes as planned. ” Yup, you’re going to enjoy this podcast. Listen to it here. Or, if you do iTunes, here.",0
21739,Video Shows Swerving Truck Moments Before Deadly Church Bus Crash,"A concerned citizen videotaped a swerving pickup truck in the moments before a horrific crash with a church bus that left 13 people dead. The driver allegedly admitted to texting as the cause of his reckless driving. Twelve seniors on the bus, including the church bus driver, died at the scene. The thirteenth victim succumbed to their injuries at the hospital.[  Jody Kuchler, 55, recorded the revealing video as he called police to report the hazardous driving of    Jack Dillon Young, the pickup truck’s driver. The San Antonio   released the video showing the white Dodge pickup truck repeatedly crossing the center line and right shoulder marker. Kuchler recorded for approximately 20 minutes while attempting to get police to respond, the Daily Mail reported. A total of fourteen members of the First Baptist Church of New Braunfels, Texas, traveled to the Garner State Park area in Uvalde County, west of San Antonio, Breitbart Texas reported. The church bus collided with a white pickup truck at about 12:30 p. m. on Wednesday. DPS Spokesman Sergeant Conrad Hein told the Associated Press two passengers in the bus and the driver of the pickup truck sustained injuries in the crash. An ambulance transported the survivors to a hospital where they underwent treatment for their injuries.  KSAT ABC12 in San Antonio obtained audio of Kuchler’s calls to police. “‘He’s going to hit somebody head on or he’s going to kill his own damn self. Somebody needs to get this guy off the road,” he told Real County sheriff’s office dispatchers. “He’s going like 80 miles an hour right now. ” The dispatcher told the caller they were unable to respond as the driver was still in Uvalde County, the Daily Mail reported.  Real County dispatchers contacted neighboring Uvalde County. The Uvalde County Sheriff’s Office dispatched officers to the scene but the crash occurred before they could arrive, CBSDFW reported. Kuchler told reporters he recorded up to the moment of the collision with the church bus. He said they driver, Young, told him, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I was texting. ” Kuchler said he responded, “Son, do you know what you just did?” to which Young responded, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. ” The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Occasionally, a bit of truth escapes… 

From Greg Hunter, USAWatchdog : 
Boston University Economics Professor Laurence Kotlikoff says, “ So, if you put everything on the books, we’re broke, and we’ve been printing money out the wazoo since 2007 to pay Congress’s bills. That’s the truth about quantitative easing. We need to have somebody who knows what’s going on in the big picture here and has a game plan to get rid of this fiscal gap, and do it without total chaos. If we leave things the way they are, people will view the country as leaderless fundamentally and printing money to pay its bills. 
Then, the expectation will occur, and that’s going to raise rates, and that’s going to drop bond prices, and that will sink the banks, and, yes, you can have another great recession like Bill Gross is referencing (bond super nova). I’ve been saying this for decades. The time for the last straw to drop on the camel’s back, and when it’s going to drop that camel is hard to say. If you look at the fundamentals, and the fundamentals look like that of an emerging country, we are the most indebted developed country relative to GDP of any country around. 
We are in worse shape, I believe, than Russia or Greece, and far worse shape than Italy . ” On Sale At SD Bullion… This Week Only…",0
