22706,David Daleiden: ‘I’m Looking Forward to Seeing Trump Administration Deliver on Promises Made’ - Breitbart,"In an interview with Breitbart News, the creator of the now famous Planned Parenthood videos says attending this year’s March for Life is like coming full circle. [“I am really looking forward to seeing the new administration deliver on the promises they made, that we’re going to defund Planned Parenthood and stop forcing taxpayers to subsidize the biggest abortion business in our country,” the journalist says.  Following more than a year of being targeted by Planned Parenthood for his undercover videos revealing their alleged practice of selling the body parts of babies aborted in their clinics for a profit, Daleiden says being at March for Life 2017 with a new,   administration in office “means a lot. ” “It’s cool coming full circle to see Vice President Pence speaking here  —   it’s historic for a sitting vice president to be speaking at the March for Life  —   and for this vice president in particular,” he explains. “None of us would be talking about defunding Planned Parenthood had it not been for Congressman Mike Pence 10 years ago raising this issue and talking about it when nobody else was at the time. ” “I’m personally looking forward to a new Department of Justice, hoping that Planned Parenthood is finally going to be held accountable to the law for their numerous barbaric crimes against women, children, and families,” he adds. “I’m looking forward to seeing a   Congress and a   administration working together on enacting the significant policy changes that the majority of Americans tell us they want when it comes to abortion policy and increased protections for our unborn brothers and sisters. ”",0
22707,A Book Too Dangerous To Read,"A Book Too Dangerous To Read A Book Too Dangerous To Read? 
by Jennifer Margulis   Library Journal , which librarians read to decide what books to buy for their collections, announced last week that libraries should not carry the new book, The Vaccine-Friendly Plan : Dr. Paul’s Safe and Effective Approach to Immunity and Health, From Pregnancy Through Your Child’s Teen Years , which I co-authored with Paul Thomas, M.D., a Dartmouth-trained pediatrician who has over 13,000 patients in his pediatric practice in Portland, Oregon. 
“The author’s style is gentle and motivating,” the reviewer writes, “and he clearly cares for parents and children. Despite this, many parents will have a hard time following some of his suggestions (e.g. no manufactured baby food, no formula, no circumcision, avoid acetaminophen), as he advises parents to come to “well child visits with a signed vaccine refusal form” and specifically warns against hepatitis, chicken pox, flu, polio, and HPV vaccines, among others.” 
The review goes on: 
“VERDICT While Thomas does recommend a number of vaccines, his medical wisdom is too removed from both the AAP and the CDC (Centers   Prevention) guidelines to warrant a recommendation.” 
Don’t make this book available to library patrons. 
Don’t read this book. 
Don’t even have a conversation about safety issues with childhood vaccines. 
Instead, let’s just ignore the fact that the current rates of autism are at least 1 in 68, according to the CDC (possibly as high as 1 in 45 , also according to CDC data), that there’s a growing body of very disturbing scientific evidence showing that acetaminophen (the main ingredient in Tylenol) is triggering autism , and that American children today are plagued with allergies, asthma, and other chronic diseases (like Type 1 juvenile diabetes and leaky gut syndrome) than ever before. 
But following Dr. Paul’s recommendations to feed a baby and small child a real food, whole foods diet, stop using Tylenol , and making judicious decisions about vaccination is too difficult? A neonatologist and an obstetrician from Panama excited to read Your Baby, Your Way and The Vaccine-Friendly Plan , even as the Library Journal warns librarians against buying The Vaccine-Friendly Plan . Photo by Jennifer Margulis. 
Follow one-size-fits-all medicine as defined by the CDC and the AAP and watch your children spend the rest of their lives battling vaccine injury and chronic disease. 
Follow Dr. Paul Thomas’ vaccine-friendly plan of avoiding toxins, eating real food, getting plenty of outdoor time and sunlight, and choosing to do judiciously spaced vaccines, one aluminum-containing shot at a time (or choosing no vaccines at all), and raise happy, healthy children. 
You decide.

22710,Report: DePaul University Banned ’Gay Lives Matter’ Poster for Gay Reporter’s Lecture on Radical Islam - Breitbart,"DePaul University reportedly banned “Gay Lives Matter” posters which were designed to advertise a lecture from a gay journalist on radical Islam which took place on campus Wednesday night.

We are not even using the poster to push an entire movement, but rather a specific event. We, as students in an academic setting, should be allowed to market our events as we see fit. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

22713,"Modi effect: Facebook to abolish fake troll accounts, users can transfer content till 31st Dec","Tweet (Image via intoday.in) 
Just as the Indian economy is facing the evil of black money , Facebook and Twitter have seen the menace of fake and anonymous accounts growing in the past few years. As per the latest data, Facebook has approximately 71 million active Indian users out of which 15 million are anonymous/fake while Twitter has 22 million active Indian users out of which 7 million are anonymous/fake, posing a big threat to the idea of troll-less (white) social media. 
Announcing this historic move, the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter issued a joint statement: “All anonymous / fake accounts with more than 500 friends / 1000 followers will be suspended at 12 midnight of 9th November. These friends/ followers along with content can be transferred to the original account till 31st December 2016.” 
Here are some of the highlights of the historic speech: 1. No content can be posted / tweeted / shared / re-tweeted from the anonymous/fake account after 12 am of 9th Nov. 2. The content of the anonymous account can be transferred by submitting an original DP/ original name. The last date for the same is 31st Dec. 3. In case of an emergency post (like trolling a politician / cricketer / film celebrity), user can login using his original login details and post for the next 72 hours. 4. All users with less than 100 followers will continue to exist and be spared from suspension. 5. A daily withdrawal cap of 2000 tweets/day has been put which will be later increased to 4000 tweets/day 
“Your content and followers will remain yours. No need to panic. You have 50 days to submit the proof,” assured Zuckerberg. 
The decision elicited mixed reviews: some predicted that social media will see a downfall in the coming few days while others welcomed the move considering its effects in the long run.",0
22716,My Appeal to Leftists Who Won't Vote or Who Believe Voting Third Party Is a Principled Stance,"By Chad Kautzer / filmsforaction.org 
My appeal to leftist comrades who think that not voting is a way to be a ""principled"" leftist, or that it's leftist to choose a third-party candidate so you can vote in good conscience. These are not leftist positions (Yes, I dare to assert a basic standard for distinguishing liberal and Leftist positions). 
It would be leftist to organize a boycott of the vote, so that abstention was a collective act with a clear and practical goal. It would also be leftist to vote for a third-party candidate if it furthered a leftist project. Currently, neither of these is the case, so we can take them off the table. 
Liberals are committed to an electoral system of politics and believe that politicians should ""represent"" their will. Indeed, many liberals want to completely identify with their candidates. This leads liberals to talk about voting their conscience or abstaining because they don't want to have to choose between the lessor of two evils. The liberal illusion is that it could ever be otherwise (next time we'll have candidates we can believe in!). 
Elections are always a choice between evils, but elections are only one component of leftist politics. We choose the candidates who will do the least amount of harm to our larger projects for radical change. And after voting, we get on with those projects - mobilizing at the grassroots, educating and organizing against oppression, capacitating our communities, and constantly challenging ourselves to be better friends and comrades. 
When we vote, we do not endorse liberalism and we are not morally compromised (as liberals would assert). We are using whatever resources are available to us to realize leftist goals and sometimes that means little more than choosing a politician who represents the least opposition to those goals. 
So, leftist comrades, I say this with love: let's shake off the liberal moralism of electoral politics and focus on what best enables the achievement of practical, leftist projects. This work is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License 4.3 ·",0

His studies in history and background in the media industry have given him a keen insight into the use of mass media as a creator of conflict in the modern world. His favored areas of study include state sponsored terrorism, media manufactured reality and the role of intelligence services in manipulation of populations and the perception of events. Iraqi Army Discovers US-Made Missiles in ISIS’s Military Base in Mosul By Ian Greenhalgh on November 2, 2016 Iraqi Army Discovers US-Made Missiles in ISIS’s Military Base in Mosul Iraqi Army Discovers US-Made Missiles in ISIS’s Military Base in Mosul 
Iraqi army and popular forces have discovered a number of US-made missiles from a military position of the ISIS (ISIL, IS, Daesh) in the Southern part of Mosul, informed local sources disclosed after the first group of pro-government troops opened their way into Southern Mosul on Monday. 
“Several US-made missiles were found in al-Shoura region to the South of Mosul,” a local source said on Monday. 
The Iraqi army and popular forces had found US-made missiles in Anbar province several times before. 
Provincial officials confirmed that the US-made weapons were sent by the US-led anti-ISIL coalition airplane for the ISIL terrorists in Anbar province. 
Meantime, Iraqi security officials announced that the ISIL has sent US-made military equipment to Tal Afar region in the last two days to stand strong against Iraqi popular forces’ impending attack to capture the region. 
“The ISIL terrorists have sent US-made TOW anti-tank missiles to Tal Afar and it is quite evident that they are preparing for a long-term war,” the Arabic-language media quoted an Iraqi security official as saying on Monday. 
In late August 2015, a senior Iraqi intelligence official revealed that the US helicopters drop weapons and other aids for the ISIL terrorists in the Western province of al-Anbar. 
“The fighters present at the forefront of fighting against the ISIL always see US helicopters flying over the ISIL-controlled areas and dropping weapons and urgent aids for them,” the official who called for anonymity told FNA. Yet, he said the helicopters could have also been sent from Turkey or Israel. 
He added that in addition to dropping aids, the helicopters transfer the ISIL ringleaders and wounded members from the battleground to some hospitals in Syria or other countries which support the terrorist group. 
The official cautioned that such assistance further prolongs the conflicts in Anbar, adding that when the Iraqi army and popular forces purge the terrorists from Anbar province, the US helicopters will transfer the ISIL ringleaders to other regions to prevent the Iraqi forces’ access to ISIL secrets. 
Also in March 2015, a group of Iraqi popular forces known as Al-Hashad Al-Shabi shot down the US Army helicopter that was carrying weapons for the ISIL in the Western parts of Al-Baghdadi region in Al-Anbar province. 
Meantime in February 2015, a senior lawmaker disclosed that Iraq’s army had shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province. 
“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” al-Zameli said. Related Posts:",0

Do you think that, when we look at nine of our first twelve presidents as slave owners, should we start taking their statues down and say, we’re embarrassed by you?” RICE: I’m a firm believer keep your history before you. So I don’t actually want to rename things that were named for slave owners. I want us to look at the names and recognize what they did and be able to tell our kids what they did and for them to have a sense of their own history. When you start wiping out history, sanitizing history to make you feel better, it’s a bad thing. But let me say one thing about our constitution, that constitution originally counted my answers as   of a man. In 1952 my father had trouble registering to vote in Birmingham, Alabama. In 2005, I stood in the Ben Franklin room, one of our founders, I took an oath of office to the same constitution, and it was administered by Jewish woman Supreme Court justice. That is the story of America. The long road to freedom has indeed been long. It has sometimes been violent. It had many martyrs but ultimately has been Americans claiming those institutions for themselves and expanding the definition of ‘We the People.’ KILMEADE: Does it make you think less, should we think less of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson because they were slave owners? RICE: They were people of their times. I wish they had been like John Adams who did not believe in slavery. I wish they had been like Alexander Hamilton, who was an immigrant, by the way, a child of questionable parentage from the Caribbean. I wish all of them had been like that. Jefferson in particular, a lot of contradictions in Jefferson. They were people from their time. We should celebrate the from the Jeffersons, Washingtons, slave owners, look where we are now.

22730,Billionaire Ray Dalio Says Populism More Powerful Than Monetary Policy,"The founder of the world’s largest hedge fund says that populism is likely to to play a bigger role in the economy than monetary or fiscal policies over the next year. [Ray Dalio, who runs the $150 billion dollar hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, published a lengthy paper  on Wednesday that analyzes the role of populism in today’s world and in history. Populism is now at its highest level since the 1930s, according to the paper, “Populism: The Phenomenon. ”  “We believe that populism’s role in shaping economic conditions will probably be more powerful than classic monetary and fiscal policies (as well as a big influence on fiscal policies),” Dalio and three Bridgewater colleagues write.  Bridgewater is the world’s largest hedge fund. The paper introduces a “Developed World Populism Index,” which Dalio says measures the strength of populism over time. It’s a weighted index of the vote share of   parties or candidates in national elections for major developed countries since 1900. The index shows that populism is now at its highest level since the early 1930s. Contemporary populism includes supporters of Donald Trump, UKIP in the UK, AfD in Germany, National Front in France, Podemos in Spain and Five Star Movement in Italy. The bulk of the study focuses on the history of populism, focussing on 14 leaders from the past in 10 different countries. Current populists aren’t examined in detail because “the stories of the ones in power or possibly coming to power are still being written,” Dalio writes. “Populism is a political and social phenomenon that arises from the common man, typically not   being fed up with 1) wealth and opportunity gaps, 2) perceived cultural threats from those with different values in the country and from outsiders, the “establishment elites” in positions of power, and 4) government not working effectively for them,” according to Dalio. “In other words, populism is a rebellion of the common man against the elites and, to some extend, against the system. ” Dalio has changed his view on Trump a few times. In the weeks after the election, Dalio said his view of Trump was “broadly positive. ” Speaking in Davos, Switzerland in January, he said that he believed there was “an optimistic possibility” that Trump’s policies would stimulate the U. S. economy. More recently, however, he has been fretting over possible downsides of Trump’s populism. And now? “We have more questions than answers about him and are using these other cases to assess him against by seeing if he follows a more archetypical path [of populists past] or if he deviates from it significantly,” Dalio writes.",0

Andrew Sullivan is a well known libertarian thinker. He is an author, a blogger and an outspoken conservative commentator. 
Sullivan used to cover the Clinton White House for the New Republic. From the earliest days, he had negative feelings about the Clintons. In describing the Clintons, he said: “They are very much the establishment. They are very much after money. They are very much after power.” Sullivan was born and raised in England, but attended and graduated from Harvard University, where he earned both Masters and Doctoral degrees in government. The writer ties his conservative beliefs to his Roman Catholic upbringing in a family or Irish descent. Andrew Sullivan has long been outspoken about his dislike for Hillary Clinton. During an appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher, he referred to the former Secretary of State as a “talentless hack.” He bashed her “disastrous” time as Secretary, citing the situations in Libya and Iraq as evidence of her lack of judgement. Maher accused Sullivan of hating Hillary, and he didn’t disagree. So it has come as a big surprise to many that Sullivan is now publicly and prominently saying, “I’m with her.” The sharp tongued Clinton critic is now planning to vote for her and he is clear about why. He told Brian Williams of MSNBC : “There is almost no scenario I could imagine in which I might actually support Hillary Clinton for president except this. Because I honestly believe that Donald J. Trump is not just a normal candidate in this election; that he is a threat to our entire democratic system, that his appearance to the top of the national ticket is probably the gravest crisis in this country’s modern history. And I think defeating him is not just something that we should take as a Democrat or Republican or even as a sort of a way of expressing ourselves. It is a way to say for the moment the very core principles of liberal democracy that he is attacking on a daily almost hourly basis.” When one of our most outspoken conservative decides that he has to vote for the Democrat out of love for the country, things are looking grim for the GOP. Donald Trump is in deep trouble when someone like Andrew Sullivan calls him the “gravest crisis” in our recent history. Oh, and one more thing. This will be the very first vote that Andrew Sullivan will be casting as a new American citizen. I hope all of his conservative fans follow in his footsteps.

22734,"NYC Mayor threatens to destroy IDNYC database containing personal info of nearly 500,000 illegal immigrants","November 11, 2016 Mayor Bill de Blasio shills for Soros; positions to block Trump Admin from acquiring database 
NEW YORK CITY ( INTELLIHUB ) — The city’s Mayor Bill de Blasio told the press on Thursday Thursday that he may have to destroy records kept by the city which contain limited personal information on nearly 500,000 illegal immigrants residing within the city. 
The 2015 IDNYC program, aimed at documenting illegal residents, provides illegal aliens with a means to maneuver within the city and function as a typical American citizen as part of a vast scheme concocted by billionaire tycoon and Black Lives Matter promoter George Soros , which ultimately makes NYC a ‘sanctuary city.’ 
“We’re not going to tear families apart. So we will do everything we know how to do to resist that,” de Blasio said, promoting illegal immigration. 
“We’re not going to take anything lying down.” 
IDNYC cardholders personal information is stored in encrypted databases on secure servers and may be of interest to the Trump Administration, de Blasio fears. 
The mayor plans to block the Trump Administration from subpoenaing the databases in question, if that issue were ever to arise at a future time. Featured Image: Bill de Blasio/Flickr ©2016. INTELLIHUB.COM. All Rights Reserved.",0

22740,Austrian Populist Leader: Put Islamists on Prison Islands,"The leader of the populist   migration Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ)   Strache has proposed that known Islamists should be arrested and sent to prisons on “lonely islands”. [Mr. Strache made the comments in reaction to the terrorist attack in Manchester which saw the deaths of 22 people and over 60 injured. The FPÖ leader said Islamists were “tomorrow’s murderers” and the European Union needed to introduce “hard” measures against returning Islamic State fighters, Austrian newspaper Die Presse reports.  According to Strache, almost all of the Islamic State fighters who return to Europe from Syria and Iraq pose a potential security risk. He said many of these fighters, including the Manchester terrorist, are well known to authorities. “If they are banished to a lonely and   island, the problem is solved for the most part, instead of waiting until they strike and massacre people,” he said. He also urged EU member states to deport foreign radicals as soon as possible. “Against such radical people, only hard measures help,” he noted. Strache has long been an ardent critic of both radical Islamic terrorism, mass migration, and Islamisation in Austria. Taking over the leadership of the FPÖ in 2005, he has managed to transform the party from a fringe group to a major force in Austrian politics. Earlier this year Strache expressed a desire to completely ban Islamism in Austria. He called the ideology “antagonistic to women, antiliberal and corresponds to a fascist worldview” and added that any migrants from the Islamic world “may go back to their Islamic country, we have forced no one to come here”. On the subject of mass migration, Strache is clear that he thinks German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the “most dangerous woman in Europe” because of her   policies which led to over a million migrants entering Germany in 2015. After the surprise resignation of former Austrian   Reinhard Mitterlehner, the coalition government of the conservative Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) and the Socialists has largely collapsed and early elections announced for October 15th. Whilst the ÖVP has seen a boost in polls due to the new leadership of popular Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, the FPÖ have remained in the contention. Some have predicted a possible coalition government between the conservatives and the FPÖ as Mr. Kurz has been the main proponent for the recent banning of the Islamic full face veil and has agreed with other proposals like housing incoming asylum seekers on islands until they can be properly processed.

22742,Trump Donates First-Quarter Salary to National Park Service - The New York Times,"President Trump, who promised to work for free, donated his salary for the first quarter of the year on Monday to the National Park Service, which, like other government agencies, faces major cuts in the president’s first budget proposal. At the daily White House briefing, Sean Spicer, the president’s press secretary, presented a check signed by Mr. Trump for $78, 333. 32 to Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, who oversees the park service. “I’m thrilled,” Mr. Zinke said. Presidents are paid $400, 000 a year, not counting benefits that come with the job, including housing in a fairly spacious residence. But Mr. Trump, perhaps the wealthiest person ever to hold the presidency, made a point during the campaign of saying he did not need taxpayers to compensate him. His daughter Ivanka Trump and    Jared Kushner, who together are worth as much as $740 million, are working on his staff without taking salaries. The White House had previously said that Mr. Trump would donate his salary to charity at the end of the year and suggested he would even allow reporters to decide the beneficiary. “He kindly asked that you all help determine where that goes,” Mr. Spicer said last month. “The way that we can avoid scrutiny is let the press corps determine where it should go. ” Mr. Spicer did not explain on Monday why the plan had changed, but said the White House Counsel’s Office presented a series of alternatives to the president and he chose the National Park Service. “The park service has cared for our parks since 1916, and the president is personally proud to contribute the first quarter of his salary to the important mission of the park service, which is preserving our country’s national security,” Mr. Spicer said. But in picking a government agency, Mr. Trump chose one with a large backlog of deferred maintenance that could be deferred even longer under his budget. Mr. Trump proposed a cut of $1. 5 billion, or 12 percent, from the Interior Department, which oversees the park service and other agencies. The proposal did not specify how much of that would come out of the park service budget. He also chose an agency with which he has had a fraught relationship. Mr. Trump was angry when a park service employee using an agency Twitter account reposted information comparing the size of his Inauguration Day crowd unfavorably with that of former President Barack Obama in 2009. Mr. Trump was livid and called the acting director of the park service the day after his inauguration to complain about the post and to ask for further photographic evidence about the size of his crowd. Mr. Trump made his   pledge a regular talking point on the campaign trail, pointing to his personal wealth as a way of demonstrating his independence. “I won’t take even one dollar,” Mr. Trump declared in 2015. “I am totally giving up my salary if I become president. ” The trick, according to the Constitution, was that he could not refuse his pay. So he opted to donate the salary instead, much as John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover did.",0

John Dickson, the executive VP and COO of Coastal Community Bank, said the suspects did not escape with any money and that the bank experienced another   by masked thieves trying to access the cash deposit box a few weeks ago. “They attempted to get into the ATM and it looks like they used a blowtorch, which caught the currency on fire and created a little fire damage,” said Dickson. Police identified two suspects from surveillance footage of the incident that shows one of the men trying to urinate on the fire to put it out. The suspects in question are Eli Steen and Jason Kovar, both 31, of Everett, police say. Police say they could arrest Steen and Kovar on charges of burglary and arson because they have “probable cause” and are also looking to question them to see if they are connected to other commercial burglaries that took place in Snohomish County.

22745,Duterte Calls US Admin ‘Monkeys’ for Halting Arms Sales,"Duterte Calls US Admin ‘Monkeys’ for Halting Arms Sales November 02, 2016 Duterte Calls US Admin 'Monkeys' for Halting Arms Sales 
(MANILA) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte chided the United States on Wednesday for halting the planned sale of 26,000 rifles to his country, calling those behind the decision ""fools"" and ""monkeys"" and indicating he might turn to Russia and China instead. Duterte's tirades against the former colonial power are routine during his speeches and he said on Wednesday he once believed in Washington, but had since lost respect for what is the Philippines' biggest ally. The U.S. State Department halted the sale of the assault rifles to the Philippine police after U.S. Senator Ben Cardin said he would oppose it, Senate aides told Reuters on Monday. Aides said Cardin, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was reluctant for the United States to provide the weapons given concern about human rights violations in the Philippines during Duterte's bloody, four-month-old war on drugs. 
""Look at these monkeys, the 26,000 firearms we wanted to buy, they don't want to sell,"" Dutertesaid during a televised speech. 
""Son of a b***h, we have many home-made guns here. These American fools."" 
More than 2,300 people have been killed in police operations or by suspected vigilantes as part of Duterte's anti-narcotics campaign, which was the lynchpin of his election campaign. 
Duterte has vented his anger at the United States for raising concerns about the extra-judicial killings. 
""That's why I was rude at them, because they were rude at me,"" he said. 
According to procedures in Washington, the State Department informs Congress when international weapons sales are in the works. Aides said the State Department had been informed Cardin would oppose the deal during the prenotification process, thus halting the sale. 
U.S. State Department officials did not comment. 
The Philippine police chief, Ronald dela Rosa, on Tuesday expressed disappointment that police would not get the M4 rifles, which he said were reliable. 
Duterte reiterated that Russia and China had shown willingness to sell arms to the Philippines, but he would wait to see if his military wanted to continue using U.S. weapons. 
""Russia, they are inviting us. China also. China is open, anything you want, they sent me brochure saying we select there, we'll give you. 
""But I am holding off because I was asking the military if they have any problem. Because if you have, if you want to stick to America, fine. 
""But, look closely and balance the situation, they are rude to us."" Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?

22746,‘US undermining Daesh fight to get footing in Syria’,"‘US undermining Daesh fight to get footing in Syria’ ‘US undermining Daesh fight to get footing in Syria’ By 0 166 
The Pentagon’s plan to launch an offensive against the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group in Syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the Syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group, says James Petras, an American political commentator. 
US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told NBC News on Wednesday that the Pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust Daesh from the Syrian city of Raqqah, the terror group’s stronghold in the country. 
Carter, who was in Iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh, said the Raqqah offensive would begin when Iraq’s second largest city is cleared. 
He claimed that US forces won’t be directly involved in any of the operations. 
“This is a ploy to have the US in northern Syria,” Petras said, arguing that the US was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat Daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflict-ridden country.

22748,The Eagles Sue Mexican ’Hotel California’ That Opened Decades Before Release of Famous Song - Breitbart,"There’s not plenty of room at the Hotel California. But The Eagles sued the Mexican hotel, anyhow. [The rock band filed suit in federal court against the   hotel in Baja, Mexico, this week for using their most famous song’s title without their permission. The litigation faces one major hurdle: the real Hotel California opened more than a quarter century before the imaginary one immortalized in song.  “Defendants lead U. S. consumers to believe that the Todos Santos Hotel is associated with the Eagles and, among other things, served as the inspiration for the lyrics in ‘Hotel California,’ which is false,” the lawsuit alleges. While one can argue that the hotel did not inspire the song, one cannot argue that the song inspired the hotel. Its founder broke ground on the project in 1947, the birth year of Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmidt, Joe Walsh, Bernie Leadon, and Don Felder. It opened three years later. While the property called itself Hotel California at its origin, as dated pictures attest, its founder, a Chinese immigrant named Mr. Wong, attempted to assimilate by changing his name to Don Antonio Tabasco, which did not fool the locals, who collectively changed his name to “El Chino” —  the Chinese man. The hotel’s website further informs, contrary to the claims of the lawsuit, that though “the present owners of the hotel do not have any affiliation with the Eagles, nor do they promote any association, many visitors are mesmerized by the ‘coincidences’ between the lyrics of the hit song and the physicality of the hotel and its surroundings. ” These coincidences include guests arriving by traveling a “desert highway,” hearing mission bells chime daily, and smelling “colitas” occasionally in the air. Alas, no mirrors adorn the ceilings and you can leave whenever you want. The Eagles famously provoked condemnation when they broke the $100 barrier for tickets at their reunion concerts in 1994. With the death of Glenn Frey earlier this year, the opportunities for massive moneymaking opportunities appear diminished. But litigation lottery generally pays well for the winners.

22749,Obama To Apply For Political Asylum In Moneygall,"0 Add Comment 
AS THE countdown to the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States draws ever nearer, political opponents of president-elect Trump are said to fear for their freedom during his reign after previous statements hinted at the fact the billionaire would stamp out dissenting voices. 
The rumours that President Obama is applying for political asylum in Moneygall emerged recently and have resulted in an excited Irish government issuing the US president with 400 passports ‘just in case he loses one of them’. 
“I think after the inauguration, I’ll just go home, relax and be with my people,” Obama had stated as recently as yesterday, sparking a widespread acceptance in the Offaly town of Moneygall that this utterance was a code word for ‘I will be seeking political asylum in Moneygall’. 
All expert testimony suggesting that Obama simply meant he would be returning to Chicago was rejected out of hand by Moneygall natives. 
“I know a cry for help from my 32nd cousin twice removed when I hear it! You wouldn’t understand, it’s just a feeling almost blood relatives share with one another,” Maire Obama, real name Maire O’Neill, shared with WWN. 
After learning that he would likely spend upwards of 10 years in a Direct Provision Centre before finding out if his application for asylum in Moneygall could be granted, it is believed Obama stated ‘still sounds better than 4 years under that orange prick’.",0
22751,Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe Stands with Planned Parenthood,"Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe says a bill that would have prohibited his state from entering into contracts with Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers “would harm tens of thousands of Virginians,” reports ABC7. [As expected, McAuliffe vetoed a bill that would have allowed Virginia to redirect Medicaid funding from abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood to other federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) that are more numerous and provide more comprehensive care.  During a veto event outside the executive mansion Tuesday, McAuliffe said the mansion was the “brick wall” protecting women’s health care, says a report at Richmond  . “It’s important for women to have access to quality health care,” the governor said. “This is what matters to Virginia families today. ” ”We are here today because I’m going to veto senate bill 2264.”  —  @TerryMcAuliffe #IStandWithPP pic. twitter.   —     (@PPMW_ACT) February 21, 2017,  In his remarks, McAuliffe also likened North Carolina’s bathroom privacy law to the bill he vetoed as another example of discrimination that could harm Virginia’s business interests. “Discrimination breeds hatred and we will not tolerate that in the commonwealth of Virginia,” he said. “We treat everyone equally, with dignity and respect. ” Planned Parenthood tweeted its celebration of McAuliffe’s veto of the bill: It’s a great day to have @GovernorVA as a Planned Parenthood supporter. #HB2264 has been vetoed! pic. twitter.   —   PPAVirginia (@PPAVirginia) February 21, 2017,  The legislation was sponsored by Del. Benjamin L. Cline (R) and passed the state Senate last week on a   vote. “This important legislation would have prioritized taxpayer dollars toward providers of more comprehensive health care services, and the governor’s veto undermines those efforts to improve health care in rural and underserved areas,” Cline said in a statement. Democrat leaders, however, defended Planned Parenthood. “Attacks on Planned Parenthood do nothing to advance health care,” said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D). “They take us in the wrong direction. ” Lt. Gov. Ralph S.  Northam (D) who is making a bid for governor, took the “war on women” approach by saying lawmakers, “most of whom are men,” should let women decide what to do with their bodies. Nevertheless, Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, said in vetoing the bill, McAuliffe placed “the abortion lobby” before “the women and unborn children of the commonwealth. ” A similar bill prohibiting Medicaid funds to any abortion provider passed the Virginia state legislature last year. In a strong show of support for Planned Parenthood, McAuliffe went to the abortion business’s facility in Richmond itself to veto the legislation. The Virginia Bureau of Watchdog. org reported that Planned Parenthood contributed more than $1. 7 million to McAuliffe’s gubernatorial campaign in 2013. Abortion industry lobbying organization NARAL donated $56, 000 to his campaign, as well. Federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) provide many more services to   families than Planned Parenthood does. Nationally, there are 13, 000 FQHCs  —   a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities 20 to 1. Despite the overwhelming number of FQHCs, however, Democrats who are often supported by the abortion lobby claim that by redirecting funding away from Planned Parenthood, states are preventing   individuals from accessing health care.",0

22753,Hillary Clinton Holds 6-Point Lead Despite FBI Probe [Update],"Despite the e-mail FBI probes currently ongoing, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton holds a 6-point lead over her rival Donald Trump. On October 31, 2016, at approximately 4:00 P.m. EDT, NBC announced, “James Comey, FBI Director, released a statement about the Democratic nominee having several emails on a nonsecure server.”
The timing of the FBI probe, while Clinton holds a 6-point lead over Trump, remains coincidental. According to NBC: “A recent poll tracking the election asked voters whether or not the release of Comey’s letter was a publicity stunt to distract them or an attempt to address an actual problem. Due to the timing of the letter’s release, about 56 percent of voters believe the letter was to deter voters from voting for the Democratic nominee and remains unaffected.”
Voters have spoken out about the need for the FBI to probe Clinton, as she poses a threat to Trump as she holds a national 6-point lead.
Update: CNN Politics 
A Poll conducted by CNN Politics shows that Clinton has a 5-point lead over North Carolina; a state Trump needs to win.

22760,German Media Promotes Migrants Replacing Ageing Locals in Small European Towns,"German magazine Der Spiegel has begun a series of articles entitled “The New Arrivals” claiming in one piece that mass migration can revive declining birth rates in small Spanish towns. [The German publication told the story of a Moroccan migrant from Tangier named Said al Ghoury who moved with his family to the small Spanish town of Visiedo with his family and claims he “rescued” the village from demographic decline.  Since 1998 the number of immigrants flowing into Spain has increased ten times and in the last year alone the figure increased by 12. 2 percent. In real numbers around 4. 6 million people, many from North Africa, have flooded into Spain. The small village of Visiedo is located in the province of Teruel which has experienced a decline in its Spanish population from 136, 000 in 1998 to 123, 000 today and around 14, 000 migrants have moved to the area. Rosario Sampedro, a migration sociologist at the University of Valladolid said in some rural regions of the country the, “population was rejuvenated,” by mass migration but added, “the situation is still tense in the remote areas. ” In Teruel, the population is already ageing with   of the population being over the age of 60. Vicente Gonzalvo of the “New Ways” program actively promotes the idea of sending migrants to these small villages where they would replace the ageing native Spanish. “We want to revive the dying villages,” he said adding, “The native Spaniards in the countryside must realise that they too will benefit when their communities gain new inhabitants. ” Hassan Bellahmama is another Moroccan who moved to a small town in Spain, choosing to become a shepherd in the town of Alfambra. “There are only a few Spaniards who want to do this job. Most cattle farmers in the province employ foreigners,” said Pedro José Escusa who employs Bellahmama. In Germany, experts have said that sending migrants into rural communities would not just help the dwindling populations, but would also act as an “integration laboratory” as well. Wolfgang Borst, major of the Bavarian village of Hofheim sees mass migration as an “opportunity” saying, “We are very satisfied. We are gaining a lot more villagers. ” Others like Klaus Poelitz say the main problem is the “prejudice” of the locals in rural communities. The migrant crisis hasn’t been all positive for many small towns as some have been driven into enormous amounts of debt to provide food and shelter for migrants. Some residents have reacted strongly against proposals to house large amounts of migrants in their communities. When Joachim Kebschull, the    mayor of Oersdorf planned to welcome migrants into the town of only 900 several locals beat him unconscious before a meeting of the town’s urban planning committee. In France,   migration mayor of Béziers Robert Ménard was fined 1, 800 euros for mentioning the changing demographics of his town. Ménard mentioned the theory of the “great replacement” coined by prolific French author Renaud Camus who said that mass migration will lead to the cultural and demographic transformation of European societies.",0

22764,Three Charged with Supplying Arms to Charlie Hebdo Attackers,"PARIS (AFP)  —   Three people have been charged with supplying arms to jihadists who staged deadly attacks in 2015 on a Jewish supermarket in Paris and the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly, a judicial source said. [Those charged this week include Samir L. believed to be linked to the sale of weapons to the supermarket attacker, as well as Miguel M. and Abdelaziz A. who are thought to have been involved in trafficking arms between Belgium and France.  Seven people have already been charged over the assaults. The attackers had a wide array of weapons including guns that came from Slovakia. Investigators are trying to piece together how   jihadist Amedy Coulibaly obtained the weapons used in the January 9, 2015 attack on the supermarket. Coulibaly killed four people after taking shoppers hostage at the Jewish store. Elite police later shot him dead as they stormed the building. He had killed a policewoman in the Montrouge suburb south of Paris the night before, when authorities think he may have initially been targeting a nearby Jewish school. The attack was part of three days of terror in the French capital that began with the raid on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine offices that killed 12 people.",0

22779,PUTIN JUST ISSUED INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANT FOR GEORGE SOROS … DEAD OR ALIVE,"Comments 
Back in the 1990’s George Soros helped to nearly destroy the Russian economy. So, last year, this grand billionaire was banned from Russia. But, that’s not all. George Soros is now a wanted man in Russia and his organizations are considered as a “threat to Russian national security”. 
From Political Reviewer: 
Matt Taibbi of the Rolling Stone said of Goldman Sachs six years ago: 
“The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it’s everywhere. The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. 
“In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who’s Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.” 
Obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs. Phil Butler puts it well when he says: “George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it.”

22781,2 Face Hate Crime Charges in Attack on Sikh Man in California - The New York Times,"Two men in California were charged with hate crimes on Friday in connection with an attack on a Sikh man, punching him in the face and using a knife to cut up to 10 inches of his hair, which was unshorn by religious mandate, a prosecutor said. The attack, which unfolded over the span of about three minutes and a   stretch of road in Richmond, Calif. on Sept. 25, started by chance, officials said. Five men who were doing subcontracting work at a refinery were staying at a local hotel and had been drinking beer most of the day when they went to get something to eat, Simon O’Connell, a deputy district attorney with the Contra Costa District Attorney’s Office, said in an interview on Friday. The men were in a pickup around 8:45 p. m. when they pulled up to a red traffic light next to a sedan driven by Maan S. Khalsa, 41, of Richmond. In what Mr. O’Connell said was an unprovoked act, the occupants threw beer cans at Mr. Khalsa’s car. When he rolled down his window and said, “You guys forgot something,” the men, angered by his remark, followed him to the next red light. Two of the men  —   identified as Chase B. Little, 31, of Beaumont, Tex. and Colton T. Leblanc, 24, of Winnie, Tex.  —   ran to Mr. Khalsa’s car and repeatedly punched him in the face through the open driver’s window, officials said. A turban Mr. Khalsa was wearing as part of his Sikh religion was disturbed in the attack, during which the men forced his head down and cut up to 10 inches of his hair with a knife, prosecutors said. “The savage cutting of Mr. Khalsa’s unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, constitutes a hate crime under the law,” the prosecutor’s office said in a news release. Mr. Little, who was taken into custody at the scene, was charged with assault and released that night on bail. He is to appear in court on Nov. 21. A warrant for Mr. Leblanc, who left the scene, has been issued, officials said. The other occupants of the pickup were not charged. Mr. Little and Mr. Leblanc were both charged with assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury and assault with a deadly weapon, with the “special allegation” that they were committed as hate crimes. With that enhancement, they could face a maximum of 11 years in prison, Mr. O’Connell said. It was not clear if Mr. Little had a lawyer, and neither man could be reached to comment on Friday. In a statement released through the Sikh Coalition, Mr. Khalsa said he was “violently targeted” because of his faith. “The charges are the first step to addressing violence and bigotry, which plague communities across the United States,” he said.

His little finger will be amputated at the first knuckle because of an infection from the knife wound, officials said.",0
22783,"Voices From Donald Trump’s Rallies, Uncensored - The New York Times","“Kill her. ” “Trump that bitch!” “Build a wall  —   kill them all. ” New York Times reporters have spent over a year covering Donald J. Trump’s rallies, witnessing so many provocations and heated confrontations at them that the cumulative effect can be numbing: A sharp sting that quickly dulls from repetition. But what struck us was the frequency with which some Trump supporters use coarse, vitriolic, even violent language  —   in the epithets they shout and chant, the signs they carry, the   they wear  —   a pattern not seen in connection with any other recent political candidate, in any party. Not everyone attending a Trump rally behaves this way. In fact, many are polite and well mannered. But while protesters are often shouted down, crowds seldom express disapproval of the crude slogans and angry outbursts by Mr. Trump’s supporters. Indeed, these displays have become inextricably bound with the Trump show itself  —   as much as the snaking entrance lines and the calls to “build a wall” along the border with Mexico. With that in mind, we set out to record the shouts, slogans, imprecations and interactions among audience members that set Trump events apart from other political gatherings. We also obtained recordings from others in attendance, who sometimes were closer to the action. The resulting compilation gives a sense of what we saw  —   from Maine to North Carolina, from Ohio to Arizona.",0

22785,Yemen Demands UN Designate Iran-Backed Houthis a Terrorist Organization,"Yemen’s President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi has formally requested that the United Nations brand the Shiite Houthi rebels a terrorist organization. The group has kept him out of the nation’s capital, Sanaa, since 2015. [The   Yemeni government sent a letter to the UN Security Council during the weekend decrying various attacks by Houthi rebels against government forces nationwide and accused the Shiite government of Iran of arming and emboldening the Houthi rebels into committing more flagrant acts of terrorism. The Hadi government is aligned with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iran’s longtime regional rival.  The formal request followed the publication of a UN report accusing the Houthi rebels of extraordinary acts of violence against both government fighters and civilians. The report also accused former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh of cooperating with the Houthis and aiding their use of torture against captured opponents. Highlighting the abuse of civilians by Houthi rebels, the Norwegian Refugee Council announced on Monday that Houthi rebels abducted twelve of its members last week as punishment for the group’s having attempted to distribute humanitarian aid to civilians. The Houthis claimed that the Saudi government paid for the aid, rendering it unfit for distribution. The United Nations estimated earlier this month that twelve million of the nation’s 19 million people are in desperate need of humanitarian aid, more than 60 percent. Saudi Arabia’s calls for the UN to intervene against Houthi activities and the exiled government in Aden’s demands to brand them a terrorist organization appear not only to target the Houthi faction but its main benefactor, Iran. Shortly before this plea to the United Nations, the Saudi government accused Iran of exporting terrorism at unparalleled rates. “Iran remains the single main sponsor of terrorism in the world,” Saudi Foreign Minister Adel   said at a security conference in Munich, Germany, last week. He added that “Iran is the only one in the Middle East that hasn’t been targeted by Islamic State and  . ” Both the Islamic State and   have established bases in Yemen.   in the Arabian Peninsula quadrupled its size since the civil war began two years ago. In response to Saudi critiques, the Iranian government has accused Riyadh of working “  ” with the region’s only democracy, Israel. Both the Iranian government and the Houthi rebels oppose the existence of Israel viscerally and harbor strong   sentiment. Iran routinely sends weapons shipments to Yemen to help the Houthis against a   coalition that continues to wage war against them on behalf of the nation’s legitimate government in Aden. The Houthis’ official slogan borrows somewhat from common Iranian propaganda tropes: “Allahu Akbar, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews, Victory to Islam. ” The slogan has garnered the Houthis so much international negative attention that the rebels officially apologized to the United States, according to Arabic news source     claiming it was meant for “domestic consumption” only. The Houthis have not issued similar statements to Israel or the global Jewish population. The reported apology rings somewhat hollow given recent reports that Houthi rebels have been attempting attacks on American ships in the region. Last month, the Houthis attacked a Saudi frigate in the Red Sea, killing two. A Pentagon official told Fox News that the Houthis appeared to believe the ship was American: “U. S. defense analysts believe those behind the attack either thought the bomber was striking an American warship or that this was a ‘dress rehearsal’ similar to the attack on the USS Cole. ” Multiple attempts to end the conflict via peace talks have failed, with one early   attempt ending in a fistfight and the latest attempt, by   of State John Kerry, met with extreme apathy. “The government was not aware of nor is it interested in what Secretary Kerry announced,” Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdulmalik   told reporters after asked about a   attempt to bring both sides back to the negotiating table.",0
22788,Should You Charge Your Phone Overnight? - The New York Times,"Chances are, you plug in your phone before you go to bed at night, thinking it’s best to greet the morning with a fully charged device. Is this a good idea? Here’s the thing. Many people don’t expect to keep their phones for much longer than two years. For the most part, experts say, those people are not going to notice much damage to their phone batteries before they start hankering for a new device. If that sounds like you, feel free to charge every night, and as often as you like in between. But frequent charging takes a toll on the   batteries in our phones. And it’s not because they can be overcharged, said Edo Campos, a spokesman for Anker, which produces phone chargers. “Smartphones are, in fact, smart,” Mr. Campos said. “They know when to stop charging. ” Android phones and iPhones are equipped with chips that protect them from absorbing excess electrical current once they are fully charged. So in theory, any damage from charging your phone overnight with an official charger, or a trustworthy   charger, should be negligible. But the act of charging is itself bad for your phone’s battery. Most phones make use of a technology that allows their batteries to accept more current faster. Hatem Zeine, the founder, chief scientist and chief technical officer of the wireless charging company Ossia, says the technology enables phones to adjust to the amount of charge that a charger is capable of supplying. The technology allows power to pulse into the battery in specific modulations, increasing the speed at which the lithium ions in the battery travel from one side to the other and causing the battery to charge more quickly. But this process also leads   (and  ) batteries to corrode faster than they otherwise would. “When you charge fast all the time, you limit the life span of the battery,” Mr. Zeine said. If you’re intent on preserving a   battery beyond the lifetime of the typical phone or tablet, Mr. Zeine suggested using a charger meant for a less powerful device, though he couldn’t guarantee that it would work. “For example, if you used an iPhone charger on an iPad Pro, it’s going to charge very slowly,” Mr. Zeine said. “If the electronics are right, they can actually preserve the battery because you’re always charging it slowly. ” People looking to preserve their batteries should make sure their phones don’t become overheated, Mr. Campos advised, because high temperatures further excite the   in batteries, leading to even quicker deterioration. Apple’s website says temperatures above 95 degrees Fahrenheit (or 35 Celsius) can “permanently damage battery capacity. ” Both Mr. Zeine and Mr. Campos noted that given the constant demand for new cellphones, charging overnight might not be a point of great concern for many people. “All this actually doesn’t make a huge difference for consumers,” Mr. Campos said, citing a 2015 Gallup survey showing that 44 percent of smartphone users planned to upgrade their devices as soon as their providers allowed it  —   usually after two years, about the length of time it takes for batteries to start showing signs of wear.",0
22789,57-ой гумконвой доставил еду и медикаменты в республики Донбасса,"Фото: АР 
Как сообщили ТАСС в пресс-службе министерства, непредвиденных ситуаций в пути не возникло, доставка гуманитарных грузов прошла штатно. 
На российско-украинской границе в присутствии представителей таможенной и пограничной служб Украины все автомобили прошли досмотр. Была проверена не только техника, но и сопроводительные документы на гуманитарный груз. 
""Сейчас на складах начинается разгрузка автомобилей в присутствии представителей органов местного самоуправления, которые занимаются распределением гуманитарной помощи, в том числе по социально значимым объектам Луганской и Донецкой областей. Как только последняя машина будет разгружена, все автомобили сразу отправятся в Ростовскую область"", — сказал представитель МЧС. 
Этот гуманитарный конвой стал для Донбасса 57-й по счету с середины августа 2014 года. За этот период для жителей Луганской и Донецкой областей было доставлено уже свыше 64 тысяч тонн гуманитарной помощи, груз обычно разделяется примерно поровну между ДНР и ЛНР. 
Помощь России помогла Донбассу избежать гуманитарной катастрофы. Для жителей юго-востока Украины доставляются предметы первой необходимости, медикаменты и школьные учебники. 
Грузы традиционно проходят таможенное оформление в присутствии таможенной и пограничной служб Украины в соответствии с международным законодательством. Но несмотря на это, украинская сторона регулярно обвиняет Россию в том, что гумконвои вторгаются на украинскую территорию и нарушают правила. 
Ранее руководитель МЧС России Владимир Пучков заверил, что Россия продолжит оказывать гуманитарную помощь Донбассу ""столько, сколько потребуется"". Об этом он рассказал в интервью телекомпании НТВ. По словам Пучкова, этот вопрос уже полностью согласован.

22791,5 New Sauces You Need to Master - The New York Times,"Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. Samin Nosrat joins us with a superlative article in the paper we delivered this morning to doorsteps and driveways across the nation. It’s about what she’s calling the new mother sauces. These are modernized versions of the five basic sauces of French cuisine that Samin has made appropriate to “the kind of     food that cooks and eaters favor today. ” They are yogurt sauce, pepper sauce, herb sauce, tahini sauce and pesto. We’ll be making those for the rest of the summer and probably forever after. So maybe we could get started tonight with some grilled   eggplants with tahini sauce or quickly broiled lamb with yogurt sauce. Or both. Let your imagination be your guide. Alternatively, you can make like the kids out at Achilles Heel in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, who Oliver Strand wrote about this week: They smoke chickens, braise them in chicken fat, then finish them over the grill for a   supper. You could do something similar this week for yourself off my recipe for smoked chicken wings, omitting the braise they use at the restaurant. Figure 30 minutes of smoke for a whole spatchcocked bird, then another 30 to 40 near the actual heat of the fire, turning often and basting with Alabama white barbecue sauce. (Use the leftovers for chicken enchiladas!) Holy cow. Continuing in this vein of narrative ideas for what to cook, let’s turn to Marilyn in Seattle, who is what they call in the radio game a      . She wrote Cooking recently to deliver a terrific   recipe for our Wednesday delectation:   summer corn shaved off the cob, tossed gently with blueberries and torn basil, and drizzled with   olive oil. We’ll take it with thanks, and pair the salad with some simply cooked salmon and a glass of the grüner veltliner Eric Asimov wrote about last week. That would make a superlative midweek supper. Won’t you join us in that as well? Or, you might make Florence Fabricant’s new recipe for grilled scallion lamb pair it with rice pilaf. Or you could make Tamar Adler’s recipe for   salad, a dinner for one that you can scale up with ease. We’re in love with David Tanis’s recipe for summer squash curry. And Melissa Clark’s recipe for classic shrimp scampi never goes out of style. Other recipes to cook this week are available on Cooking, each of them, of course, kitted out with the star ratings and notes by fellow users of the site and apps. Save the ones you’re interested in to your recipe boxes. And if anything goes sideways with the technology, our instruction or prose, please let us know about it: cookingcare@nytimes. com. Now, you should see this kid Viki Gomez ride a bicycle. You should read Sonny Kleinfield’s wonderful account of the full life of a voiceless man on the Upper East Side. And because I spent a full 30 minutes this week listening to a woman on the bus sing the refrain over and over, and it entered my head like a worm, you should turn up this Dottie Peoples song recorded back in 1994: “He’s an On Time God. ” Get cooking.",0

Más de 600 objetos han sido retirados de la estación meteorológica Schatzgraber, una instalación secreta de la Alemania nazi que fue recientemente descubierta en el Ártico ruso. 
""La colección está siendo catalogada en estos momentos. Más de 600 objetos han sido recogidos en el territorio de la estación"", dijo Irina Skálina, vicedirectora del Parque Nacional Ártico Ruso, en declaraciones a la agencia TASS . 
Entre los objetos encontrados destacan minas, granadas M-24, proyectiles, cajas con municiones, envases de combustible y conservas alimentarias. 
La base está situada en la isla Tierra de Alexandra, en el archipiélago de Tierra de Francisco José, y fue descubierta por una expedición rusa en agosto de este año. 
Según los archivos aparecidos, la estación llevaba el nombre de Schatzgraber, que en castellano significa 'buscador de tesoros'. 
Sin embargo, lo que los alemanes buscaban entre los hielos del Ártico no eran tesoros, sino información exacta sobre las condiciones climáticas en este área cercana a la base de submarinos alemana más septentrional. 
Esta base era de gran importancia para la Armada del III Reich, ya que la zona era utilizada por los buques británicos y soviéticos para suministrar los equipos bélicos y alimentos que los aliados mandaban a la URSS. ",0

22798,Paul Ryan on Obama’s Iran Deal: ’A Lot of That Toothpaste Is Already Out of the Tube’ - Breitbart,"Sunday  on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan ( ) said of the Obama administration’s nuclear agreement with Iran, “a lot of that toothpaste is already out of the tube,” so now “the key” was to “rigorously enforce” the deal.  Partial transcript as follows: TODD: Would you like to see the beginnings of trying to get out of the nuclear deal ? RYAN: A lot of that toothpaste is already out of the tube. I never supported the deal in the first place. I thought it was a huge mistake. But the multilateral sanctions are done. So —   TODD: Done meaning you’re not going to be able to put that back together —   SPEAKER PAUL RYAN: Yeah, I don’t think you’re going to go back and reconstitute the multilateral sanctions that were in place. TODD: Should we try, though? RYAN: So, I don’t think we —   I think we should expend our effort where it can pay off the most. And that’s why I think what they’re doing now does make a lot of sense. So I think the key is to rigorously enforce this deal. But also, remember, they’re testing ballistic missiles. They’re still the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Human rights abuses galore. And so those are where I think we also need to ratchet up sanctions. I think what this administration is doing, which I agree with, is saying, “We have a new administration, and we’re going to hold you, Iran, to account. ” This last administration did not do that. This new administration needs to do that. And I think that’s what you’re getting here. TODD: Where is the line here? Are you concerned that Iran might retaliate, and suddenly we’re a part of the proxy war in Yemen? I mean —   RYAN:But look what they were doing, we’re appeasing them already. So it couldn’t get worse —   TODD: You thought too much appeasement —   RYAN: Yeah, it couldn’t get any worse than what we already had. So I think they need to know that they’re going to be held to account. Because if left —   If we don’t do that, then they’re going to go off and do all these other things. Remember, they are a belligerent force in the Middle East. Look at what they’re trying to do to destabilize the region with all their proxies. Look at what they’re doing to finance terrorism, their human rights abuses, testing ballistic missiles. You see they write on the side of their ballistic missiles in Hebrew, Farsi and English, “Death to Israel and death to America. ” This is not a peaceful nation.

22800,Al-Nusra Linked Radical Islamists Raided in Germany and The UK,"Raids in the UK and the North   (NRW) region of Germany have led to the arrests of two Islamist sympathisers who are said to have been aiding the   Front in Syria. [Police in the German city of Karlsruhe announced the success of raids carried out Wednesday morning. They claimed the two suspects had been ardent supporters of   the formerly    terror group in Syria, for years and had been collecting money and aid for the group, Taggeschau reports.  The Federal Prosecutor’s Office released a statement on the raids saying the two individuals had used front groups to not only collect money for   but also to deliver medical supplies to them. “Ambulance vehicles, medical devices, medicines, and foodstuffs have been delivered to Syria,” they said. The two groups used by the suspects were Medicine of Heart and Medicine Without Borders, which is not said to have any affiliation with the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) organisation. Medicine Without Borders project manager Mohamed Belkaid is linked to radical Islamist preacher Brahim Belkaid who goes by the name Abu Abdullah and is   in the German   scene. According to NRW interior minister Ralf Jäger, the organisation had already been under observation from the domestic intelligence agency prior to the raid. The prosecutor noted the investigations were still ongoing and did not mention in the statement where in the UK the raids took place. The raids come after a crackdown by the German government on Islamist networks in the wake of the Berlin terror attack in December. Radical Islamist asylum seeker Anis Amri used a lorry to kill twelve people and injure almost 50 others at a Christmas market. Last week, German authorities raided radical Islamist Salafists across the country. 1, 100 police officers took part in the operation which saw  54 properties raided. The raids led to the arrest of 16 people including a Tunisian migrant who police say not only was plotting a terror attack in Germany but had also been responsible for an Islamic State attack in Tunisia in 2015. The attack led to the deaths of 21 people at the Bardo Museum in Tunis. Raids on Salafist networks have also been carried out in Austria in recent weeks after the arrest of a    Islamic State sympathiser who was plotting a terror attack in Vienna. Police arrested fourteen individuals who were plotting the overthrow of the government and the establishment of a radical Islamic caliphate.",0
22806,WikiLeaks: Obama Is A Saudi Agent,"Hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta released by WikiLeaks suggests that Obama may be working on behalf of the Saudi regime. 
Via YourNewsWire 
The 2008 email comes from Michael Froman, a former Citibank executive, who told Obama who to appoint in his cabinet team once elected President.
The email in question was even sent from Froman’s Citibank email address (rookie!) and includes “A list of African American, Latino and Asian American candidates, broken down by Cabinet/Deputy and Under/Assistant/Deputy Assistant level, plus a list of Native American, Arab/Muslim American and Disabled American candidates.”
Apparently Obama wasn’t as worried about placing women in senior-level positions but Froman decided to offer up some suggestions anyway.
“While you did not ask for this, I prepared and attached a similar document on women.” 
Froman even went ahead and “scoped out” which people should be appointed to which cabinet positions.
“At the risk of being presumptuous, I also scoped out how the Cabinet-level appointments might be put together, probability-weighting the likelihood of appointing a diverse candidate for each position (given one view of the short list) and coming up with a straw man distribution.” 

As New Republic points out, the Froman appointments ended up being almost entirely right.
The cabinet list ended up being almost entirely on the money. It correctly identified Eric Holder for the Justice Department, Janet Napolitano for Homeland Security, Robert Gates for Defense, Rahm Emanuel for chief of staff, Peter Orszag for the Office of Management and Budget, Arne Duncan for Education, Eric Shinseki for Veterans Affairs, Kathleen Sebelius for Health and Human Services, Melody Barnes for the Domestic Policy Council, and more. For the Treasury, three possibilities were on the list: Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner.
This was October 6. The election was November 4. And yet Froman, an executive at Citigroup, which would ultimately become the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis, had mapped out virtually the entire Obama cabinet, a month before votes were counted. And according to the Froman/Podesta emails, lists were floating around even before that.
Many already suspected that Froman, a longtime Obama consigliere, did the key economic policy hiring while part of the transition team. We didn’t know he had so much influence that he could lock in key staff that early, without fanfare, while everyone was busy trying to get Obama elected. The WikiLeaks emails show even earlier planning; by September the transition was getting pre-clearance to assist nominees with financial disclosure forms.

So if this history is any guide then the real power within a future Clinton administration is being formed right now. In fact, another email from January 2015 reveals that Elizabeth Warren was already “intently focused on personnel issues” almost two full years ago as evidenced by the following recap of a conversation that the Hillary campaign had with her Chief of Staff, Dan Geldon.
He was intently focused on personnel issues, laid out a detailed case against the Bob Rubin school of Democratic policy makers, was very critical of the Obama administration’s choices, and explained at length the opposition to Antonio Weiss. We then carefully went through a list of people they do like, which EW sent over to HRC earlier.
We spent less time on specific policies, because he seemed less interested in that.
He spoke repeatedly about the need to have in place people with ambition and urgency who recognize how much the middle class is hurting and are willing to challenge the financial industry.

To the extent there are any purists left, this should clear up any illusion of who controls the political powers that be.

22811,Boaty McBoatface II? P&O bravely asks the public to name its new ferry,"Boaty McBoatface II? P&O bravely asks the public to name its new... Boaty McBoatface II? P&O bravely asks the public to name its new ferry By 0 50 
The cruise company P&O has taken the plunge and decided to ask the public to name its new ferry. This comes in spite of the Boaty McBoatface debacle earlier this year. 
A 2016 attempt by the public to name a £200 million ($243 million) arctic research vessel Boaty McBoatface was foiled when the fun police decided it was just too daft. 
In a tweet posted on Wednesday, P&O threw caution to the wind, saying it is “ proud to announce that the name of our new ship… will be decided by you our guests! ” 
Read more 
Within minutes, Boaty McBoatface was reprised as a suggestion, alongside Cruisy McCruiseface and Shippy McShipface. 
Other suggestions ranged from Hard Brexit to Bryan Ferry, after the 1980s pop star. Sensing a deliberate cry for attention, another tweeter branded the ship HMS Social Media Gimmick. 
The original ‘Boaty McBoatface’ was eventually named RRS Richard Attenborough after the famed BBC explorer and zoologist. 
Earlier this year, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) asked the public to choose a name via the internet competition ‘ Name Our Ship, ’ but after the exceedingly popular moniker ‘ Boaty McBoatface ’ won the poll with more than 124,000 votes, the builders overruled the decision. 
In the face of public outcry, a small yellow submersible that will operate from the Richard Attenborough was christened Boaty McBoatface. 
The BBC naturalist attended the traditional keel-laying ceremony in Merseyside in October. 
The vessel will cost an estimated £200 million, and is the largest commercial shipbuilding project in Britain in over 30 years. It is expected to set sail to Antarctica in 2019, sending the most advanced research on the world’s oceans and climate change back to Britain. 
Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today program, Sir David confirmed that the infamous moniker will be put to use for an autonomous submarine serving the ship.

Veteran election reporter Jeremy Vine has embarked on his usual pre-election broadcast ritual by taking a load of drugs and hallucinating maps of the USA, pie-charts and various other election-themed visages. 
The least-funny of the Vine brothers usually waits until the polls close before cracking open his thermos flask full of hallucinogens, but has decided to get on it early this year. 
“I can’t say I blame him” said Lucy Millwall, Head of CGI for BBC News. 
“This election has been impressive only for sheer scale of mind-numbing awfulness. 
“Honestly, you try pretending to give a shit about what Gary Johnson is up to without yawning. 
“It’s actually intriguing watching him dance around an empty green room, imagining he’s kicking a football marked “Florida” between Trump and Clinton. 
“We just computer-generate images around whatever he’s imagining. Technically we are ‘enabling’ him but fuck it; it’s really good telly. 
“We’re always careful to cut away from him before he starts talking to Peter, the ‘Rapiest Giraffe of Them All’.” Jeremy Vine election coverage 
Jeremy Vine has been taking LSD ever since John Major’s first election victory; the campaign proving so overwhelmingly dull that recreational drug use became BBC protocol for several weeks. 
Vine is thought to be the only one to keep this up, apart from the Chuckle Brothers, who owe their youthful energy to a vigorous cocaine regimen. 
After ballot day, it is thought that Vine will commence the mother of all comedowns, which should wear off just before his next pre-election bender for a Brexit-inspired snap election sometime next month.

Trump’s loyal supporters had also taken notice of what they thought was CNN’s biased coverage of the Republican nominee.

At the third debate, Donald Trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election. 
Trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it. The media went berserk claiming that Trump was undermining democracy. But is the US system really rigged? And if it is, can Trump overcome it? 
Why rig the system? 
Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Revelation 12:12 
It is human nature to want to accumulate wealth. It is also human nature to want to keep what you have. One of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them. A democratic republic is particularly easy to influence. The wealthy elite can “buy” candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs.",0
22831,US-Supported Terrorists Shell Russian Embassy In Damascus,"US-Supported Terrorists Shell Russian Embassy In Damascus Published: November 1, 2016 
The Sleuth Journal 
They’ve done it before without causing casualties or damage. According the Russian Foreign Ministry, terrorists fired two mortar rounds at the embassy’s compound. 
One shell exploded near the diplomatic mission’s entrance, damaging the building and four vehicles. The attack came from terrorist-controlled Jobar district. 
On Friday, the Security Council addressed the incident, saying its “members…condemned in the strongest terms another mortar shelling of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Damascus (Syrian Arab Republic), which caused significant material damage.” 
They stressed the “fundamental principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises.” Host governments are obligated “to take all appropriate steps to protect diplomatic and consular premises against any intrusion or damage, and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of these missions or impairment of their dignity, and to prevent any attack on diplomatic premises, agents and consular officers.” 
Not easily done when countries are attacked by foreign-supported death squads, supplied with heavy weapons to wage war. 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed concern over no “international reaction…but we will try to get it,” she said, including on the platform of international organizations, because we are talking about a diplomatic mission, about systematic terrorist attacks.” 
Russian upper house Federation Council Security and Defense Committee first deputy chairman Frants Klintesevich believes the latest shelling was conducted to disrupt Moscow’s humanitarian pause, saying it failed – nor can there be an “option of making any concessions to terrorists.” 
Separately, heavily US-led Western pressure got General Assembly members to vote Russia off the UN Human Rights Council – a body infested with major human rights abusers, including reelected member Saudi Arabia with over a three-fourths majority vote. 
Ignored was its genocidal war on Yemen, ruthless despotic rule tolerating no dissent, arbitrary arrests and imprisonments, torture and physical abuse, public beheadings and whippings, violence against women, along with other major violations of civil and human rights. 
Russia, Hungary and Croatia vied for two Eastern European seats. Moscow’s UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said “(i)t was a very close vote and very good countries competing, Croatia, Hungary. They are fortunate because of their size, they are not exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. Russia is very exposed. We’ve been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in.” 
Not easily as long as Washington maintains pressure to prevent it. US-led NATO’s undeclared war on Russia continues. Hillary’s ascension to power next year threatens to turn it red hot.

22835,Tape Reveals Bill Clinton Urging Mistress To Deny He Helped Her Get Job," 
Recorded audio of a series of phone conversations between former President Bill Clinton and his mistress, Gennifer Flowers, have recently surfaced.
In one of the recordings, from 1991, Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, is heard advising Flowers to deny any claims that he had aided her in getting a state job.
“If they ever asked if you’d talked to me about it, you can say no,” he says.
 
Related Stories Bill Clinton Leads Crowd In Litany Of Obamacare’s Failures Wikileaks: Bill Clinton Accepted ‘Expensive Gifts’ From CGI Donors Activist Who Documented DNC’s ‘Dirty Tricks’ Operation Joining Trump At Debate The recording was released Wednesday on Breitbart .

At the time of the recording, the media had been asking many questions about Clinton’s affair with Flowers and she was worried that the barrage of questions could inevitably lead to inquires into how she landed her job as an administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
 
A complaint was being filed by an anonymous woman who felt that Flowers’ relationship with Clinton kept her from getting the job when, the woman claimed, she was more qualified.
In the audio, Clinton is heard coaching Flowers on how best to deal with the woman and subsequent questions that may arise.
The sections of the audio recordings dealing with the state job were given to the news media in 1992. This came just one day after Clinton had appeared on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary — the current Democratic presidential nominee — blatantly denying any romantic relationship with Flowers.
However, in his deposition for a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones, Clinton would eventually admit to having a sexual interaction with Flowers in 1998.

But it wasn’t until now that she turned over the full original recordings to a Breitbart reporter.
The timing of the leak comes at a time when — amid recent sexual harassment allegations against Republican nominee Donald Trump — Clinton has had a number of people questioning his treatment of women.

Moscow is calling for a thorough investigation of the attack on a school in the Syrian province of Idlib and other incidents, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Walid Muallem, and Iran’s top diplomat Javad Zarif. 
""The Idlib school attack has been very much hyped lately,"" the Russian minister said. ""The allegations particularly lay the blame on Russia and Syria. We are being accused of delivering the airstrikes that hit the school. In response to these assertions, Russia’s Defense Ministry has shared some facts that disprove the accusations and show that this media hype has been biased."" 
""I would also like to mention that on the same day a mine hit a school in western Aleppo and at the same time, militants from eastern Aleppo shelled a humanitarian corridor set up near that school,"" the minister continued. ""As a result, 12 civilians were killed and 20 wounded. It is impossible to distort this information. Our journalists have visited this area and recorded this absolutely inhuman crime that the insurgents active in eastern Aleppo had committed."" 
All these incidents need to be thoroughly investigated, the Russian top diplomat stressed. 
At the same time, Lavrov noted that ""Russia and Iran welcome the Syrian government’s readiness to enhance cooperation with the UN in tackling humanitarian issues, that was confirmed today"". ""We believe that the UN representatives should act impartially, and refrain from responding to provocations,"" the Russian minister emphasized.",0

While elite media wait for the resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline to go away so they can return to presenting their own chin-stroking as what it means to take climate change seriously , independent media continue to fill the void with actual coverage. 
One place you can go to find reporting is The Intercept ( 10/25/16 ), where journalist Jihan Hafiz filed a video report from North Dakota, where the Standing Rock Sioux and their allies continue their stand against the sacred site--trampling, water supply--threatening project. 
Hafiz reports that after a morning of prayer, Standing Rock activists 
were attacked by police forces who used pepper spray and beat protesters with batons"". Dozens of officers, backed by military trucks, police vans, machine guns and nonlethal weapons, violently approached the group without warning. 
As the demonstrators attempted to leave, the police began beating and detaining them. Several Native American women leading the march were targeted, dragged out of the crowd and arrested. One man was body-slammed to the ground, while another woman broke her ankle running from the police. The military and police trucks followed the protesters, as nearly a hundred officers corralled them into a circle. Among the arrested were journalists--including Hafiz--a pregnant 17-year-old and a 78-year-old woman. - Advertisement - 
Once jailed, Hafiz and others were refused phone calls and received no food or water for eight hours. Women were strip-searched, two women fainted from low blood sugar and another had her medication taken away. 
On her release, Hafiz was told, ""Your camera is being held as evidence in a crime."" 
That crime, of course, would be journalism . And it's hard to believe law enforcement would feel so cavalier about treating it that way if more reporters were actually committing it. Protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline License DMCA - Advertisement -

Meanwhile, large numbers of pro-government protesters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace in a show of support for Maduro.

[Urban Myths: A Brand New Collection of Comedies consists of eight episodes featuring some of the most legendary tall tales about celebrities. In the Michael Jackson episode, Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor (Stockard Channing) and Marlon Brando (Brian Cox) take a   road trip after the September 11 terrorist attacks.  Other episodes reportedly tackle     stories about Cary Grant, Bob Dylan, Muhammad Ali, Alice Cooper, Samuel Beckett, the Sex Pistols and even a young Adolf Hitler. Fiennes’ casting as Jackson drew intense criticism when it was announced last year. The actor later defended the role in an interview with the Associated Press, though he said he was as “shocked” as anyone to have been casted in the part. “I deal in imagination, so I don’t think imagination should have rules stamped on them,” he told the AP. “If it promotes stereotyping, then it’s wrong.

22849,Colombia & FARC Rebels Sign New Peace Deal,"Colombia & FARC Rebels Sign New Peace Deal Nov 13, 2016 1 0 
On Saturday, the Colombian government signed a revised peace deal with the FARC Rebels, which comes after years of negotiation to end the fighting that has been taking place for over 50 years. A milestone for Columbia and humanity. 
Earlier this summer, the initial peace deal was agreed to but then came under scrutiny when it was deemed to be favorably leaned towards the rebels. In October , the country held a vote on whether the deal reached in the summer should be agreed to. In a somewhat surprising vote, the country voted no to the peace deal. 
After a few more weeks of dialogue, the sides have now once again come to an agreement on the peace deal. The new deal will include support from other social peacemaking groups as well as ensure that victims of FARC crimes are paid financial compensation. 
The FARC will still be able to form a political party and members with minor offenses can apply to get their records cleared. 
The FARC Rebels rose to prominence in the 1980’s and 90’s as they were able to utilize drug trafficking money to build their movement. At it’s height, it was said to be the “largest and best-equipped guerrilla force in Latin America.” 
One of the chief negotiators of the FARC guerrillas, Ivan Marquez, said : 
“The new peace accord is the victory for Colombia.” 
This Colombian peace deal isn’t the only major peace deal signed this year either. In late September , the Afghanistan government signed a peace deal with Hezb-i-Islami, which is the first peace deal the government has signed with a group since the war with the Taliban started in 2001. 
Let us all continue to focus on and spread the good news that these peace deals have brought. Though we cannot ignore the violence that has been happening around the world, we can work together to bring about peaceful change. War is a lose-lose situation, whereas peace is a win-win situation. Are there other peace deals that have occurred around the world this year? Are there others in process? How about even on a small level? Let us know other great and peaceful events that are taking place throughout the world in the comments section. 
What are your thoughts about the Colombian and Afghan peace deals just recently signed?

22850,GRAPHIC: Mexican Border State Authorities Unearth Bodies in Shallow Graves,"MONTERREY, Nuevo Leon  —   The discovery of two bodies in shallow graves near this city set off a forensic investigation to identify two more victims of cartel violence. [The discovery was reported by Nuevo Leon law enforcement officials after they responded to the discovery of what appeared to be human remains near the La Huasteca State Park in the Santa Catarina suburb of this industrial city, information provided to Breitbart Texas by state authorities revealed. Investigators arrived at the scene and after locating some remains, an   search of the area near the Rompepicos Dam found irregularities in the ground, pointing to a grave having been dug.   Inside the two shallow graves, authorities found the heavily decomposed remains of a woman and a man they have not been identified. While investigators would not reveal if the victims had been shot, they confirmed that both had their hands tied in a manner consistent with victims kidnapped by cartel members.  Even though the remains were heavily decomposed, authorities were able to extract DNA samples and are expected to run them with various government databases for missing persons in an effort to identify them. Law enforcement sources revealed to Breitbart Texas that the area near Santa Catarina is currently under dispute by rival factions of the Los Zetas cartel. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, the faction known as the Old Zetas has been waging a fierce war throughout Mexico against the faction known as Cartel Del Noreste. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

22858,5 Bodies Found Off Libya Amid Fears That 200 Migrants May Have Drowned - The New York Times,"The bodies of five people were found near two capsized dinghies off the coast of Libya on Thursday, and the aid organization that recovered the bodies said it feared that more than 200 migrants may have drowned. Laura Lanuza, a spokeswoman for the organization, Proactiva Open Arms, said in a telephone interview that a search was underway for another migrant vessel believed to have run into trouble in the same part of the Mediterranean. While it was not clear how many people were aboard the capsized dinghies, she said that boats of that type often get overloaded with 120 to 140 migrants hoping to reach southern Europe. “We fear the worst,” Ms. Lanuza said. The discovery and the search come amid signs that the number of African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean increased over the winter compared with a year ago  —   with tragic consequences. Since the start of this year, 559 people have died or disappeared while crossing the Mediterranean, according to the latest data from the International Organization for Migration. In 2016, 5, 098 migrants died or disappeared while undertaking the journey, according to the International Organization for Migration, but the number of attempted crossings normally picks up significantly after the winter, once the weather and conditions at sea improve. Since the start of the year, Proactiva Open Arms said that it alone had rescued about 2, 000 migrants lost at sea. “Everything suggests that the flux has risen this winter,” Ms. Lanuza said. The five corpses were found on Thursday morning about 13 miles off Sabratha, one of the ports along the Libyan coast from where human traffickers are believed to put migrants aboard overcrowded and flimsy dinghies. Based in Catalonia, Proactiva is one of the private groups that have recently been involved in efforts to prevent African migrants from drowning on the Mediterranean crossing. Its founder, Oscar Camps, has also been one of the strongest critics of the response of the European Union and its member states to the migration crisis. “The sea is like a carpet that governments are now lifting to brush underneath their dirt,” he said in an interview last fall. Alongside Proactiva Open Arms, which is using a fishing boat converted into a rescue vessel, Ms. Lanuza said that another rescue boat operated by Jugend Rettet, a German aid organization, was also searching the area. The two boats are sailing in international waters with the support of the Italian coast guard, which earlier on Thursday confirmed the recovery of the five corpses, according to Reuters.",0

To be white and from money is to live a life of largely unrecognized privilege, bequeathed as it is from one’s first wet, howling breath. In the affluent socio-economically partitioned town of Saratoga Springs, NY where I’m from there was actually a railroad track serving as the demarcation line between affluent whites residing on one side and the other side of which nothing was known because you just didn’t go there, ever. It was literally the “wrong side of the tracks”. 
Raised in that remarkable state of incurious joy and suffering within narrow undiluted lines of stratified suburban sameness, I could not know or question the things kept from sight. Thus racial determinism was assumed passively, an acquired naivete fueled with the aspirational angst of middle class parenting that served as an omniscient narcotic fog, like carbon monoxide – not enough to be lethal, but just enough to render the critical faculties permanently dull until finally the things kept from sight could no longer be seen even upon close observation. 
To be white is to watch but not see while being seen but never watched. It is to know that for whatever law enforcement is or is not, they are something that will never have anything to do with me. It is to know that on those rare occasions I am pulled over, it really is about a busted tail light.

[Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W. H. Council.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017,   Yates is testifying publicly for the first time in front of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee. She is expected to discuss how she went to the White House counsel Don McGahn on January 26 with classified information that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had talked about U. S. sanctions on Moscow with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. That classified information was shortly after illegally leaked to the Washington Post, on February 9, leading to Flynn’s resignation, since he had previously told Vice President Mike Pence that he had not discussed that topic. “Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to the W. H. Council,” Trump tweeted. Trump also reminded his followers in an earlier tweet that Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama administration, amid accusations that he did not properly vet the retired Army   general, who had last served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration  —   but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.  —   Donald J.

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper is also testifying along with Yates. He said in March that by the time he left the government in January, he had seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. FBI Director James Comey has confirmed an investigation into Russian interference in the elections had begun in July. Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice was invited to testify on Monday, but declined the invite after her lawyer said the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee had disagreed with the invite, calling her testimony not relevant to the hearing topic, which is Russian influence on the U.

22882,Obama Donations Funneled Through Fake Bonuses,"Obama Donations Funneled Through Fake Bonuses   
This is some great investigative work. And it's the kind of story that flies under the radar and it's just a small component of the Democratic machine. But it is what the setup looks like . 
Jon Tester didn’t come all the way from Montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon. The US senator, virtually unknown in Boston, was in a conference room at the Thornton Law Firm that June morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the Democratic fund-raising circuit, a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians. 
Tester, a massive, jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm, was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests, all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys. But the drill was basically the same. The personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes, then returned to their offices. And Tester walked away with $26,400 in checks. 
But a striking thing happened the day Tester visited in 2010. Partner David C. Strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a “bonus” that exactly equaled his $2,400 contribution to Tester’s campaign, the maximum allowed. A few days later, partner Garrett Bradley — until recently the House assistant majority leader on Beacon Hill — got a bonus, too, exactly matching his $2,400 gift to Tester. 
That's quite a coincidence. 
From 2010 through 2014, Strouss and Bradley, along with founding partner Michael Thornton and his wife, donated nearly $1.6 million to Democratic Party fund-raising committees and a parade of politicians — from Senate minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Hawaii gubernatorial candidate David Ige to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Over the same span, the lawyers received $1.4 million listed as “bonuses” in Thornton Law Firm records; more than 280 of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within 10 days. 
No corruption to see here. Now let's move on to another fake scandal. 
Thornton’s lawyers were especially generous to Vice President Joe Biden, one of Washington’s strongest advocates for trial lawyers, contributing more than $78,000 to his campaigns from 2003 to 2008. 
During President Obama and Biden’s reelection campaign in 2012, Michael Thornton hosted a fund-raiser for the Obama Victory Fund at his house in Cambridge, where Biden was the guest of honor. Some of the biggest donors — some Thornton partners gave $20,000 — were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with Biden, said someone who was there. Thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations.

22885,Gun Violence Researchers Fear Trump Will Erase Their Data - Breitbart,"Researchers in UC Davis’s Violence Prevention Research Program are worried President Trump will simply erase their data the way his administration erased climate change data from the White House web site. [The fear took hold on inauguration day, when members of the Violence Prevention Research Program watched the Climate Change information disappear.  Wired reports that Magdalena Cerdá saw the Climate Change information vanish and viewed is as a “call to action. ” She said she “worried the same thing could happen to gun violence data on websites belonging to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ” Cerdá was on an Amtrak train when she noticed the Climate Change material disappearing and she “sent an email to Garen Wintemute saying [they] needed to start downloading   …     data immediately. ” The goal was to get all the online resource material saved to a   drive so they would have it, even if an outside party ordered it removed or inaccessible on the internet. Veronica Pear is a data analyst at the Violence Prevention Research Center. She said, “I was scared. ” Pear is using “federal data for a paper on firearm mortality —  tracking hotspots in California between 1999 and 2015 —  and her work is almost complete. ” She said she had grown accustomed to finding the information she needed via online searches, and had therefore never downloaded or backed anything up. But once Cerda announced the erasure of Climate Change information, Pearl began searching and storing information. She said, “I had to enter around 50 different queries, I felt frantic. ” UC Davis now has untold numbers of resources saved on secure servers. Pear described the compilation of the material as “a public service for the scientific community. ” She added, “And for me, it feels more important now than ever to be vocally on the side of truth. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

Chris Christie was once one of Trump’s fiercest critics – shortly before endorsing him. Since that time, Christie has bounced from humiliation to humiliation at the hands of Trump. Stories of Trump’s schoolyard bullying of Christie range from the time he made the Governor of New Jersey get him french fries, to the time he publicly mocked his weight, to the time he told Christie to get off the stage and wait on the plane, to the time he suggested Christie could be vice president only to change him mind at the last minute and pick Mike Pence instead. 
The last 16 months have been hard on Christie. The indignities were written all over his face as he walked, alone and in the dark , towards the voting booth in New Jersey. A man, broken and demoralized, casting a vote for the guy who routinely humiliated him. If a picture says a thousand words, then what does this say? Here's a picture of Christie going to vote this morning at 6:06 am, right when polls opened. He didn't tell press. https://t.co/3QIgk1sgBW pic.twitter.com/tJEMSwN1y0 
— Annie-Rose Strasser (@ARStrasser) November 8, 2016 
Perhaps nobody in America had a worse year than Gov. Chris Christie – and nobody has deserved his comeuppance more. All but conceding that his time in politics was over, the deeply unpopular governor ignored the job he was elected to do in New Jersey to fly around the country with Donald Trump. Those fast food orders weren’t going to pick up themselves. 
In the meantime, the “Bridgegate” scandal that had torched his administration was drawing to a close, with several of his former advisers implicating Christie himself in the plan to shut down traffic to punish a political rival. Just last week, things reached their inevitable conclusion with many of his closest staffers being convicted of the crimes. Christie, who has no possible route to office ever again, seems to understand that 2016 marked a Rubicon of sorts. He crossed the river and there is no going back. His reputation, his lifetime’s work in government, his chances for a future presidency, have all gone up in smoke. 
And so he drudged in the bitterly cold New Jersey pre-dawn towards the ballot box. Broken, beaten, and hollow. Chris Christie casts his vote for Donald Trump; his abuser, yes, but also the only man who will take his calls.

22892,Trump Appoints Head Of FBI James Comey To Supreme Court,"  Feeling sad... 
When Rudy Giuliani heard that Donald Trump planned to appoint head of the FBI James Comey to the US Supreme Court, Giuliani went ballistic, claiming that the job was promised. 
Nah, Trump was reported as saying, adding that Comey gave him the White House, lock, stock and Air Force One, by holding crooked Hillary's feet to the fire with her lousy mail server for the last two years. 
Besides, Comey also sent Martha Stewart to the clinker for insider trading. She should have taken full responsibility for my low ratings and failure on Celebrity Apprentice when she bombed on her program, The Apprentice: Martha Stewart. 
Giuliani would not be pacified. He then demanded an appointment as head of the CIA. 
Trump said that Vladimir Putin was getting that job. After all, Putin used to be head of the KGB and pitched in like a trooper with emails every time Trump's ratings started to sink. He also set up the rumors for Comey's letter about Huma Abedin, or whatever the woman's name. 
There was one job left that Giuliani was willing to accept and that was head of the FBI. 
Nope! Trump explained that that job would be going to Julian Assange, after as president, Trump pardoned Assange. Assange knew all about hacking and leaks, and he kicked in with the DNC leaks and Podesta's emails, and he has been eating tacos stuck in the Ecuador Embassy in London for the last five years. 
""And those English tacos aren't so hot."" 
""They eat tacos in Mexico not Ecuador."" 
""Mexico, Ecuador, Portugal, they're all the same bag."" 
He went on to explain that while the Trump Tower tacos aren't exactly Michelin Star quality, they're better than English tacos and he planned to appoint Mr. Michelin to something in government to acquire at least one star for Trump Tower tacos. 
So, I'm getting nothing? Giuliani wailed. 
Giuliani was reminded that he was married three times, and they couldn't piss off Sarah Palin and the Evangelicals because of his history. But he'd make a perfect press secretary...He'll drive the press crazy talking all day.

La energía que hasta ahora recibían los abonados de Endesa, una de las empresas españolas líderes en el sector eléctrico, en realidad provenía de un enchufe de Iberdrola. La noticia se hacía pública esta misma mañana después de que la señora de la limpieza de Iberdrola encontrara un extraño cable enchufado a una regleta oculta tras un mueble. Al ir tirando de él, la mujer ha llegado a la sede de la otra compañía, destapando el fraude. 
“No había visto a mi jefe tan enfadado en la vida. Me ha ordenado desenchufar el cable inmediatamente y se ha ido a gritarle al de Iberdrola desde la calle”, explica la señora. Nada más desenchufarse el cable, los clientes de Endesa han dejado de recibir electricidad. 
En estos momentos, Iberdrola, con su presidente José Ignacio Sánchez Galán a la cabeza, está revisando uno a uno todos los enchufes de la oficina, “no vaya a ser que también nos la estén jugando los de Fenosa o los de Abengoa, que son todos una panda de listos”. Según él, “llamas a la Policía y te dicen que no pueden hacer nada si no ha habido agresión o robo con fuerza”.

Endesa ha informado que sus abonados experimentarán los próximos días algunos cortes en el servicio mientras sus responsables buscan otro enchufe al que conectar su red. En estos momentos, la solución más factible para Endesa es encontrar un alargador de varios kilómetros de longitud para poder robar la energía de Francia “porque allí no están tan pendientes”.",0
22897,Единым махом тринадцатерых побивахом!,"Происшествия 
Поцарапать чужое авто, пытаясь припарковаться на нетрезвую голову – это в нашей стране в порядке вещей. Многие автомобилисты, предусмотрительно оформившие КАСКО, даже пользуются возможностью за счёт страховой компании дважды в год выровнять и закрасить появившиеся царапины, ибо появление таковых в наших реалиях просто неизбежно. Особенно в том случае, если машина стоит во дворе. Но недавно житель Воронежа поставил своеобразный рекорд по повреждению машин в процессе парковки. 
Своими невероятными маневрами 45-летний воронежец повредил не один и не два – а сразу тринадцать автомобилей! Разъезжая на своём авто Toyota Cresta по дворовой территории на улице Шишкова, он умудрился совершить наезды на: ВАЗ-2105, два Ford Focus, три ГАЗели, ВАЗ-2106, три Лады-Калины, Great Wall, Daewoo Matiz и ВАЗ-21099. На не самом счастливом числе «13» водитель свои эксперименты прекратил. 
Как сообщают правоохранители, пострадали в результате парковочного лихачества только автомобили – людей поблизости, к счастью, не оказалось. В ходе медицинского освидетельствования выяснилось, что уровень алкогольного опьянения виновника ухудшившегося настроения всех 13 владельцев поцарапанных машин составил 0,25 мг на один литр. Самое интересное — то, что это всего лишь около 0,6 промилле. С таким уровнем алкогольного опьянения запрещено управлять транспортным средством, однако он существенно ниже, чем количество промилле даже при лёгкой степени опьянения (которое предусматривает 1,0-2,0 промилле). 
В отношении водителя завели административное делопроизводство. Теперь ему либо присудят штраф в 30 тысяч рублей, либо лишат права управлять автомобилем на срок от 1,5 до 2 лет. А вот владельцам помятых авто придётся оббивать пороги своих страховых компаний. 
Недоумение вызывает даже не столько феноменальная способность за одну парковку поцарапать столько машин, сколько способность входить в настолько пьяное состояние после, в общем-то, незначительного количества выпитого спиртного. Тут можно было бы пошутить про водку, которая у русских «в крови», если бы не печальная статистика безуспешной борьбы с вождением в нетрезвом виде.",0
22898,Swedish Police Officers Torn from Patrol Car During Riot,"A pair of Swedish police in Stockholm were torn from their police car and had it stolen during a riot outside a nightclub hosting a hip hop concert that involved up to 40 people. [The mass brawl broke out between Thursday and Friday in the Colosseum nightclub where UK rapper “Sneakbo”  was performing a concert in the Swedish capital. Police say a pair of officers arrived on the scene and were dragged from their police car by members of the mob who then stole the car which was recovered a short time later, Afton Bladet reports.  Press officer for the Stockholm police   Olsson said: “I can not say the circumstances, but it was an event related to a violent riot on the site. Police spotted the vehicle and found it after ten minutes. ” According to police, at least 40 people were involved in the riot which broke out at around midnight but authorities have not commented as to the cause of the violence. Security guards are said to have alerted police and at least one man has been arrested for various offences including assault on a police officer, rioting, minor drug offences, and other counts of assault. Duty officer for the Stockholm police Nicklas Mattsson said the police presence was larger than just the one patrol car saying: “There were lots of young people who fought and fought. We were there with a number of patrols. ” “There were many young people who drove around in the area. It was messy, both inside the restaurant and outside. It was going back and forth,” he added. The UK rapper who headlined the event, known as “Sneakbo” is also no stranger to the police. Sneakbo, real name Agassi Babatunde Odusina, has been arrested and tried for threatening to kill a woman and her two children in 2011 but was spared prison time by a judge who thought it may harm Odusina’s music career. The attack is the latest incident of violence toward police officers in Sweden which is facing a crisis as more and more police are considering other forms of work. A report claimed that up to 80 per cent of the police force in Sweden were looking at different careers. Even the ambulance service in Sweden is requesting military defence gear in order to perform their duty in the various No Go Zones in Swedish cities. Head of the ambulance driver’s union Gordon Grattidge said paramedics are routinely forced to leave various no go areas or risk being attacked by the residents, many of whom come from migrant backgrounds.

22899,"U.S.-Backed Afghan Government Funding Taliban Schools, Hospitals","The U. S.   Afghan government is reportedly funding schools and hospitals operated by the Taliban as the terrorist group attempts to establish itself as a legitimate administration in the large swathes of the country under its control. [“They are trying to set up a    —   if not the actual state  —   in Helmand,” Auliya Atrafi, a journalist from the BBC Afghan service who made a film about the deteriorating security conditions there, told the Telegraph.  “In the evening when we sat with the [Taliban] elders and the local leaders, they asked us: ‘Where do you think we will be in 10 years time?’ We knew what they were thinking. They see themselves in ten years time as the government,” added the BBC journalist. Citing the U. S. forces in Afghanistan, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) revealed that jihadists, primarily the Taliban, contest or control 40 percent of Afghanistan. In particular, the Taliban controls or influences 64 percent (nine of 14 districts) of   Helmand province, located along the Pakistan border next to Kandahar, the birthplace of the terrorist group. The Telegraph reports that the Taliban controls at least 80 percent of Helmand province, considered one of the deadliest provinces of the ongoing    war for the   coalition and their Afghan allies. Taliban jihadists generate 60 percent of its funding from the illicit opium business in Afghanistan, the world’s top producer of the poppy plant, according to the U. S. military. The American government has invested more than $117 billion in U. S. taxpayer funds on reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. Most of those funds (more than $71 billion) have been devoted to training, housing, equipping, and sustaining the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) in their fight against the Taliban and other jihadist groups. Nevertheless, the Telegraph points out, “the Afghan government is funding schools and hospitals run by the Taliban as the militant group seeks to establish itself as a legitimate administration in large swathes of the country, a new film has found. ” “A report by a BBC team granted rare access to the group’s stronghold in Helmand province found the Taliban has been forced to present itself as somewhat modernized since Afghans have grown used to government services and a different way of life after the group was ousted from official power,” it adds. An estimated 300 U. S. Marines have recently returned to the   Helmand. The U. S.  coalition overthrew the Taliban regime in 2001, soon after invading Afghanistan in response to the   attacks on the U. S homeland. Afghanistan has been gripped by a Taliban resurgence since former President Barack Obama declared an end to the U. S. combat mission at the end of 2014. “The Taliban has grown in confidence three years since Western troops withdrew from the country,” declares the Telegraph.",0

При этом в МИД России заявили о предвзятости следствия, выводы которого основаны только на данных, полученных от Украины. Эксперименты концерна ""Алмаз-Антей"" также подтверждают, что Boeing был сбит с территории, контролировавшейся украинской армией. 
Всероссийский центр изучения общественного мнения (ВЦИОМ) недавно провел исследование, согласно которому только 4% россиян верят в версию Запада о причастности ополченцев ЛДНР и российских спецслужб к крушению Boeing МН-17 в Донбассе . 
""Малайзийский Boeing, сбитый над территорией Донбасса более двух лет назад, половина россиян (50%) считает жертвой нападения украинских военных. С предположением о виновности западных спецслужб согласны 14% наших сограждан. Терактом называют произошедшее 8% респондентов. К настоящему моменту катастрофа получила крайне широкий резонанс в российском обществе: о ней слышали почти все жители страны"", - говорится в материалах опроса ВЦИОМ, опубликованных на сайте организации. 
О результатах расследования международной следственной группы, в которых утверждается, что самолет был сбит с территории, контролировавшейся ополченцами Донбасса, из пусковой установки, привезенной из России, знают 64% россиян. При этом каждый пятый (21%) не видит значимых последствий для России в связи с выводами комиссии по расследованию инцидента, две пятых (40%) затруднились сказать, может ли оно как-то повлиять на нашу страну и граждан. 
Из результатов опроса следует, что версии о причастности к атаке на самолет ополченцев ДНР и ЛНР либо российских спецслужб крайне непопулярны: о том, что в них верят, сказали, соответственно, 4% и 1% опрошенных. 
В опросе приняли участие 1600 человек в 130 населенных пунктах в 46 областях, краях и республиках всех федеральных округов России. 
Напомним, что международная группа следователей пришла к выводу, что малайзийский Боинг был сбит ракетой «Бука», который якобы был доставлен ополченцам из России.

22902,Khloe K's Photo With New Beau Has People Wondering Why She’d Post Such a Glam Pic After What Happened to Kim,"Getty - Cindy Ord/Allergan 
Reality star Khloe Kardashian is just one signature away from being officially divorced from ex-basketball player Lamar Odom. 
As Us Weekly reports , the almost single Kardashian is now spending a lot of time with another professional basketball player, Cleveland Cavalier power forward Tristan Thompson. Khloe Kardashian traveled to Cleveland to support Tristan Thompson as he received his NBA championship ring. https://t.co/pHHPY6bk29 pic.twitter.com/2hG4Ysapfi — EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) October 26, 2016 
In fact, the 32-year-old denim designer was seen cheering on her new boyfriend during the Cavaliers game against the New York Knicks on October 25th. 
That same game, Thompson and the rest of his team received their championship rings for winning the NBA final last year. 
Kardashian was sure to document the occasion on social media, posting a picture of the enormous, 14-karat gold championship ring encrusted with 216 diamonds. The picture posted to her Instagram not only featured Thompson's ring, but also a few of her own diamond rings as well: ❤️ A photo posted by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Oct 25, 2016 at 8:54pm PDT 
The photo — simply captioned with a red heart — is causing a lot of people to wonder if Khloe learned anything from her sister's traumatic experience in Paris just three weeks ago. 
While attending Paris Fashion Week, Kim was tied up, gagged, and held at gunpoint while five masked men ransacked her apartment, stealing $10 million worth of her jewelry. Kanye was performing at a concert in New York as it went down. 
While in Paris, Kim posted a picture of her $4 million engagement ring from husband Kanye, which is rumored to be among the stolen jewelry. A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 29, 2016 at 12:40pm PDT 
Before the robbery, the Kardashian clan had been warned by police about the dangers of social media. Even fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who is no stranger to flaunting his wealth, told reporters that Kim needed to tone down her display of wealth on social media. 
Following the incident with sister Kim, Khloe's picture on social media has followers asking: 
“That's how she gets robbed.” 
“Didn't you learn from what happened to your sister? Shouldn't flash your fancy jewelry on social media.” 
“Good luck showing all that bling. How's Kim holding up?” 
“#ThenGetsRobbed” 
“Your sister was robbed and you are still posting bling? Have you learned nothing?” 
“I love you, but didn't you learn anything from your sister's robbery? Why flash every jewel you have?” 
Since the robbery, Kim has kept a very low profile , spending more time with her kids and her family and less time working and making appearances. Kim Kardashian has ‘cancelled everything,’ KUWTK filming is placed ‘on hold indefinitely’ https://t.co/GusRncKLBb pic.twitter.com/OVsfmnRh7L — Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) October 6, 2016 
Khloe's photo also sparked engagement rumors, but a source close to the Kardashian family says that the couple isn't heading down the aisle... yet. 
After Kim's incident, it might be best for the Kardashians to keep photos of their expensive jewelry few and far between. ",0
22903,IT’S TRUE: Someone IS Trying To Intimidate Voters At The Polls (VIDEO),"Republican operative Roger Stone has made an entire career out of deplorable actions. He is a close friend and confidant of the Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump. 
In fact, Stone is working with the Trump campaign to organize volunteers. Isn’t that special? 
Most campaigns, of course, organize the volunteer brigade to knock on doors and chat with people about the candidate. Some gather willing folks to make calls, reminding people about when and where to vote. 
The Trump campaign, as the world knows, is definitely not your average campaign. Definitely. Roger Stone is not the typical campaign advisor either. 
Stone is reaching deep into the basket of deplorables to find each volunteer. His plan is not to have them get out the vote. In fact just the opposite is true. 
Apparently the Republican nasty man is running an anti-voter fraud group which ironically calls itself “ Vote Protectors .” In spite of the fact that there is absolutely no evidence of widespread or significant voter fraud, Donald Trump continues to insist that the whole election is “rigged.” 
In his effort to stop the “rigging” of the polls, Stone has asked every Vote Protectors volunteer to wear a specially designed identification badge. Each one is supposed to engage in a fake “exit poll,” asking people who they chose. Election officials believe that these actions would confuse and intimidate voters. 
Of course they would confuse and intimidate voters. That’s why Roger Stone wanted those things done. 
Unfortunately for Stone, however, the Huffington Post got wind of his plan and asked him about it. At first the head of the deplorables refused to explain how he intended to have the group reach its goals. 
So the Huffington Post went online to the site to volunteer. What it found was eye opening, to say the least. The “volunteer” who signed up on the site followed the instructions for generating a very official looking ID badge. It would surely fool many voters if worn by someone taking an “exit poll.” Trump Loyalists Planned Voter Intimidation Using Fake ID Badges, Fake Exit Polling https://t.co/8ojaEGZiD6 
— Cheri DelBrocco (@cdelbrocco) October 26, 2016 
The Huffington Post reports that there was no limit to the number of badges they produced, as you can see above. 
The instructions on the site also told each volunteer that he or she must: “…commit to go out in November and post their YouTube and Periscope streams to the [Vote Protectors] website, organized by state and district, as well as enter actual exit poll survey response.” 
That’s right. Volunteers for Roger Stone’s “Vote Protectors” were supposed to videotape people at the polls and upload them. You can just imagine how this would impact Black or Latino voters. Or, Heaven forbid, voters from Arabic backgrounds. 
When asked specifically about the ID badges, Stone emailed this to the Huffington Post: “I have ordered them taken down. Bad idea, as is video taping. First I have heard of it. I am only interested in a valid, scientifically conducted exit poll.” 
Of course he is. On a “scientifically conducted” exit poll, done by a bunch of volunteer Trumpsters with no training and a profound bias. 
Fabulous. 
That basket of deplorables just keeps getting bigger by the day.

22906,Warren Buffett Says Free Trade Has Turned American Workers Into Roadkill - Breitbart,"Warren Buffett likened American workers who have seen their jobs and factories destroyed by global trade to animals slaughtered by cars and trucks on the highway. [“Nobody should be roadkill,” Buffet said Saturday at the   annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway in Omaha, Nebraska.  The billionaire, who supported Barack Obama and backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, now sounds almost  . His comments on American workers echoed the remarks of President Donald Trump in his inaugural speech in January, which described a landscape of “American carnage” where closed factories are “scattered like tombstones. ” Toward the end of the question and answer session with Buffett and his longtime sidekick Charlie Munger, investor Whitney Tilson asked if businesses should consider the fates of millions of Americans displaced by trade and technology instead of focussing solely on maximizing shareholder value. Buffett argued that free trade was a benefit to the economy at large but that politicians needed to “take care of the people who become roadkill. ” This wasn’t the first time Buffett has used the phrase. Back in February, he    gave this material a test run on CNBC’s Squawkbox. So free trade is wonderful for the world and for the United States, but its benefits are diffused among 320 million people. You buy your bananas cheaper because we don’t try and produce them in the United States. But the penalties from free trade are terrible to specific industries. And as an investor, I can own  —   make a dumb decision on owning a shoe company. But if I own a good insurance company, I can diversify away the problems. If you’re a    steelworker, you can’t diversify away your talents. I mean, you had it if steel or textiles or shoes become subject to total, it all moves offshore. So you want to have free trade, but you also have to take care of the people who, through no fault of their own, have spent their life learning one profession. And you can talk about retraining and all that, but it just isn’t practical. And just take Berkshire Hathaway. We started with 2, 000 employees in New Bedford, Mass, turning out textiles. And that business was doomed. And we had workers there who really they didn’t have alternatives at age 50. Fair number of them just spoke Portuguese. They didn’t have a chance. And a rich country that’s prospering because of free trade, and as the world is prospering, should keep the free trade as much as possible. But they also should take care of the people that become the roadkill, you know, when an industry moves.",0
22908,Exploding E-Cigarette Engulfs Man in Flames on CCTV Footage,"posted by Eddie More evidence has emerged that e-cigarettes can be bad for your health after a French nightclub manager suffered second-degree burns when the vaping device in his pocket dramatically exploded. Terrifying CCTV footage from outside the Toulouse club shows Amine Britel suddenly being engulfed by flames as he chats to fellow smokers. Two men rush to his aid, frantically attempting to put out the fire while Britel leaps about in panic. 

Moments earlier, he could be seen vaping on the e-cigarette before placing it back in his trouser pocket. While the flames were brought under control within a matter of seconds, Britel was left with significant burns to his hand and hip area “I heard what sounded like a firecracker but ten times louder,” he said of the incident which occurred in late October. “After the shock of the explosion, I realized I had caught on fire.” He believes the e-cigarette’s hot battery came into contact with coins in his pocket and the resulting sparks caused the explosion. Though the name of the device’s manufacturer has not been disclosed, Britel confirmed he has reported the incident to the China-based firm. 
The Toulouse case is the latest in a string of serious incidents involving e-cigarettes in recent years. In February 2016 a woman in Bayonne suffered burns when the device she was using suddenly caught fire inside her car. The flames went on to engulf and destroy three other nearby vehicles. In 2014 a man in Merseyside, England died when the e-cigarette charging in his bedroom exploded, igniting the oxygen concentrator he was using. Earlier this year a 19-year-old man working at a California convenience store was treated for burns when the e-cigarette he was carrying in his pocket exploded, propelled itself 15ft (6 meters) into the air and tore his pants to the knee. CCTV footage has also captured the moment a charging e-cigarette exploded right in the face of a barmaid in the UK in 2014.

22913,Obama Just Ordered The Pentagon To Stop Making Vets Repay Bonuses,"Comments 
The Obama administration has ordered the Pentagon to immediately cease demanding the repayment of enlistment bonuse s from some 10,000 National Guardsmen who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service argued that the soldiers were not qualified to receive the money or that accounting errors had resulted in improper payments, despite many of them having served multiple tours. 
Soldiers from California have been badgering their Congressional representatives about this issue for two years , but Congress has done nothing to alleviate the Pentagon’s demands that soldiers repay money they were given years ago and have certainly earned by putting their lives and limbs on the line serving American interests abroad. Some $70 million was spent by overzealous recruiters looking to fill their quotas that the Pentagon is now looking to get back. 
“While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not. About 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments. We’re not going to nickel-and-dime them when they get back, and we’re not going to hold service members responsible unfairly for unethical conduct or fraud perpetrated by someone else” said Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. The Obama Administration is now looking to “fast-track” the investigations, which have been dragging on for years. 
However, the Obama administration is still not bowing to bipartisan pressure from Congress to fully forgive the money. 
In a statement, Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, applauded the move but says more still needs to be done. 
“This is a good step from the Pentagon. But it is long overdue and far from enough. Thousands of lives have been turned upside down and veterans who have served honorably are now in financial ruin through no fault of their own. While it’s good for them to know recouping has been halted, that does not make them financially whole or address their urgent needs. Many will be stuck waiting for clarity and the results of the investigation until next year. The Pentagon needs to do more than just halt the recouping, it needs to pay them back–with interest.” 
The war against Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) is costing the American taxpayer about $11 million a day . The United States military budget is around $600 billion a year , and the Pentagon has “lost track” of some $8 trillion over the past few decades . We can definitely afford to forgive a measly $70 million in order to ensure the financial security of the brave men and women defend our country and our national interests overseas. To hear the Pentagon cry poverty and try to squeeze money out of our National Guardsmen and women after wasting billions of dollars on projects like the defective F-35 joint-strike fighter jet is appalling.",0
22914,"Russian prankster tricks Poroshenko into 1-hour call with fake ""president of Kyrgyzstan""","November 4, 2016 - Fort Russ News -  Olga Kozachenko, PolitNavigator - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has been played by a prankster pretending to be the president of Kyrgyzstan.  
On November 2nd, the official website of the Ukrainian president announced that Poroshenko had held a telephone conversation with the president of Kyrgyzstan.  


Hoewever, the head of the presidential administration and deputy head of its department on Kyrgyzstan, Sapar Isakov, subsequently told Interfax that the information was unreliable and suggested that someone had played the Ukrainian president. 
The day before the alleged conversation took place, Russian prankster Aleksey Stolyarov (known as Lexus), famous for his big pranks played on Ukrainian politicians, wrote on his Facebook: “Are there any specialists on or from Kyrgyzstan here?” 



The famous Ukrainian jurist Andrey Portnov commented on the situation:  
“What turned into nearly an hour long discussion of bilateral relations between the Ukrainian president and the alleged president of Kyrgyzstan should definitely cost the head of the presidential administration his career. This event speaks to the final destruction of the state apparatus and the transformation of its governing institutions into one continuous comedy. Of course, this was made possible thanks to the lustration ongoing in the country, as a result of which a number of inadequate slackers and fools have emerged.”

22915,Notre Dame Students Complain After Mike Pence Announced as Commencement Speaker - Breitbart,"Students at the University of Notre Dame have reacted strongly to the announcement that Vice President Mike Pence will serve as this year’s commencement speaker. [University President John Jenkins announced the decision to host Pence as the speaker at this year’s graduation event in a press release. Jenkins stated that it “is fitting that in the 175th year of our founding on Indiana soil that Notre Dame recognize a native son who served our state and now the nation with quiet earnestness, moral conviction and a dedication to the common good characteristic of true statesmen. ”  Although there have been no calls to disinvite Vice President Pence, students at the University of Notre Dame have been expressing their concern over the decision to offer him the role of commencement speaker. The university’s College Democrats organization expressed their concern over Pence’s stances on immigration, abortion, and healthcare, suggesting that his values contradict those of what the group would consider an appropriate commencement speaker. “Vice President Pence has demonstrated this ‘quiet earnestness’ and ‘moral conviction’ on numerous other occasions: when he refused to allow Syrian refugees, fleeing from violence and terrorism, to find refuge in our state when he limited a woman’s right to control her own body by slashing access to women’s healthcare or when he limited needle exchange programs that could have prevented the worst HIV outbreak Indiana has ever seen,” the College Democrats of Notre Dame wrote in a statement that appeared on their Facebook page. “The new Administration has shown a basic disregard for the fundamental rights of so many communities. We are saddened that Fr. Jenkins would invite Vice President Pence to serve as an ambassador of that Administration, as he receives an honorary degree on a stage shared by members of the very communities he marginalizes,” the statement adds. Senior Film, Television, and Theatre major Elizabeth Hynes expressed her criticism of the decision in a satirical video that she uploaded to YouTube. “Just as many people were opposed to the invitation of President Obama in 2008, I’m opposed to the university inviting Pence today,” Hynes claims. “The invitation of a man who, during his tenure as governor, made decisions that harmed the quality of life for many marginalized groups (e. g. refugees, drug users from lower socioeconomic levels, members of the LGBT community, and women) runs counter to the Catholic values of inclusion that both Pence and our university claim to perpetuate. Additionally, Pence’s complicity in an administration that is hostile towards  —   among many other groups  —   DACA students and their   families makes him a threat to many of our peers’ ways of life. ” Hynes adds that she plans to protest Pence’s commencement address, but claims that she holds no hostilities towards the university. “But I do plan to protest, which won’t invalidate any of the gratitude I feel towards Notre Dame and everyone that commencement weekend celebrates. My parents and this university have taught me to stand up for what I believe is right, so remaining silent would be a betrayal to those lessons. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

22917,Newly discovered emails relating to Hillary Clinton case under review by FBI,"By wmw_admin on October 28, 2016 Ben Jacobs, Sabrina Siddiqui and Spencer Ackerman — The Guardian Oct 28, 2016 
The FBI is investigating newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton’s personal server, its director has announced. 
The FBI had announced in July that its investigation into the Democratic presidential candidate’s private email server had concluded with a recommendation of no criminal charges in the matter, although James Comey, the FBI’s director, criticised Clinton as “careless”. 
But in a letter sent to members of Congress on Friday, Comey said new emails had been discovered in an “unrelated” case. 
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,” Comey wrote. “I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
Comey added: “Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and I cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.” 
“The system might not be as rigged as I thought,” remarked Donald Trump at a rally on Friday afternoon. 
A US security source firmly ruled out that the “unrelated case” Comey referred to in his letter was the investigation into the digital penetration of the Democratic National Committee earlier this year. US intelligence officials have blamed Russia for hacking the DNC and releasing its internal communications online. 
The source, who would not speak on the record, said neither that inquiry nor its adjuncts were related to the new investigative developments related to Clinton. Nor is the recent criminal investigation into a National Security Agency contractor accused of hoarding highly classified intelligence data. 
Later the Associated Press, citing an unnamed official, claimed the newly discovered emails “ did not come from her private server ”. 
The letter from Comey comes 11 days before the presidential election and nearly four months after the FBI director announced the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for what it dubbed “extremely careless” use of a private email server while secretary of state. The FBI director said then: “Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes … our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.” 
It was not immediately clear if Clinton would address the matter publicly. She ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the tarmac about the FBI’s announcement and did not raise the issue after taking the stage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sticking with her routine stump speech.",0
22920,"Life: 5 Pictures For My Amateur Photography Class That Accidentally Captured Shots Of UFOs, But I Am Really Just Looking For Feedback On Composition Here","Email Let’s make sure to keep this a conversation about my photography skills, not a debate on whether or not we’ve been visited by aliens. 1. So really all I’m looking for, feedback-wise, is if I’m grasping the fundamentals of photography on this one. Can we ignore that there’s clearly a UFO of some sort in the sky? I didn’t know it was there, and it wasn’t supposed to be in the picture. I already know the spaceship is there; it’s not constructive for you to tell me again. Do all the lines in the photo draw your eye to the middle? Is there clear depth with the mountains in the distance? Any advice would be great, and again, please ignore the apparent spaceship that, again, was not supposed to be in this photo. 2. In this image, I was trying to frame it correctly for two-point perspective. I think you can pretty much tell that the barn has two vanishing points, and in my opinion, this is pretty good for a newbie. I’d definitely like some tips for the future, though, to make an image like this more interesting to look at other than the fact that there’s what appears to be an intergalactic vessel in the sky above it. 3. I don’t know where the lights in this photo came from, so whether or not they are earthly is completely irrelevant. Personally, I think my camera was just malfunctioning, since I certainly don’t remember them being present while I was taking this; and night photography can be strange with such long exposures, so things can get weird. Okay, now that we’ve discussed the elephant in the room, let’s talk about symmetry in this image since that’s what I was going for. Any thoughts? 4. If one more person tells me that I’ve taken the most important photo in human history and doesn’t have any input on if there is too much headroom above the mountains or if I used a long enough lens, I am going to scream. 5. Okay, I admit that the UFO is what really drew me into composing this image. That being said, let’s talk about how it fits into the photograph, not the fact that I actually captured it. Is it a good picture? Possibly. Did I use the rule of thirds successfully? I sure hope so. Is it proof that we aren’t alone in the universe? Well, one amateur’s photo isn’t going to prove or disprove that.",0
22921,WATCH As Chris Cuomo Tells Rudy Giuliani: You Live In Fact-Free ‘Trumpland’,"WATCH As Chris Cuomo Tells Rudy Giuliani: You Live In Fact-Free ‘Trumpland’ By Andrew Bradford   
There was a battle royale this morning on CNN, and when it was over with, host Chris Cuomo made sure Rudy Giuliani was reduced to rubble. 
The interview began with Cuomo telling the former New York City mayor that he didn’t smile very much at last week’s Al Smith charity dinner when Hillary Clinton took a few comedic jabs at him: “You looked like Grumpy Cat.” 
Sullen and sour, Giuliani said Clinton should be in prison and wearing an orange jumpsuit. But when Rudy began trying to filibuster, Cuomo interrupted him and said he while he might not agree with the decision the FBI made to not charge Clinton with any wrongdoing when it came to her email server, Giuliani wasn’t entitled to make things up: 
Next, Giuliani began ranting about some “bribe” that predated the email controversy, and that was when Cuomo shut him down with one line : “My entire life because you’re so accurate and all of a sudden, you’re in Trumpland and the facts are all over the place.” 
As if he hadn’t been embarrassed enough, Giuliani then attempted to start talking about the recent announcement that Obamacare premiums will rise by as much as 25 percent in 2017: “As a result, because the Democrats forced this down the Republicans’ throat, the ACA, they decided to punish them. And they won’t work with the Democrats to fix any of the problems that they could fix.” 
Cuomo was ready for that line, too, and again lit into his guest : “Oh, that’s a bunch of nonsense. They created it themselves. They cut out bipartisan support.” 
When it was over with, you could tell by the look on Rudy’s face that he knew he had just been bested. Maybe Trump should rethink letting the unhinged Giuliani be one of his main surrogates. He really stinks at it. 
Here’s both parts of the interview:

22928,Russia And Syria Blamed For Idlib Bombing Hoax,"Speaking at the Valdai International Discussion Club in Sochi on Thursday, Putin said Russian patience has limits. “We(‘ve) show(n) restraint so far and (haven’t) respond(ed) to our partners (sic) in the same gauche manner, but everything has its limits. We can do it,” he explained. So what is he waiting for, given endless US provocations, refusing mutual cooperation on vital issues, rejecting normal relations, heading inevitably for war unless challenged and stopped. He’s not stupid or uninformed. Russia’s intelligence capability likely matches America’s, so he knows what it’s up to in Eastern Europe, Syria, elsewhere in the Middle East, along with virtually everywhere else. Pretending both countries are “partners” defies logic. Thinking mutual cooperation with Washington is possible one day is like waiting for Godot. And things may get exponentially worse once Hillary succeeds Obama, a virtual certainty at this point by fair or foul means – likely the latter, election theft a longstanding US tradition, showing democracy in America is pure fantasy. On Thursday, screaming deceptive Western headlines outrageously blamed Russia and Syria for bombing a Syrian school in Idlib province. It was a hoax. No bombing occurred. US-supported terrorists attacked the school, killing at least six children, injuring many others. An exclusive RT International investigation determined that “a gas canister and a mine landed in a classroom in Hadaiq al-Andalus” – projectiles launched from terrorist-controlled eastern Aleppo. Yet media scoundrels irresponsibly blamed Russia and Syria – while ignoring daily eastern Aleppo shelling, US supported terrorists killing and injuring civilians in government controlled parts of the city. Long before Internet access to important information from reliable independent sources, famed humorist/social commentator Will Rogers once said: “All I know is just what I read in the papers, and that’s an alibi for my ignorance.” Reporting then was deplorable. Today it’s beyond the pale. It’s hard imagining why anyone wastes time and money on pure rubbish – or believes television news is credible. Media misinformation proliferates. Readers, viewers and listeners are systematically lied to. Daily fare isn’t fit to print or broadcast. Mainstream editors, reporters and commentators are a virtual Noah’s Ark of scam artists. On Thursday, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov called video footage of the Idlib incident shown on Western television fake – “more than ten edited fragments assembled together,” he explained. No Russian or Syrian warplanes were in the area when the attack occurred. No bomb craters existed. Damage to the school was inconsistent to a bombing. Only one wall was damaged, not the ceiling, desks or chairs. Had a bombing occurred, the blast would have destroyed or severely damaged the building. Furniture inside would have been “swept away.” “As one can see on a photo from the Russian drone, the roof of the school is not damaged and there are no bomb craters in the area adjacent to the school,” Konashenkov explained. A US drone in the area at the time of the attack has the same footage. Yet Washington concealed what should have been revealed straightaway to set the record straight. “UNICEF leadership fell…victim to a new deception of swindlers and (Al Qaeda-affiliated) White Helmets,” said Konashenkov. Washington perhaps orchestrated what happened, part of its sinister anti-Russia/anti-Syria agenda. Submit your review",0

Communists from the “ Red Guards Austin ” were arrested after violently attacking Trump supporters during an anti-Trump rally at the Capitol on Sunday night, as reported at a local CBS affiliate . 
Trevor Loudon is well aware of the violent and “secretive” Red Guards Austin, who he describes as “extreme Maoist.” This communist group, Loudon explains, is “aligned with the Red Guards Los Angeles and the Kansas City Missouri-based Progressive Youth Organization , both of which were heavily involved in anti-Trump protests before the election.” 
Referring to the arrests, the Red Guards Austin posted the following on Facebook using the code name “Puka” for one of those arrested: 
A brief perusal of Red Guards Austin Facebook page reveals that this anti-capitalist group is not interested in peace. Advertising an anti-Trump rally last Thursday, they wrote : 
“Calling all militants. F— the police. Show up if your pissed at this system and lets shut s— down.” 
The communist group shared an event for students from the “ Revolutionary Student Front ” (which describes itself as a “revolutionary anti-capitalist student movement” ) scheduled for this Friday night called “‘Not My President’ to ‘No More Presidents!'” which seeks to build “a movement that can create a revolution to end capitalism will burn the oppressive roots from which fascism grows:” 
“With Donald Trump as president-elect, a lot of us are wondering how we got here and what we can do about it. The Democratic Party won’t save us; even ‘progressives’ like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said they’ll work together with President Trump. Peaceful protest won’t save us ; as Stokely Carmichael said, “Nonviolence only works if your opponent has a conscience. The United States has none.” 
The only thing that has stopped fascism historically is an organized anti-fascist fighting force; Hitler was only stopped by the Red Army. The rising wave of fascist movements emboldened by Trump’s presidency can only be countered by an even more bold mass movement of anti-capitalist resistance. Now more than ever, the steps necessary for building this type of mass revolutionary movement need to be made. And only a movement that can create a revolution to end capitalism will burn the oppressive roots from which fascism grows. 
Join the Revolutionary Student Front at Jester A203A (tentative) on 6:30 on Thursday, to talk about the concrete steps necessary in building power on campus as working-class students to create a better world and defend each other from the threat of fascism.” 
The Revolutionary Student Front supports the Red Guards Austin, according to this post: Red Guard Austin are friends with the Revolutionary Student Front – Austin 
The Red Guard Austin’s cover photo on Facebook: Red Guards Austin Facebook photo 
The Revolutionarfy Student Front gives tips to protesters who are “new to protests that are more on the disruptive and confrontational side,” such as writing the phone number of the National Lawyers Guild on the protester’s arm before the protest. Not surprisingly, the communist agitators do not discourage violence. 
Watch a local CBS affiliate report (mildly) on the arrest: 
The same communist organization attacked Alex Jones during a pro-life rally in May, 2015. 
Watch the video here: 
It is highly unusual for a local news report to identify “activists” as members of communist groups, although the majority (if not all) of the recent anti-Trump protests are indeed organized by communists.

22938,Huffington Post Continues Campaigning for Hillary Clinton,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161109183253/http://www.huffingtonpost.com They pretend Trump’s win is a victory for bigots, instead of a defeat for the aristocracy (‘Wall Street’, ‘The Establishment’, or America’s billionaires and their agents such as lobbyists and the leading politicians). However, a close look at the evidence shows Huffington Post to be wrong: Trump’s win was overwhelmingly driven by Americans’ repudiation of the aristocracy itself (such as, for example, repudiation of the Institute that runs Huffington Post’s neoconservative international edition, World Post , the Berggruen Institute (including Eric Schmidt , Lawrence Summers , Fareed Zakaria , Arianna Huffington, Nicholas Berggruen , Ernesto Zedillo , Carl Bildt, Niall Ferguson, and Joseph Nye , all being proponents of Obama’s building war against Russia — such as : “To confront Putin, Europe will have to make changes that will be deeply controversial on a continent long committed to environmentalism and marked by an aversion to the use of force”). And, as far as global warming is concerned, which is a real problem about Trump, it’s also very much and demonstrably — not merely in words — a real problem about Hillary too (and one that outside the context of the Presidential campaign has even been courageously reported by some of HuffPo’s own reporters ), but HuffPo and other Democratic Party propagandists pretend there’s reason to believe that Trump’s actions would be even worse than hers have been, and HuffPo’s readers thus end up being little else than Democratic Party suckers who feel satisfied in their ‘news’ reading to soak up what is almost entirely Democratic Party propaganda, which means the propaganda emanating out of the White House whenever a Democrat resides there — sort of like a Democratic Party version of the Republican Party’s Fox ‘News’. The aristocracy ( all of it, both its Republican and its Democratic Party branches) continue their campaign, and expect to crush their opposition — the public (of all parties). And that’s what a close look at the evidence shows explains Trump’s win — not bigotry on the part of the American public. Bigotry is a huge problem in every society, but especially amongst the aristocracy, who love to pretend that it’s mainly a problem ‘down below’ — so that they can continue to exploit the public while claiming to be superior to it. That’s the Big Lie, which Obama and the Clintons — and Huffington Post — promote and get paid very well to promote. Their campaign never ends. Only the personnel do.",0
22940,Philly Archbishop: Abortion Is ‘Subtle Genocide Posing as Rights’,"“The humanity of the unborn child is obvious on any ultrasound machine,” writes Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput in an invigorating new book. [A redoubtable evangelizer and culture warrior, Chaput lays out a road map for living the Christian faith in a   world in his new work Strangers in a Strange Land, due for release on February 21.  Though the Archbishop deals with a multitude of topics from the decay of modern democracies to millennials’ dread of commitment, his words on abortion ring with particular force on a day when tens of thousands march on Washington DC in defense of the right to life. Chaput notes that important strides have been made in the past half century and that today “many American young people are more committedly   than their parents and even their grandparents. ” “This seems ironic, but it shouldn’t surprise,” he observes. “They’ve seen what abortion does. They’ve lived with the fact that they could have been aborted. The humanity of the unborn child is obvious on any ultrasound machine. ” Still, Chaput argues, a fear of living “outside the cone of public approval” leads many to shirk their personal responsibility for changing society. In the case of abortion, “many of us are happy to live with   and ambiguity rather than risk being cut out of the herd. The culture of lies thrives on our own complicity, lack of courage, and   deception. ” The Archbishop also assails “chronic newsroom prejudice” in the shaping of certain kinds of news, especially in the abortion debate, as evidenced by the wildly imbalanced coverage of the   Women’s March on Washington this week as compared with the annual March for Life. Thus, “Planned Parenthood is assumed good, while critics who secretly film its cynicism, profiteering, and barbarism are assumed bad,” he notes. Meanwhile, “the language of ‘abortion rights,’ common in most newsrooms, has the familiar Orwellian ring of avoiding an unpleasant reality (killing a child in utero) by calling it something else,” he notes. “Thus does the magic of words rework the sinews of the universe. ” The Archbishop reserves some choice expressions to summarize the last eight years under the Obama administration. “The White House elected to power in November 2008 campaigned on compelling promises of hope, change, and bringing the nation together,” he said. “The reality it delivered for eight years was rather different: a brand of leadership that was narcissistic, aggressively secular, ideologically divisive, resistant to compromise, unwilling to accept responsibility for its failures, and generous in spreading blame. ” Nowhere was the aggressively secular agenda more evident than in the matter of abortion and religious freedom. “The same intolerance marked the administration’s fight to coerce abortion and contraceptive services as part of national health care,” Chaput contends. “It tenaciously refused reasonable compromise on exemptions for religiously affiliated providers and organizations and deliberately sought to break any opposition —   prompting a sardonic Wall Street Journal editorial renaming the Little Sisters of the Poor ‘the Little Sisters of the Government. ’” And thus, we live in an age “when almost every scientific advance seems to be matched by some new cruelty in our entertainment, cynicism in our politics, ignorance of the past, consumer greed, subtle genocides posing as rights like the cult of abortion, and a basic confusion about what —  if anything distinctive at all —  it means to be human,” he argues. Fortunately, the book deals not only with diagnosing our diseases but also in prescribing remedies for them —  mostly in the form of more authentic engagement with the deeper truths of human existence and a bracing evangelism capable of rendering the Christian message winsome and liberating in a world jaded by disbelief.

22944,Man Injured in Central Park Explosion - The New York Times,"With a bright sun and an easy breeze, the morning had the makings of a perfect Sunday in Central Park for strolling visitors. Then, around 11 a. m. an explosion interrupted the quiet. Officials said a young man walking in the southeastern end of the park stepped on what turned out to be explosive material that had been left behind. Investigators believe it was part of an “experiment with fireworks,” police officials said, and declined to call the material a device. The police said they do not believe it was connected to terrorism. “It is not unusual for the public to make or try to create homemade fireworks around the Fourth of July,” said John O’Connell, a deputy police chief for counterterrorism with the New York Police Department. Soon after the blast, social media posts circulated describing a grisly scene, the victim bloodied and maimed. And there was a rush of journalists and police officers who, coincidentally, were already nearby for the funeral services of Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize winner. Even President Obama was briefed about the explosion. The jolt escalated quickly from there as some news organizations reported that the authorities were shutting down Central Park, a colossal undertaking  —   clearing out the   park  —   that would have indicated something worse than an accident involving fireworks had taken place. Those reports were quickly dismissed by police officials as erroneous, but still, fear and anxiety had been stirred around the park. “We are worried,” Giselle Brown, 42, said as she sat on a bench on Fifth Avenue with relatives visiting from Nicaragua. “We want to know exactly what happened. ” After the explosion, the man  —   Connor Golden, who was visiting from Fairfax, Va.  —   was lying against a boulder with his left leg below the calf severely wounded. Someone had tied a strip of blue fabric around his leg as a tourniquet before emergency workers carried him from the park on a stretcher. The authorities said Mr. Golden was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, where he was in serious but stable condition. He was undergoing surgery, officials said on Sunday evening. They added that they believe Mr. Golden, who was with two friends at the time, had stumbled upon the material. “We don’t know what happened,” one of the friends, Thomas Hinds, told reporters near the scene. “There was a small explosion. And then dust. ” Lt. Mark Torre, the commander of the Police Department’s bomb squad, said he believed the man had encountered homemade fireworks that did not appear to be designed to explode from contact. “Their goal is to make a loud noise,” Lieutenant Torre said, “maybe make a flash. ” The material, he said, could have been left behind days ago. Later on Sunday, a swath of the park, starting from East 61st Street and heading a few blocks north, remained cordoned off as investigators from the Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were still at work. Mohammad Matin, 58, left his cart selling ice cream, pretzels, soda and churros when the police told him to leave the area. He went home to Jackson Heights, Queens, leaving the cart unattended for hours. “I was really upset,” Mr. Matin said. “Today is Sunday, a very big day for business. I lost my business. ” Abdul Abdul, 29, heard something while working at a halal food stand outside the park. “I thought a tire had popped,” Mr. Abdul said. But he was stunned to hear what had happened. “Oh my God,” said Mr. Abdul, who has worked at the stand for about a year and a half. “I have never seen anything happen in Central Park before. ”",0

22947,"Washington Metro System Failed to Learn From Accidents, Report Finds - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The capital region’s subway system has failed to adequately learn from a series of dangerous and sometimes fatal episodes in recent years, making “little or no progress” toward instituting a culture of safety, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded on Tuesday. The assessment came as the board discussed the findings of a more than yearlong investigation into a fatal instance of smoke filling a tunnel in January 2015. Its conclusion painted the most complete picture to date of the how the aging infrastructure, flawed safety response and inadequate local and federal oversight combined to cause the event, which killed one person and injured 91 others. But the investigation also allowed the board members to express concerns about how the nation’s second busiest subway system has acted  —   or not acted  —   to address prominent safety lapses. “When the N. T. S. B. finds itself issuing a continuous stream of accident reports to address the basic safety management of a single transit rail system, something is fundamentally flawed,” Christopher A. Hart, the board’s chairman, said. “Here, that something is safety oversight. ” The report came as the newly installed managers of the transit agency, known here as Metro, grapple with several   setbacks and continuing funding woes facing the system. The N. T. S. B. members acknowledged that Metro, under that leadership, appeared now to be taking steps in the right direction and offered more than 30 recommendations to the authorities involved in the incident, primarily involving maintenance and safety training. They also renewed their criticism of the Federal Transit Administration, which has overseen the system’s safety since October, arguing that it does not have the ability, the experience or the disciplinary authority to do its job adequately. Instead, Mr. Hart and other board members said, Metro should be reclassified as a commuter rail system and its oversight moved to the   Federal Railroad Administration until authorities here conclude their   efforts to create a federally approved local safety oversight body. That suggestion prompted a response after the meeting from Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, who defended the F. T. A. in a letter released to the board and said it should continue its oversight of Metro. Though many of the investigation’s findings were forecast in a preliminary report in the days after the smoke event and during investigative hearings last June, the final report gave a    account of what went wrong and who was to blame. Investigators concluded that the Jan. 12, 2015, episode was caused by “a prolonged short circuit that consumed power system components” that had been allowed to lapse under “ineffective inspection and maintenance practices. ” Water that contaminated the faulted cable, a dearth of smoke detectors in Metro’s tunnels, ventilation fans that did not work properly, and staff that was not trained in how to use them exacerbated the problem, the N. T. S. B. said. The board also said that city fire and emergency services were not prepared to respond to such an event. “Whatever could go wrong that afternoon did go wrong,” Robert L. Sumwalt, a member of the board, said, while questioning N. T. S. B. investigators. “To quote a Shakespearean play, it was a comedy of errors. Except, it was not funny. ” N. T. S. B. members made frequent comparisons to conclusions reached in a similar investigation after a 2009 train collision that killed nine people near the city’s outskirts. Top Metro officials attended Tuesday’s meeting. Paul J. Wiedefeld, its new general manager, is expected to announce a systemwide maintenance plan in the coming weeks. And on Monday, in advance of the safety board’s report, Metro took steps to address at least one of its concerns, announcing that it would station a fire department official at its operations control center at all times to help coordinate emergency responses.",0
22948,WikiLeaks: Email Proves Democrats Manipulate Polls,"Email 

An email published by WikiLeaks on Friday reveals the extent to which Democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends. 
The 2008 email appears shows Democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results. 
“FYI: We are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll. Sample too small otherwise,” operative Tom Matzzie wrote to Clinton adviser Paul Begala, campaign Chairman John Podesta, Media Matters for America founder David Brock, and operative Susan McCue. “Good,” Begala responded. 
Trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant Hillary lead over Trump have been manipulated through selective sampling. There is ample evidence that this occurs in Democrat-friendly newsrooms. 
“Hillary Clinton has opened up a 7-point lead over Donald Trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a ‘bounce’ for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the Democratic nomination last week,” the Daily Mail reported in June. 
""But the weekly tracking poll, from NBC News and the Surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 percent more self-identified Democrats than Republicans – the same margin as the poll's topline result,"" the article noted. 
The email released by WikiLeaks Friday proves that Democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics. 
Polls are a powerful propaganda tool, and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidate's loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on Election Day. 
""I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout,"" Rand Paul said in an interview on Wednesday on ""The Tom Roten Show"" out of West Virginia. ""When we say over and over someone can't win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout,"" he added.",0

Trump fans may have won the election, but they aren’t taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of Michelle Obama. The Donald’s Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue. 
“I could have spent eight years doing anything , and at some level, it would have been fine,” Obama told the magazine . “I could have focused on flowers. I could have focused on decor. I could have focused on entertainment. Because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. There’s no legislative authority; you’re not elected. And that’s a wonderful gift of freedom.” 
In exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans — and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate. The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an “ape” and a “monkey” and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes. 
If you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong. Trump fans are not done by a long shot — and now they have been emboldened by America electing its first official KKK candidate. 
It will get worse before it gets better.

22955,Bernie Sanders to California Democrats: Please Pass Single-Payer Health Care! - Breitbart,"Former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders had a message for California’s Democrats on Saturday: “Please lead the country and pass the   bill. ”[Sanders was speaking in Beverly Hills, according to the Sacramento Bee, where he was accepting an award from Consumer Watchdog, a   organization devoted to consumer advocacy.  Democrats, who hold a   majority in the state legislature that allows them to pass bills virtually at will, are currently considering a “ ” health care system, also called “socialized medicine,” in which the state would cover the cost of health insurance and health care for everybody in California. The “Healthy California Act,” SB 562, promises: “to guarantee that every resident of California will receive comprehensive healthcare services. It’s like Medicare for All. ” The legislation took a step towards passage late last month with a hearing in the State Senate. The Senate Health Committee voted   to approve the bill, which will now continue its circuitous pass through the State Senate before proceeding to a final vote. Town halls and rallies have been staged across the state to support the legislation, which has the backing of the powerful California nursing unions. However, Governor Jerry Brown is opposed to the idea, which he said in March was too costly. “Where do you get the extra money? This is the whole question,” he told the Los Angeles Times. Sanders’s home state of Vermont recently tried to implement a   system  —   and failed. Sanders was evidently undeterred by the experience. “The great state of California can send a message that will be heard all over this country, and all over the world if you pass   here,” he said on Saturday.

22957,"PHOTOS: German Carnival Floats Depict Decapitated Trump, Hitler Comparisons","German cities held their annual Rose Monday float parades today, with many mocking U. S. President Donald Trump, Brexit, and European populist leaders. [The carnival celebrations in Germany are one of the biggest holidays of the year and a part of the celebrations are a float parade on Rosenmontag or Rose Monday.  From Cologne to Dusseldorf the major theme of the float parades this year was U. S. President Trump, whom they depicted performing sex acts with the Statue of Liberty, and being decapitated by a guillotine. In Dusseldorf, President Trump was shown performing a sex act on the statue of liberty, a criticism by the satirist that he was “screwing liberty” because of his travel ban against countries know to either sponsor terrorism or harbour large radical Islamic extremist elements. Another float in the parade showed the Statue of Liberty with the severed head of the President with “America Resist!” painted on her chest. The float was likely referencing the controversial cover of German magazine Der Spiegel in which Trump was portrayed cutting off the head of the statue in an Islamic   execution. Trump was joined by Front National French leader Marine le Pen, and Dutch firebrand leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV) Geert Wilders in a float that compared the trio to a blonde Adolf Hitler. The float read “blonde is the new brown”. In Cologne, the violent imagery toward the U. S. President was also on display. President Trump’s severed head was shown on one float hung from a guillotine. Trump was not the only focus of the West German satirists. British Prime Minister Theresa May was shown on one Dusseldorf float putting a pistol in her own mouth which said “Brexit” on the side. The Polish government, which has had strained relations with the government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the past year, is shown as a pig eating sausages labelled “democracy” and defecating “dictatorship. ” In January, head of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) Jaroslaw Kaczynski said Merkel bore some responsibility for negative coverage of Poland by German media. The German   migration party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) were not spared either. A float claiming to show an AfD supporter showed a fat man with an   badge, and AfD badge and a Lügenpresse, or “lying press” badge. The party has seen gains in recent regional elections and is currently the third largest behind Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) led by former European Union Parliament President Martin Schulz.

22960,WikiLeaks Report: Obama Admin Discriminated Against Christians for Top Jobs In Favor of Muslims,"WikiLeaks Report: Obama Admin Discriminated Against Christians for Top Jobs In Favor of Muslims Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
In a bombshell email from September 2008 , advisers to Barack Obama’s presidential campaign consciously decided to choose Arab Muslims over Arab Christians in suggesting top staff positions should Obama win the White House. The email was released by WikiLeaks in its latest series, “The Podesta Emails.” 
Former New York Solicitor General Preeta D. Bansal sent the email to Michael Froman, a classmate of Obama’s at Harvard and a member of the 12-person advisory board for the Obama campaign’s transition team. The email came with “the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American candidates for top Administration jobs, sub-cabinet jobs, and outside boards/agencies/policy committees.” 
The key reveal comes in this passage: 
In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp. Christian). 
This suggests the Obama campaign’s transition team aimed to hire Muslims over Christians, or at the very least that in the interests of diversity, the team was willing to give preferential treatment to Muslim Arabs rather than Christian Arabs. The emphasis on adherence to Islam is significant, given other troubling aspects of the Obama administration. 
Of the Syrian refugees admitted to the United States in September 2016, 98.9 percent were Muslim (1825 refugees), as compared to only 1.1 percent non-Muslim (22 refugees). Over the whole year, non-Muslim Syrian refugee admissions account for less than one percent (0.8) overall, with 11,818 Muslims and only 95 non-Muslims. 
According to The Gulf/2000 Project at Columbia University, the religious breakdown of the Syrian population from 2008-2009 shows that non-Muslims made up a great deal more

22961,Hundreds of Armed Police Descend On Water Protectors Trying To Reach DAPL Site,"Videos Hundreds of Armed Police Descend On Water Protectors Trying To Reach DAPL Site Amidst the standoff one peaceful demonstrator said she was telling officers that she ""Loved them"" when they began shooting her in the face with mace. | November 3, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! 
Police descended on water protectors in North Dakota on Wednesday, as images on social media showed a dramatic standoff along a creek that borders a construction site for the long-opposed Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) . 
Jordan Chariton, a political reporter with The Young Turks network, posted this video dispatch after covering events just east of the main camp, where Standing Rock Sioux tribal members and their allies were set upon by law enforcement officers in full military gear: 
Amidst the standoff one peaceful demonstrator said she was telling officers that she “Loved them” when they began shooting her in the face with mace. 
And filmmaker and journalist Josh Fox, also on the scene, decried the violence by authorities, telling Chariton, “These people from the North Dakota police force and the United States government has lost legitimacy in every respect today.” 
According to independent media outlet Unicorn Riot , which was also on the ground in the town of Cannon Ball, hundreds of water protectors attempted to cross footbridges built over Cantapeta Creek to reach the DAPL construction area on the other shore, but the police in riot gear reportedly pulled the bridges apart and forcibly kept people from crossing onto the opposite bank. 
One protector said the walkways had been built to help elders reach the construction area to pray for sacred sites. 
The Bismarck Tribune writes that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which lays claim to the land along the shoreline, gave Morton County the orders to arrest protesters and break down the bridge. 
According to Grand Forks Herald , law enforcement officers used a boat to pull the bridge apart, and many protectors proceeded to swim across the river. 
People on the ground said women and children were being evacuated from the protest camps, multiple people had already been maced, and police had fired rubber bullets, injuring at least one person. 
Native American tribes and activists from all over the country have been resisting DAPL’s construction for months, saying it threatens their access to clean water and violates treaty rights.

22965,Is it possible that Saudi King be tried in US courts by JASTA Law?,"Email 

According to the JASTA law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments’ harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks, it is so likely that Saudi king be tried. According to experts, the passing of JASTA may cause international chaos. Especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute US officials if US do so. 
Is it possible that Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz being tried for potential liability in events of September 11? The trial is possible by the legislation of Jasta. By Jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations. 
In late September, United States Congress ignored President Obama’s advice and his veto and passed JASTA law, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. This law made US-Saudi relation more chaotic. 
US confederate states expressed concern to JASTA legislation 
Not just Saudi Arabia expressed concerns to JASTA, US confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the US quasi-sacred treaty with Saudi Arabia and asked for appealing. France and the Netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against USA and its military and diplomacy allies. 
John Kerry, United States Secretary of State, showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk. A few days ago Kerry and Adel al-Jubeir discussed about the ramifications of JASTA and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of US interests. He said: “there are ways to fix the problem.” While experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of America in complaining by circumvent the law. 
Even Saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system. 
According to Hussein ibish, an expert on the Persian Gulf littoral states, JASTA will cause chaos at the international level. 
Last September, European Union warned: “Other countries may also want to pass similar legislation and discuss impunity. This threat was an addition written letters to US government. 
Also France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom representatives discussed about the feedback of this law. The Gulf littoral states, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan and Japan Protested against JASTA. 
The Saudi-US Relations in danger of Jasta 
Bernard Haykel, Princeton University Professor, said: “If Saudi king does not appear in New York court to be interrogated, warrant will be issued against Saudi Arabia.” Riyadh and Washington relations declined over the past three years especially with Obama's policies on Syria.” JASTA shows Saudi ruling that Obama turned his back to its allies in the Middle East,” he added. 
Riyadh strictly denies his involvement in 9/11, While 15 of the 19 were from Saudi Arabia. Turki al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, also comments:” America wants to invade his most loyal friend over the past 70 years.” 
Jasta law does not refer to Saudi Arabia. It would allow families of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks to sue the perpetrators of the attack.",0
22966,Trump says he’d be ‘neutral’ with Israelis and Palestinians,"Email 
Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: ‘Sometimes agreements can’t be made’After being asked by a voter at a Charleston, South Carolina, town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict, the GOP contender vowed to give it “one hell of a shot” and called it “probably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.”But when pressed by host Joe Scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord, Trump declined to take sides. 
“You know, I don’t want to get into it, because … If I win, I don’t want to be in a position where I’m saying to you and the other side now says, ‘We don’t want Trump involved,'” Trump said. 
“Let me be sort of a neutral guy,” he continued. “A lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don’t want to say whose fault is it. I don’t think it helps.”Trump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. 
“It’s possible it’s not makeable, because don’t forget it has to last — it’s wonderful to make it and it doesn’t work, but it has to last,” he said. “To make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but I’m going to give it a shot.” 
Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. 
“A lot of people say an agreement can’t be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements can’t be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,” he said. “I was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it’s impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time they’re children to hate Jewish people.”In the past, Trump has questioned Israel’s commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “a good friend.” 
At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, “I don’t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don’t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.” 
He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: “A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal — whether or not Israel’s willing to sacrifice certain things,” he said. “They may not be, and I understand that, and I’m okay with that. But then you’re just not going to have a deal.” 
Trump’s comments Wednesday came hours after a dramatic upset in polls saw Trump fall behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the first time in 31 consecutive polls, coming in at 26% of registered Republican voters nationally, two points behind Cruz at 28%.",0

22971,"83-Year-Old Farmer Who Shot Burglar in the Foot Forced to Pay £30,000 Legal Fees","A fund has been set up to help an    farmer forced to spend £30, 000 to fund his own defence after he was prosecuted for shooting a convicted burglar in the foot when he intruded on his isolated Yorkshire farm. [Kenneth Hugill, who uses a walking stick and a hearing aid, wept with relief after it took a jury at Hull Crown Court just 24 minutes to acquit him of grievous bodily harm.  Despite being cleared of wrongdoing, the octogenarian farmer was left with a legal bill of at least £30, 000 for the   trial. The family has said they will have to borrow the money and pay it back over decades. Mr. Hugill said he fired an antiquated shotgun in the dark towards a vehicle as it revved its engine and began driving towards him, explaining in court that he had never intended to hurt anyone. Outside court, the pensioner wiped away tears as he said: “I am very, very pleased  —   it’s marvellous. I thought I should not have been prosecuted right from the start. I don’t shock easily. I didn’t feel it was justified. “The court ordeal has not affect[ed] me much, but it was more my wife and daughter in law. I pulled the trigger because I thought the car was going to kill me. ” While the    farmer, who has had two hip replacements and a   operation, was arrested, fingerprinted, and forced to fund his own £30, 000 defence, police took no further action against the two intruders who were questioned on suspicion of attempted diesel theft and poaching. Lawyer Nick Freeman felt so strongly about the case he set up a crowdfunding page, on which he brands the legal system a “disgrace”. He writes that Mr. Hugill “never should have been prosecuted”. “I’m sure there are plenty of people who felt as equally incensed as I did after reading about the case, and will be happy to spare a few pounds in helping this   family in their hour of financial need. ” Noting that “people break into other people’s homes [and] cause fear and misery” North Thanet MP Sir Roger Hale said the case is another example of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) treating criminals as though they were ‘victims’. “Given the circumstances, perhaps the CPS will now think twice about doing this again. It’s quite simple: people should have the right to defend their own property,” he said. “The jury in this case clearly heard the evidence and thought the old boy was quite right to defend his own property. If you don’t want to come to harm, don’t break into somebody’s else’s home or trespass on their land. “We need to have a sense of proportion about this. The people who the CPS sometimes like to present as a victim is sometimes the criminal. ” Gerry Wareham, Chief Crown Prosecutor, said it was in the public interest to prosecute Mr. Hugill. He said: “We considered all the evidence in this case extremely carefully, and took full account of the situation Mr Hugill found himself in that evening. “We are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to put the matter before a court and that it was in the public interest to do so. ” Back to work and ploughing his fields ready to sow wheat on Tuesday, Mr. Hugill thanked supporters and said he hopes to get his guns and ammunition back after they were seized by police so he can get back to shooting rabbits on the farm. “I have been shooting since I was less than 12 years old, and it has been part of my life on the farm,” he told MailOnline. “I’m glad to get back to work and put the last 16 months behind me. Farming has been my life. ”  ",0

22976,U.N. Drops Wonder Woman as an Ambassador - The New York Times,"The United Nations has ended a campaign featuring Wonder Woman as an ambassador for women and girls, two months after the announcement was met with protests and a petition complaining that the fictional superhero was an inappropriate choice to represent female empowerment. In announcing the campaign in October, the United Nations said it was “about women and girls everywhere, who are wonder women in their own right, and the men and boys who support their struggle for gender equality. ” But not everyone saw it that way. Nearly 45, 000 people signed a petition protesting the selection. “A   white woman of impossible proportions, scantily clad in a shimmery,   body suit with an American flag motif and   boots” is not an appropriate spokeswoman for gender equity at the United Nations, the petition said. Jeffrey Brez, a spokesman for the U. N. disputed that the campaign had ended early or as a result of the protest, as some reports have suggested, citing other honorary ambassadorships with much shorter tenures. The “Angry Birds” character Red spent one day in May as an honorary ambassador for climate issues, he said. “Some people voiced a concern that they didn’t feel it was appropriate for a fictional character to be representing women and girls,” Mr. Brez said on Tuesday. In response to those complaints, he said, the organization had tried to emphasize “the   wonder women,   women and girls” who would be affected by the campaign, which was meant to promote gender equity worldwide as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Wonder Woman’s ambassadorship began with great fanfare with an event in October that featured the actresses Lynda Carter and Gal Gadot, who have both portrayed the character on the big and small screens. (The announcement, and the objections to it, came weeks after the United Nations rejected seven female candidates to be its next   before choosing a man, António Guterres.) A spokeswoman for DC Entertainment, in whose comics Wonder Woman first appeared in 1941, said the company has been “extremely pleased” with the partnership. “Wonder Woman stands for peace, justice and equality, and for 75 years she has been a motivating force for many and will continue to be long after the conclusion of her U. N. honorary ambassadorship,” the spokeswoman, Courtney Simmons, said via email. Wonder Woman’s ambassadorship officially ends on Friday.",0

British banker Rurik Jutting took up to 60 grams of cocaine while torturing and killing a prostitute, a Hong Kong court has heard. He is also alleged to have harbored fantasies of returning to the UK to kidnap and abuse teenage girls. 
The 30-year-old is on trial for the murder of two Indonesian women in his flat in the former British colony and finance hub. 
In a video seen by authorities, Jutting is heard bragging about the massive amount of cocaine he had taken over the course of the three-day torture of his first victim, 23-year-old Sumarti Ningsih. 
He told police he derived a “ sense of enjoyment he never had before ” from his actions and knew then that he would kill again.

Jutting, formerly a banker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who studied at the University of Cambridge, has denied murder but admitted to manslaughter. 
He was arrested in 2014 after the bodies of Ningsih and a second Indonesian woman, 26-year-old Seneng Mujiasih, were found in his apartment. 
Interview tapes played in the courtroom reveal some of Jutting’s thought processes during the killings. 
“ She was unlucky to be the person in my flat when I realized that physically hurting someone when under cocaine was something I gained satisfaction from, ” he said of his first victim. 
Medical experts told the court that Jutting appeared to have built up a huge tolerance to cocaine and existed on a daily dose of wine, cocaine and Red Bull. 
He also revealed his plans to return to the UK and abduct schoolgirls from an expensive boarding school in Buckinghamshire. 
“ They would be, say, 15 years old and I would basically turn these three girls into my sex slaves, it would be good to psychologically play them off against each other, ” he told police.

WITH the first of four planned strike days by An Garda Síochána starting tomorrow, an exclusive report in today’s Irish Independent has revealed that Sinn Féin are planning an audacious coup and will try to overthrow the government. 
Pictured by photographers engaging in some basic military drills in rural Louth, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams could be seen dancing from the top of his tank to a trad version of Ride of The Valkyries. 
With chaos on our streets 100% guaranteed tomorrow as Gardaí strike, it is believed the opposition party had been planning a coup d’etat for months, according to Indo sources. 
“I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life,” Adams is believed to have said to a number of his stuffed teddy bears which also occupied his tank. Adams then drove his tank through a set of gates beside some homeless people, positioned in such a way as to mimic the conditions outside Leinster House. 
The Republican party’s attempt to overthrow the government will be made easier by the fact that, thanks to the garda strike, stretched and limited resources will be directed to stopping the Nation’s criminals from robbing everyone’s TVs from their homes. 
It is alleged that Adams’s first action as Taoiseach post-coup would be to achieve a united Ireland, which no longer seems as controversial a prospect as it once was if a recent Irish News poll is anything to go by, which stated that 98% of people with Celtic tattoos would vote for a united Ireland.",0

Olympics CEO: Trump More Helpful than Obama - Breitbart,"LA2024 Chief Executive Officer Gene Sykes told Southern California Public Radio’s 89. 3 KPCC last Thursday that President Donald Trump had been more helpful than President Barack Obama in helping to secure the 2024 Olympics for Los Angeles. [Last month, as Breitbart News reported, President Trump gave his strong support to L. A.’s Olympic bid after meeting with the International Olympic Committee: “I would love to see the Olympics go to Los Angeles. I think that it’ll be terrific. The United States committee’s members have asked me to speak up about it, and I have, and I think I’ve helped them, and let’s see what happens. ”  In contrast, Sykes said, President Obama had been noncommittal, following his lackluster role in Chicago’s failed bid to host the 2016 games. “He [Obama] never went to an Olympic games, never met with the IOC [International Olympic Committee] leadership, never talked to them by phone, and showed sort of a disregard and that was deeply frustrating to the leaders of the IOC,” Sykes told KPCC. Sykes also acknowledged that Trump’s role was a “  sword,” given global opposition to some of his policies, as well as bad media coverage. In February, former L. A. mayor (and 2018 gubernatorial candidate) Antonio Villaraigosa worried openly that Trump’s immigration policies would hurt the city’s Olympic bid. 2024 would mark the 40th anniversary of the highly successful 1984 Summer Olympics, dominated for Americans by memories of Carl Lewis’s    sweep (and only somewhat marred by a Soviet bloc boycott).

22985,Mexican Cartel Punishes Thieves with Highway Hanging,"REYNOSA, Tamaulipas  —   Mexico’s Gulf Cartel has hung two men described as thieves and highway robbers next to a banner where the criminal organization claims to not be behind their crimes. [After days of multiple highway robberies, the criminal organization known as the Gulf Cartel has sought to distance itself from a series of violent crimes including highway robberies, extortion, and kidnappings.   On Tuesday morning, gunmen from the Gulf Cartel hung two men and a banner from a bridge in one of this city’s most traveled highways. The two men had not been killed but were beaten. The banner was signed by Comandante Toro, the leader of the Reynosa faction of the Gulf Cartel, where he claimed to not be behind the rash of crime that has been affecting the city:  To all citizens, the government and social media, I am tired that for everything that happens, I or the company gets blamed. That if they rob, that if they kidnap, everything gets blamed on myself or the company —  and we are fed up that we are singled out as the guilty ones. Our job is a different one and as proof, I present to you the rats that hid behind us while they robbed and kidnapped. Every robbing and kidnapping rat that we find will be turned over. We want a city in peace, that is why we removed gunmen from the streets, we want to prove it to authorities these rats are not part of our company. The men had been beaten before they were hung from the bridge using duct tape. One of the men sustained more injuries when he fell nearly 12 feet while authorities were trying to lower him.  The display by the leader of the criminal organization comes just days after travelers from cities such as Monterrey, Nuevo Leon and its surrounding suburbs have taken to social media to warn others about gunmen carrying out brazen highway robberies near the city. The tourists point to an almost complete lack of patrolling by Mexican federal authorities, particularly in the outskirts of Reynosa where the robberies and the kidnappings have taken place.  The alarm that the messages created led to the McAllen Economic Development Corporation and an association of manufacturing plants in Reynosa to post on their Facebook pages a message from Mexican Federal Police officers where they claim that they have stepped up their patrolling along the highway to ensure public safety.  Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

22988,Wear Your MAGA Gear in Public Every Day Until the Election!,"The Face to Face blog has some good advice for yall muffugguhs: 
In order to push back against attempts at demoralization, particularly from the media, and to rally people heading down the home stretch, it’s time to start wearing Trump markers in public every day until the election is over. 
That will manifest our greater enthusiasm in an everyday setting, not just what people see from rallies on TV or comments on the internet. It puts a human face on the movement, which does not come across so much from a yard sign (although put up one of those too). 
It is also more likely to have a contagious effect at the grassroots. Even if onlookers don’t wear Trump gear of their own, at least they’ll be more likely to talk positively about voting to others, assuming they were roughly on our side. 
The goal is not to appear confrontational, as though we were about to man the barricades (that would come only if the Establishment tries to steal the election). Everyday people around you are not the immediate enemy. Those who are uncertain about turning out, or are genuinely undecided, are on the wimpy and cucky side — they just want to be reassured that Trump voters are normal people. 
I guarantee that no one from the enemy’s side will try to shame or ostracize you in public, in order to send a message to undecided onlookers. Only paid activists bother attempting this, and they only concentrate at Trump rallies or on the internet. Even the strongly committed Hillary voters are too demoralized to confront a stranger. The only responses you will get will be from fellow travelers, especially ones who were uncertain whether they were the only one leaning toward Trump, and are relieved to see someone being the first to break the silence in public. 
Trump has been taking so much public abuse, slander, and libel on our behalf — the least we can do is put ourselves out there, too, whether we get a few sideways glances or not. 
At this stage, giving our public support matters more than giving financial support. The polls are not so tight because of insufficient advertising. It’s because a handful of people are still uneasy about either turning out, or choosing Trump if they do. Making those people feel more comfortable by seeing real-life support for Trump in public will go farther than hearing an ad on the drive to work. 
And some of them truly have no preference other than joining the in-group. With no visible signs of support from Hillary voters, that only leaves the Trump side for the conformists to join. Who would want to join a group that is weakly held together, when there’s a more emotionally connected group as the alternative? 
You don’t have to go all-out all day long, but at least wear a hat or shirt out for an hour or so in normal public places. High-traffic retail spaces are best, like a supermarket. 
It’s simple to find places selling Trump hats if you don’t already have one. 
There’s no excuse to stay sitting on the sidelines with less than two weeks to go. We need to make our presence known — not just as a warning to the enemy, but more importantly to motivate anyone who doesn’t like Crooked Hillary to show up and vote Trump with the rest of the crowd. 
This election is now 100% about demoralization – on both sides. 
We have to keep our morale up, so that our people will go out and vote on the 8th. Huge portions of Hillary’s people aren’t going to bother, especially with new scandals dropping every minute.",0
22989,Hillary Now Caught Red-Handed Fixing FOREIGN Election? In Her Own Words: [AUDIO],"0 comments Hillary has been caught in a NEW scandal and this one has FOREIGN implications as it involves trying to FIX a Palestinian election. Listen to how casually Hillary recommends “determining” the winner in a Palestinian election when she thinks the conversation won’t get out… …then imagine what she’d do to win this one? Unearthed tape: ‘We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win’ The Observer reports : The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton’s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is “rigged”! Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). 
“ I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, ” said Sen. Clinton. “ And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. ” Today The FBI has reopened their email investigation because Hillary keeps lying. Now this? All on the heels that WikiLeaks proved she is a drunk…HMMM I have this feeling that Hillary is somewhere drowning herself in a bottle of boos! She might want to go on a two week binge! This action is atrocious! To meddle in foreign elections is abominable and Hillary and Obama have both done so more than once. Insanity! I called Hillary for comment. She said, “What difference does it make?”",0
22990,Samsung profits plunge by 30% following disastrous fires involving Note 7 smartphones,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:56 UTC South Korean electronics giant Samsung has reported a drop in third-quarter profit of 30 percent, following the disastrous recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. The company's overall operating profit fell to $4.6 billion which is the lowest level in two years. Its mobile division's operating profit collapsed 98 percent to just $88 million. Samsung said this month it will lose approximately $3.1 billion on the Note 7 recall over the next six months. The company has scrapped the entire line less than two months after its launch due to safety considerations. That followed a global recall of at least 2.5 million phones due to faulty batteries that could ignite. The manufacturer assured customers fixed devices were safe but the problems with overheating and fires continued. After weeks of unsuccessful attempts to save the brand's image, the electronics firm announced it was ending the production and sale of the Note 7's. The troubled smartphones have been banned by major airlines worldwide. ""Regarding the mobile business, the company will focus on expanding sales of new flagship products with differentiated design and innovative features, as well as regaining consumers' confidence,"" Samsung said on Thursday. The company's new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 8 is expected to be released in February. ""Samsung has lost consumer confidence, but I think it still has at least one more chance. Rather than rushing to release the next product, it should conduct a thorough inspection and explain the results of its investigation into the Note 7, "" Greg Roh an analyst at HMC Investment Securities told the BBC.",0

22993,White House Vows ‘Emergency Stay’ of Judicial Order Thwarting President’s Immigration Order - Breitbart,"The White House issued a statement vowing to file for an emergency stay of a federal judge’s order to block President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting immigration and refugees from high risk countries from the Middle East. [“At the earliest possible time, the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of this order and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate,” read a statement from Sean Spicer to reporters.  The statement explained that Trump’s order was issued under his constitutional authority to protect the American people. U. S. District Court Judge James Robart took the unusual step of issuing a emergency stay of Trump’s order as the attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota filed a lawsuit to overturn the legislation. The plaintiffs argue that Trump’s order violates the U. S. Constitution and federal law, including what they say is discrimination against a particular religion. But Trump defied the order, sending a message on Twitter on Saturday. “The opinion of this   judge, which essentially takes   away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!” he wrote.

22994,“WE’VE HAD ENOUGH!” Italian Prime Minister threatens to cripple the EU unless it stops mass Muslim migration,"BNI Store Nov 2 2016 “WE’VE HAD ENOUGH!” Italian Prime Minister threatens to cripple the EU unless it stops mass Muslim migration FURIOUS Italian leader Matteo Renzi today threatened to fatally cripple the entire European Union project unless Brussels bureaucrats do something about ending the Muslim invasion. UK Express In an extraordinary threat the apoplectic PM vowed to veto the EU budget and starve Brussels of taxpayers’ cash, inducing complete paralysis, if the refugee chaos is not fixed by the end of this year. A visibly angry Mr Renzi warned that Italy “cannot survive” another influx of migrants in 2017 similar to the one it faced this year and blasted Europe’s “inability to show solidarity” on the issue. His remarkable threat marks another ratcheting up of the growing tensions between Rome and Brussels, whose friendship has been stretched to breaking point by the migration crisis. Italy has become the focal point for millions of migrants and refugees hoping to reach Europe ever since the route to Greece was effectively cut off by a repatriation deal with Turkey. More than 155,000 Muslim freeloaders posing as asylum seekers have arrived in the country this year alone after crossing the Mediterranean from Libya on rickety smugglers’ boats. But Austria, Switzerland and France to the north have shored up their borders meaning almost all of those have become trapped in Italy, placing a huge strain on services and local communities. Speaking to the talk show Porta a Porta last night, Mr Renzi blasted: “Either we block the influx by 2017 or Italy will not handle another year like the past year.” And he warned: “Right now we can manage it. Winter is coming and sea conditions will worsen, but we have six months maximum.” Mr Renzi also strongly hinted that he will veto the EU budget in retaliation for the critical situation unless Brussels steps in and forces member states to take in their fair share of migrants. He blasted: “If the Eastern countries who are growing with the help of our money do not open their doors to migrants as has been agreed, then we’ll put a veto on the future European budget.” An EU Commission to impose migrant quotas on countries has run into difficulty following furious opposition from eastern European countries and a less than enthusiastic response from others already struggling with the pressures of mass migration. A number of member states including Hungary, which recently held a referendum where 98 per cent of voters rejected migrant quotas, are even taking legal proceedings against the EU in a bid to hold up the scheme. And Italy’s interior minister, Angelino Alfano, backed up Mr Renzi’s extraordinary ultimatum to veto the EU budget and withhold funds from Brussels unless it resolves the impasse. He said: “We must use the veto. We give our money so that, in exchange for these duties, the others honour their commitments. “Money does not go through walls. You know what? If they don’t help us, we will not give more money.” Referring to the country’s net budget contribution under its former leader, the technocrat Mario Monti, he added: “The Monti government determined that we give 20 billion [euros] and receive 12, but if Hungary and Slovakia give us moral lessons about our money and then refuse to give us a hand on migrants, that doesn’t work.”",0

22996,Прощальные слезы Обамы и Европы | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: Европа В своей новой статье независимый немецкий журналист Грета Маутнер отмечает, что прощальная поездка уходящего президента США Барака Обамы в Европу стала знаковой во многих отношениях. Прибыв в Европу как представитель проигравшей стороны, Обама пытался успокоить европейских лидеров, встревоженных победой Дональда Трампа, и заверить их, что американская политика в отношении Европы и НАТО с его уходом не претерпит значительных изменений. Как подчеркнуло издание Le Figaro , когда Белый дом сообщил Франции о том, что Барак Обама едет в Европу прощаться, тут же французского президента Франсуа Олланда «попросили», без какого-либо обсуждения, как и его итальянского, испанского и британского коллег, лишь присоединиться к Обаме и немецкому канцлеру в Берлине на собрании «шестерки». В глазах Вашингтона Ангела Меркель затмила Олланда. Однако демонстрируемые «симпатии администрации Обамы» к Ангеле Меркель причудливо сочетаются с активным прослушиванием ее телефонов со стороны американских спецслужб — АНБ и ЦРУ. Демонстрируя свою «непоколебимую верность Белому дому», Меркель сделала все, чтобы «загасить» скандал с прослушкой и вассальной политикой в отношении США, вызвавшей в 2015 году громадный резонанс. Во многом благодаря такой прелюбострастной политики Меркель к Белому дому, администрация Обамы стала чемпионом по «выбиванию» штрафных денег из германских конкурентов: Deutsche Bank (14 млрд долларов) и Volkswagen (15 млрд долларов). Поэтому не удивительно, что уже в первом пункте «европейского прощального турне» — в Афинах особых слез из-за расставаний с Обамой никто не лил. Жители этой «колыбели демократии» показали свое истинное отношение к Обаме и проводимой им политике, тысячами пройдя от Политехнического университета к посольству США в Афинах с антиамериканскими лозунгами и критикой действий Обамы. Похожая реакция была и в Германии, где подобострастная политика Меркель в отношении Белого дома уже стоила ей и партии ХДС значительной потери голосов на сентябрьских берлинских выборах, что привело к возникновению в феврале 2013 года крайне правой, антиевропейской партии «Альтернатива для Германии» (AfD). Наследием Обамы остаются войска в Афганистане, тюрьма в Гуантанамо, спровоцированные «цветные революции» на Ближнем Востоке и конфликт на Украине, тысячи мечущихся по Ближнему Востоку и Европе мирных граждан, потерявших кров из-за военной агрессии администрации Обамы. Именно это и остается в головах миллионов европейцев от 8-летнего бесславного президентства Б. Обамы! Да, остаются слезы, слезы горечи! Но не от того, что политику покидает Обама, а от того, что Обама оставался в ней, к несчастью миллионов людей, целых восемь лет! С полным содержанием статьи вы можете ознакомиться здесь .

22998,WIKILEAK: Hillary’s Team Exploited Shooting Of Black Teen To Push Gun Control,"ALERT: Clinton “Assault Weapon Ban” Resurrected… Gun Owners Beware 
Hillary for America speechwriter Lauren Peterson wrote to the Clinton camp on Jan. 14, 2016: “Marie Claire has partnered with Harvard on a study that looks at women and guns … and they’ve asked Hillary to contribute an essay on the subject.” 
Campaign political director Amanda Renteria referred to the column entitled “Yes, Guns Are a Women’s Issue” as “a great piece.”   
Director of engagement De’Ara Balenger echoed the sentiment but noted a potential point of concern: 
“Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably — this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence,” Balenger wrote. “Was there another mother in the Chicago meeting where the shooting was not racially motivated? If yes, we should use that story instead of Jordan Davis?” 
Policy adviser Corey Ciorciari made the campaign’s stance on using race to push their agenda clear in his response: 
“You know where I stand on this,” he wrote. “It can be racially motivated and gun violence should still very much be part of the discussion.”  ",0
22999,"NATO, US, And UK Assemble Largest Troop Buildup On Russian Border Since Cold War","By John Vibes
In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war.
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks.
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia’s border.
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia’s borders as part of a huge military deployment.
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia’s borders since the Cold War.
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time.
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a “deterrent” to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war.
“This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday — ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation.
Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to ‘prevent conflict.’
The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad.
The United States’ envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO’s deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else’s lands.
“This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia’s) security posture,” Lute said.
If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government.
These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds.
Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today.

23000,GRAPHIC: Cartel Incinerates Rivals in Mexican Border State,"CIUDAD VICTORIA, Tamaulipas  —   As Mexican drug cartels continue to fight for control of this city, authorities are now investigating another gruesome execution where various suspected cartel members were murdered and set on fire inside a car. [The gruesome discovery was made by Tamaulipas State authorities on Sunday afternoon after emergency services personnel responded to a rural area called Las Norias, near the Esfuerzo Popular neighborhood. Authorities were responding to a call about a torched car.   Inside the   vehicle, investigators found human remains. Next to the vehicle, the cartel gunman left a poster with a threatening message where a group called La Barredora or the “sweeper” took credit for the murders. It remains unclear which cartel the group is associated with.  As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, Ciudad Victoria has been ground zero for an ongoing turf war between rival the factions of Los Zetas. The violence between two rival factions has led to regular kidnappings, murders, shootouts, and gory executions. While the fighting appears to have started in Ciudad Victoria, it has since spread to the Tamaulipas border city of Nuevo Laredo and the neighboring states of Nuevo Leon and Coahuila. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by “M. A. Navarro” from Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas. ",0
23001,Apple iPhone Is Targeted in Beijing Patent Case - The New York Times,"HONG KONG  —   In China, cheap smartphones made by relatively obscure companies aping branded designs are ubiquitous. Usually it is the major brands that go after the smaller companies for patent infringement. But one of China’s   phone makers recently filed a patent complaint against Apple in the city of Beijing  —   and for now, it has won. With an appeals process ahead, the ruling is unlikely to have a major impact on Apple. Still, the action spotlights the growing number of cases of municipal patent offices in China backing local companies against larger, international brands. According to a statement from the Beijing Intellectual Property Office, Apple infringed on a design patent used in a phone called the 100C, made by the Chinese phone maker Baili. The statement ordered Apple to stop selling certain older versions of the iPhone within Beijing, though an appeal of such a ruling to the courts in China usually forestalls any sales injunctions. Apple said it had appealed, and a sales clerk at the Apple Store in the Sanlitun area of Beijing said on Friday evening that the store had received no instructions to stop selling the iPhone models and that “it is business as usual. ” At the store, a handful of iPhone 6 models stood mostly unused as shoppers tapped on the newer 6s models at a nearby table. “IPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone SE models, are all available for sale today in China,” Apple said in a statement. “We appealed an administrative order from a regional patent tribunal in Beijing last month, and as a result the order has been stayed pending review by the Beijing I. P. Court. ” The new headache for Apple comes after increased regulatory pressure and problems in China. Recently, a Chinese company won the right to sell leather goods under the iPhone trademark after years of legal back and forth. And Apple’s movie and book services were shut down in the country shortly after they were introduced, a sign of more serious scrutiny from China’s media regulator. The Baili patent case pales in comparison to those troubles, though it underscores the    annoyances that can come with running a tech business in China. The country has had its fair share of cases in which   manufacturers take on global brands. In perhaps the most famous, Apple paid $60 million to use the iPad trademark. Patent issues like the one Apple has with Baili are common enough that a recent paper in the Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment  Technology Law examined the topic. While the paper found that China’s patent system was not structured to benefit Chinese companies, it said there had been a number of recent “  patent suits filed by relatively unknown Chinese firms against   foreign tech companies like Apple, Samsung and Dell. ” Once a local intellectual property office in China finds an issue of infringement, companies can decide whether to appeal the matter. At that point, the issue typically is litigated or resolved via a settlement of some kind.",0
23002,NBC’s Tur to GOP Rep Rooney: ’I Don’t Know What You’re Referring To’ With Obama Promising Russia ’More Flexibility’ - Breitbart,"UPDATE: After the show, Tur addressed the moment on Twitter, saying, “To be fair, I didnt [sic] touch politics in 2012. I almost exclusively covered fires and shootings in NYC area. ” She added, “And I’d rather be honest about what I know and don’t know in the moment. Got off air, did the research, then talked about it at 5pm on MTPD. ” Tur did reference the “flexibility” comments while hosting “MTP Daily” later in the day.  During an interview with Representative Francis Rooney on Monday’s “MSNBC Live,” host Katy Tur stated that she didn’t know what Rooney was referring to when he referenced (with an incorrect retelling of which Russian Obama was speaking to) President Obama telling Russia, “After my election, I have more flexibility. ” Rooney said that we’ll have to see what President Trump “does, not just what he says. ” And that Putin is “a serious character” that “we need to deal forcefully with. ” He later predicted that Trump would be “firm” with Russia. Rooney added that he didn’t know what Trump meant with his comments that the US has killers as well, and “I definitely think we need to protect the Baltics, and some of the talk of moving NATO exercises over to Poland and Estonia, I think’s a real good idea. I think Putin is going to respond to actions. ” Later on, Tur stated that there were people in the Trump administration who have friendlier views of Russia than past administrations. Rooney countered, “Well, I think it was Obama that leaned over to Putin [Note: Obama’s comment that he’d have ‘more flexibility’ after the election was said to Dmitry Medvedev, not Putin. After the interview, Rooney tweeted a correction] and said, I’ll have a little more flexibility to give you what you want after the  . ” Tur then stated, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re referring to, Congressman. ” Rooney said, “Remember when he leaned over at a panel discussion  —   or a meeting and he said, I’ll have more flexibility after the election. no one ever really pushed the president on what he meant by that, but I can only assume for a thug like Putin, that it would embolden him. ” Rooney tweeted after the interview, “My error, it was Medvedev that Obama whispered to about flexibility. Still projects Obama admin weakness in dealing with Russia. ” (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0

23006,Black Lives Matter LOSES: America’s Respect For Police SURGES,"Pinterest 
In the war between police and Black Lives Matter, the cop-hating race-baiters are losing. 
A new study shows a dramatic increase in respect for law enforcement among all Americans, including blacks, who have been repeatedly told they were the victims of a racist, white-supremacist-supporting police force. 
In just the last year, Americans who say they have a “great deal of respect” for police has jumped from 64 percent to 76 percent — the highest level since 1968. Those saying they have “some” respect for police is down to 17 percent and those claiming to have “hardly any” respect for police is down to 7 percent. 
The Gallup survey flies in the face of the narrative of leftists and Black Lives Matter. They’re trying to convince Americans – especially black Americans – that the police are on a racist rampage and that they have nothing more to fear in this country than a man in uniform. 
But the public doesn’t buy it. 
With both whites and “non-whites,” respect for police is up sharply. Four in five white Americans say they have “a great deal” of respect for the police in their area, while just over two in three “non-whites” also say they have a “great deal” of respect. 
Respect for police is highest among Republicans, at 86 percent, but even 68 percent of Democrats claim a “great deal” of respect. 
Adults 55 and older (81%) have the most respect, but even those 18-34 had high levels of respect at 71%. 
There is a moral to this for the BLM Social Justice Warriors: You can paint our cops as racist thugs, but we know better. Police risk their lives every day to protect us and deserve our utmost respect. And judging by this poll, they’re getting it. 
From the Gallup Poll: 
The sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive — both politically and for their lives while they are on duty — amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings. After an officer was killed by a gunman in Harlem last year, then-New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton warned that the U.S. has fostered “an anti-police attitude that has grown” and that the national dialogue on police-community relations needs to discourage individuals who “exhibit anti-police behavior or attitudes.” 
Louisiana became the first state to pass a bill that treats acts targeted against police officers as a hate crime. Other states are discussing passing similar laws. It’s unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer. 
Although confidence in police varies among subgroups, majorities of all groups say they have a great deal of respect for their local police. And the percentage of national adults who say they have “hardly any” respect for local law enforcement remains small.",0
23009,The Guardian: Robot Economy Could Lead to ’Genocidal’ Class War - Breitbart,"The Guardian has published an article on the rise of the robot economy, with some fairly dramatic predictions. Not only could the rich get richer, writes the author, but it is “perfectly plausible” that they could choose to eliminate the poor. [From the article:  Meanwhile, robotic capital would enable elites to completely secede from society. From private jets to private islands, the rich already devote a great deal of time and expense to insulating themselves from other people. But even the best fortified luxury bunker is tethered to the outside world, so long as capital needs labor to reproduce itself. Mass automation would make it possible to sever this link. Equipped with an infinite supply of workerless wealth, elites could seal themselves off in a gated paradise, leaving the unemployed masses to rot. If that scenario isn’t bleak enough, consider the possibility that mass automation could lead not only to the impoverishment of working people, but to their annihilation. In his book Four Futures, Peter Frase speculates that the economically redundant hordes outside the gates would only be tolerated for so long. After all, they might get restless  —   and that’s a lot of possible pitchforks. “What happens if the masses are dangerous but are no longer a working class, and hence of no value to the rulers?” Frase writes. “Someone will eventually get the idea that it would be better to get rid of them. ” He gives this future an appropriately frightening name: “exterminism” a world defined by the “genocidal war of the rich against the poor”. The author argues that without “substantive political change,” such a scenario is “perfectly plausible. ” He also argues that a robot tax, an idea recently endorsed by Bill Gates, ought to be considered. These dystopias may sound like science fiction, but they’re perfectly plausible given our current trajectory. The technology around robotics and artificial intelligence will continue to improve  —   but without substantive political change, the outcome will range from bad to apocalyptic for most people. That’s why the recent rumblings about a robot tax are worth taking seriously. They offer an opportunity to develop the political response to mass automation now, before it’s too late.

However, the founder and creative director of the game’s developer, Tim Soret, quickly became the target of intense attacks from leftists on social media after it emerged that he endorsed the GamerGate movement in 2014. GamerGate, accused by some leftist commentators as a precursor to the Trump movement, spent over two years pushing for improved journalistic standards and against censorship in the videogame industry. Now a Ubisoft employee is threatening to pirate and “seed” copies of The Last Night on the internet so that Soret “gets no monies. ” @Ubisoft Hi, one of your employees is advocating piracy of an independent developer’s game.

23015,Terror Tots: We Must Prepare for the Child-Fighters of ISIS,"0 comments There are thousands of children who live under ISIS control and they are training them to kill and terrorize. They are teaching them to blow people up and shoot them. 
These ISIS children are becoming suicide bombers and they are executing people. Many have yet to reach puberty. 
Throughout history, evil has taken advantage of the innocence and pliability of children. ISIS has taken that to the extreme. 
This video will tear your heart in half and make you angry at the same time. 
If these children come to our shores, what do we do? How do we deal with this insanity? ISIS’ children have proven to be effective weapons. ISIS is extremely organized in the preparation of these children. The Observer reports : 
While they learn the deadly art of warfare, the children are also schooled in the three Rs—readin’, ‘riting and ‘rithmetic. ISIS runs a network of schools that the children attend. A Foreign Affairs piece by Mia Bloom attests to two schools that cater to English-speaking students. 
Some of the children are local, but many of them are foreigners, that is, not born and bred in Syria, Iraq or Yemen. The kids come from all over the world and the schools are set up to teach them in their native languages. They come from all over including China and Kazakhstan, from Belgium and Germany and England and the US. 
They even come from Israel. 
ISIS figured it out without our help. Children play a very large role in their own propaganda and recruiting materials. They also play central roles in their activity. Highly trained kids are referred to by ISIS elders as their “cubs.” These “cubs” are the crème de la crème. 
We face a religion of evil. It is not a religion of peace.These men are pure evil and this latest tactic proves such. I hope those in our government are thinking of how to deal with these children if they ever reach our shores. It will not be an easy solution.",0

23028,How Much Can Mike Pence Help Donald Trump? - The New York Times,"Here’s a good rule about   selections: Even when they matter, they usually don’t matter much. Donald J. Trump’s newly selected running mate, Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, seems even less likely to affect the result than most. He’s a relatively safe choice: an experienced but relatively unknown politician from a state that the Republicans were already expected to win. It is hard to argue that   selections make big differences in presidential elections. It’s not even obvious that Sarah Palin, for all of her challenges, was a big drag on John McCain in 2008. Mr. McCain lost by just seven percentage points  —   a pretty good outcome considering George W. Bush’s approval ratings at the time and the state of the economy at the height of the financial crisis. Mr. Pence seems a lot less likely to shake up the race than Mrs. Palin. He carries relatively few risks and little upside for Mr. Trump. He is not a   figure. A recent New York   News poll found that 86 percent of registered voters were either undecided or did not know enough about him to have an opinion. He’s an experienced politician who seems unlikely to endanger the ticket by appearing unqualified for the presidency if the need were to arise. Typically, most of the effect of   candidates can be found in their home states, where a selection can help a ticket by a couple of percentage points. There are a few examples of bigger boosts: The selection of Mrs. Palin, for instance, probably helped Mr. McCain by more than five percentage points in Alaska in 2008. But there are also instances where it’s hard to identify an effect at all. Mr. Pence’s home state, Indiana, is already thought to lean toward Mr. Trump. Mitt Romney carried the state by 10 points in 2012, and the Clinton campaign is not bothering to air advertisements in the state. Mr. Pence is not especially popular in Indiana either. He won the governor’s race narrowly in 2012, even as Mr. Romney comfortably carried the state. His approval ratings slipped into the 40s after his support for the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which caused some businesses and state governments to boycott the state because they believed it made it easier to allow discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Recent surveys showed that Mr. Pence was even in some danger of losing   this fall. Mr. Pence’s record of supporting conservative cultural causes like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act could easily define whatever modest effect his nomination ultimately has on voters. It could help Mr. Trump solidify the support of consistently conservative voters who may have reservations about his iconoclastic views. The   of course, is that it may help Hillary Clinton win socially moderate voters. But the opportunities for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton to make gains among these groups is fairly limited. A recent Pew Research survey found that white evangelical Christians supported Mr. Trump,   an even larger margin than Mr. Romney’s lead at this time in 2012. Mrs. Clinton, though, is faring about as well among nonreligious voters as President Obama did four years earlier. And with candidates as well known as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton at the top of the tickets, the opportunity for a   nominee to move the needle might be even smaller than usual.",0

At least 47 people, including women and children, have been killed and over 110 others injured in a huge bomb explosion in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. 
The blast hit Shah Noorani shrine in Lasbela district on Saturday evening, Balochistan's Home Minister Sarfaraz Bugti said. 
The shrine is located about 100 kilometers north of the port city of Karachi. Staff members of a local hospital in Karachi wait for casualties of a bomb blast at Shah Noorani shrine in Balochistan province, Pakistan, November 12, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
The injured, he added, would be taken to hospitals in Lasbela, Khuzdar or Civil Hospital in Karachi as there are no medical centers available in the area. 
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif denounced the bomb attack, calling on authorities to speed up the rescue operation. 
Reports say some 500 people were in the shrine when the bomb went off. 
""Every day, around sunset, there is a dhamaal (a Sufi ritual dance) here, and there are large numbers of people who come for this,"" said Nawaz Ali, the shrine's custodian. 
The Daesh terror group has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack. 
Pakistani security officials are saying the terrorist attack was in response to the killing of Jundullah chief by Pakistani police which took place in the early hours of Friday morning. 
On October 24, Daesh also claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 60 people in an attack by its terrorists on a police college in Baluchistan’s provincial capital Quetta. It was one of the deadliest attacks on Pakistan's security forces in recent years. 
In August, Daesh claimed responsibility for another attack on a gathering of mourners at a hospital in Quetta, where 70 people were killed. The attack was also claimed by Pakistani Taliban faction Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. 
Pakistan’s restive and mineral-rich Balochistan province is rife with separatist, extremist and sectarian violence and has been the scene of several bomb and gun attacks over the past years. Loading ... ",0

Today, the US tries to accuse Russia of war crimes in Syria , Lavrov said in an interview for Rossiya 1 TV channel for a documentary about Russian politician Yevgeny Primakov. ""When a true patriot, an experienced politician, an outstanding statesman, a man with great intuition, with an encyclopedic education - when he learned about the bombings of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the United States, he did not see any possibility to continue ""business as usual"" with the USA. His plane made a U-turn in midair, and that U-turn meant that Russia could not but defend its truth in cooperation with other powers to achieve equal relations and mutually advantageous arrangements - this is the purpose that Russia has,"" Sergei Lavrov said. ""The aggression against Yugoslavia was, of course, an act of aggression, and it was also the first armed attack on a sovereign state in Europe since 1945. If we talk about it now against the background of what is happening around Syria, our Western partners, especially American and British ones, have already reached the level of public threats in their hysteria, using words such as ""barbaric,"" ""war crimes,"" said Sergey Lavrov.""The aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was fraught with attacks on a huge number of civilian targets, including, among other things, television of Serbia, bridges, on which civilian passenger trains were traveling and a lot more. Thousands were killed, including several hundreds of children, a quarter of a million of refugees, whom no one has ever thought of since then. If Russia, in Primakov's face, would not have reacted the way that he had reacted to such a blatant violation of international law, we wouldn't have probably forgiven that to ourselves for a long time, and our history would have had another very unpleasant page,"" the Russian Foreign Minister said.

23038,NBC News Head Says ’We’re Not the Opposition Party’,"NBC News chairman Andy Lack said Tuesday that President Donald Trump “has us a bit more focused on temperament than we expected,” but he derided Trump’s complaints about “fake news” and the role the media has played in covering the campaign and now the administration. [“We’re not the opposition party, and we’re not in a popularity contest with this administration or any administration,” Lack said at a panel discussion at New York’s IESE Business School, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  That referred to remarks made by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in an interview in February, in which he said, “I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States. ” This sentiment was later back by President Trump when he told an interviewer, “I think the media’s the opposition party in many ways. ” Lack said an adversarial relationship between the press and the president is “fundamental to our democracy. We go through periods where we’re in the crosshairs, we’re targeted. ” “Here we are again,” he asserted. “We’re not going to be intimidated by that. I think it’s a distraction from what we’d like to focus on, which is policy. ” But NBC News has not always met that mark. According to the New York Post, the Wikileaks dump of Democratic National Committee emails included one from CNBC anchor John Harwood to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta saying, “Let’s be honest, is this a   version of a presidential campaign?” Another email to Podesta said, “I imagine   …     that Obama feels some (sad) vindication at this demonstration of his   point about the opposition party veering off the rails. ” On election night, Rachel Maddow said on MSNBC, “I mean, to have the first   president succeeded by a guy who was endorsed by the KKK   …     it’s a big deal. ” Earlier in the fall, Lawrence O’Donnell, also of MSNBC, called Trump “an imbecile candidate. ” And before that, Maddow said, “I’ve been reading a lot about what it was like when Hitler first became chancellor. I think that’s possibly where we are” if Trump is elected.",0

23041,"Despite Gaining Some In The National Polls, The Electoral Math Remains Dismal For Trump","Despite Gaining Some In The National Polls, The Electoral Math Remains Dismal For Trump   
Allow me to be the voice of reason and sanity amidst a storm of doubt, recrimination, and uncertainty. Yes, Donald Trump has narrowed the margin since the news from FBI Director James Comey on Friday that information “pertinent” to the matter of Hillary Clinton’s email server had been found on a device belonging to disgraced Congressman and sexting freak Anthony Weiner, but it’s time to look beyond the superficial statistics and dive a bit deeper into the real math which wins Presidential elections. 
The ABC News/Washington Post national tracking poll shows Trump within 1 point of Hillary Clinton in a four-way race that includes Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Last week, that same poll had Clinton up nationally by 12 points. Oh my gosh! She lost 11 points in a single week? No. That’s nearly impossible to have happened, which means there is a better than 99 percent chance it hasn’t. 
Also, one does not win a Presidential election on the national level. Such races are won on a state-by-state basis and then electoral votes are awarded to whatever candidate wins a particular state. In other words, the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is 50 individual state races which will determine who the next occupant of the Oval Office will be. 
So, if we look at the aggregate polling data–i.e. data from many polls–we see that based on that information the HuffPost Pollster model shows Clinton leading by 7 points in a two-way race and 6 points when third party candidates are included . 
OK, you can breathe now. 
Also, despite the recent fluctuations in national polls, there remains virtually no discernible path by which Trump can get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. Now this isn’t to say that we can all just sit back and expect others to do our voting for us. All of us–liberals, progressives, moderates, the rational and sane who do not want to give a psychopath nuclear weapons–have to get out and vote for Clinton if we value our future and those of our families. 
Thanks once again to the good folks at the Huffington Post, we can clearly see that Hillary Clinton now has a 98 percent chance of being the next President of the United States. 
Whew! Feeling much better now. 
Are you kidding me?! Get up off your duff and go vote! This is no time for complacency! The fate of this country and the entire world is at stake. 
So don’t fret, but DO VOTE!

Republican nominee Donald Trump will become the 45th president of the Untied States after he surpassed Hillary Clinton and received over 270 electoral votes early Wednesday morning.
Trump’s win was called by the Associated Press, and various other outlets, after he received 276 electoral votes from Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Kansas, North Dakota, Texas, Wyoming, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, Missouri, Ohio, Florida, Idaho, North Carolina, Georgia, Utah, Iowa, Maine, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
During his victory speech Wednesday, Trump began by announcing that Clinton had called to concede.
In addition to thanks family members for their support, Trump carried a tone of unity throughout the speech, insisting that he led a movement, rather than a campaign.
“Now it’s time for America to bind the wounds of division. We have to get together. To all Republicans, and Democrats, and Independents across this nation, I say it time for us to come together as one united people. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past—of which there were a few people—I’m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help, so that we can work together and unify our great country.” 
Clinton notably did not take the stage at her campaign event in New York, and instead sent her campaign chairman, John Podesta to speak for her.

In new rules to prevent health tourism, all prospective NHS patients will be required to pass a test to prove they’re British, a top Department of Health civil servant has said. 
Simon Williams told a Commons committee that it was a controversial move but it was ‘worth it to keep all those ghastly foreigners out’. 
“The NHS has a terrible problem with awful foreigners deliberately getting cancer so they can come and loll about in great British hospitals eating curry and complaining about how Christmas decorations offend them,” said Mr Williams. 
“Obviously, the preference is to send these sort of people back to wherever they come from so they can die without bothering any decent British chaps.” 
The test for Britishness will take the form of a half-hour written exam and fifteen-minute practical test to be carried out on arrival to any NHS hospital before treatment. 
The exam will include questions on pasties, the films of James Robertson Justice, and a requirement to transcribe the third verse of God Save the Queen. 
The practical will involve making a proper cup of tea and being sexually repressed, before drinking several pints of lager, eating a kebab and mooning a policeman. Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",0
23054,Key Points on Sarin: The ‘Most Volatile’ of Nerve Agents - The New York Times,"The victims of a bombing in northern Syria this week were exposed to sarin, a banned but easily manufactured poison that has been widely used in chemical weapons, Turkish officials who conducted autopsies on the victims said on Thursday. Sarin is a nerve agent, one of a class of chemical weapons that affect the brain’s ability to communicate with the body’s organs through the nervous system. It is a colorless, tasteless, odorless liquid that was first synthesized in Germany in 1938 as a potential pesticide. Sarin is considered “the most volatile of the nerve agents,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “This means it can easily and quickly evaporate from a liquid into a vapor and spread into the environment. ” Sarin vapor does not last long, but it can be deadly if inhaled. Contact with sarin liquid on exposed surfaces, in food, or in water can also be fatal. Its effects may strike quickly or be delayed after exposure. All nerve agents belong to a class of organic compounds that contain phosphorus, and work in essentially the same way, by inhibiting the action of a crucial enzyme in the body that allows muscles and organs to contract. Without the enzyme’s action, the muscles and organs are constantly stimulated and stop working properly asphyxiation soon follows. Sarin is dangerous to handle and has a short shelf life, so it is usually stored in the form of two separate precursor compounds that will produce sarin when mixed together. On the battlefield, sarin and other nerve agents can be used against targets by spraying them as a liquid or an aerosol. Chemical bombs are designed to spray out the liquid on detonation. The Syrian government is believed to have used such a bomb this week in Idlib Province. The United Nations Chemical Convention, which bans the use of sarin in war, went into effect in 1997. The Syrian government agreed in 2013 to destroy its chemical weapons stockpile, including sarin. According to the United States military, sarin is 81 times as toxic as cyanide and 543 times as toxic as chlorine, which has been used in Syria as a chemical weapon. Chlorine has legitimate commercial uses and is not banned. Symptoms of exposure may include the pupils of the eyes shrinking to pinpoints, rapid breathing, vomiting, convulsions, paralysis and respiratory failure. Swift medical attention can reverse the effects of low levels of exposure.",0

A man is signalling his immediate availability to women by flaunting his Warhammer carrier bag today. 
Simon Williams, 34, is brazenly carrying the bag through his town centre in an ostentatious display of naked sexual availability. 
The bag is understood to contain several large plastic robots which reinforce the visual cues of his readiness to mate. 
The bag is emblazoned with the words “Space Orks W gh”, which any woman will recognise as the cry of a lone wolf seeking his latest conquest. 
“The problem is that women don’t pick up on subtle signals, so I’ve had to break out the big guns,” he told us. 
“I tried wearing a selection of badges on my lapel showing my liking of various campaigning, progressive bands but women just seem to be really unobservant like that. 
“The one time a lady drew me into a conversation about Billy Bragg it turned out she was just a chugger after £2 a week and uninterested in my mating display. 
“But I don’t think they’ll be able to resist this, especially my new set of…Age of Sigmar,” he added whilst licking his lips seductively.

23062,George Mason University Firms Up Plan to Name Law School for Scalia - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Defying pleas by many of its students and faculty to reconsider, George Mason University moved on Tuesday to finalize the renaming of its law school in honor of Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court justice who died recently. It did so after the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia declined to block the name change, ending for now a  debate that has divided George Mason’s suburban Washington campus since the university announced in March the decision to rename the school and the large gift from conservative donors prompting it. Though it was expected, the decision came as a disappointment to the students and faculty, as well as a dozen or so Democrats in the Virginia legislature, who opposed the name change out of concern that it would tie the university to a conservative justice whose views, they thought, ran counter to its educational mission. George Mason administrators ultimately found that argument unpersuasive. And on Tuesday, in a bureaucratic twist, the council’s members unanimously decided that in fact they did not have the authority to override the university’s board of visitors, which had already accepted the donations and the terms that came with them. David K. Rehr, the law school’s senior associate dean, lauded the outcome and said that though the school was better for having had the debate over the name change, it was time to move on. The combined $30 million gift  —   given by the Charles Koch Foundation and an anonymous donor  —   will fund new scholarships, a dozen new faculty positions, and two new centers in line with the school’s flagship Law and Economics Center, which emphasizes the economic effect of the law, beginning next fall. The renaming is intended to take effect July 1. “We think that looking back five, 10, 15 years from now, people will see it as an important turning point for the law school and for the students here,” Mr. Rehr said. Opponents of the renaming agree, though they argue that the changes will not be for the better, signaling to potential students of diverse backgrounds that George Mason is not welcoming to them. It is less clear what effect Tuesday’s decision will have on the increased scrutiny the gifts have prompted among faculty members over the influence conservative donors  —   chiefly Mr. Koch, the billionaire industrialist who has given tens of millions of dollars to pet projects there  —   have on Virginia’s largest public university. “This issue really brought to the surface a whole set of issues that have been alive on our campus for a long time that we have not really been responding to,” said Craig Willse, a cultural studies professor who helped lead the opposition to the change. “Specifically, the issue of Koch money has really been put on the table in a way that it hasn’t been before. ” In a series of letters to the university faculty in recent weeks, Ángel Cabrera, George Mason’s president, pledged to address concerns and reiterated that he would never cede academic independence to a private donor. A faculty senate task force studying the influence of private donors is expected to release a report in the fall. As for the name change, those who had tried to block it said they were resigned on Tuesday, if dissatisfied with the state’s inability to regulate such changes. “I think short of getting the board of visitors to change their minds, which they have demonstrated they don’t want to do, I think this is it,” said Marcus Simon, a Democratic state delegate who had led a petition drive against the change. “The name’s the name for the foreseeable future. ”",0
23065,Stock Market Plunges As FBI Re-Open Clinton Investigation,"Stock Market Plunges As FBI Re-Open Clinton Investigation Wall Street is gripped by fear the ""system is about to be shaken up"", analysts say Posted on October 29, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in News , US // 0 Comments 
The stock market plunged as the FBI announced it is reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private e-mail and mishandling of classified information, a politically explosive development just 11 days before the presidential election. FBI Dir just informed me, ""The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."" Case reopened 
— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 
“ In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation ,” Director James Comey said in a letter to committee chairmen in Congress. “ I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information. ” 
Endless scandals 
Comey said he can’t say how long the new investigation will take – raising the possibility that Clinton could go into Election Day on Nov. 9 with the new probe unresolved and still hanging over her campaign. 
The Dow Jones plunged 150 points as news of the investigation broke. Bloomberg reported , “ U.S. stocks erased gains as markets again showed themselves sensitive to perceptions about Clinton’s prospects. The Mexican peso dropped, a reflection of Trump’s plan to renegotiate trade pacts with the country and reduce immigration. “ 
Impeachment 
There was also turmoil in betting markets, as the odds on a Trump presidency rose by double digits. Odds on a President Hillary Clinton being impeached in her first term also skyrocketed, as the Democratic nominee faces up to a future engulfed by endless scandal. On Thursday Clinton warned her supporters the next 11 days will be rocky – but the bumpy ride will continue long after the election. 
Though Hillary remains favorite with betting markets, the pattern is remarkably similar to odds for Brexit in the weeks before the vote. The Remain camp was considered a certainty until weeks before the referendum, with a sharp dive in the last week. Analysts believe a repeat of the British anti-establishment vote is on the cards. 
One of Hillary Clinton’s most vocal critics on the business side is finance commentator and markets expert Jim Rickards. Jim is on a world tour promoting his book, ‘The Road to Ruin – The Global Elites’ Secret Plan for the Next Financial Crisis’ and gave an interesting interview on ABC Australia. 
Rickards says that the polls are misleading and Trump “ will probably win ” and, if he does stock markets, so heavily invested in a Clinton win will crash 10% and gold will rise $100 over night. 
“Bigger than Watergate” 
Trump celebrated the FBI’s decision at a Friday afternoon rally in New Hampshire. 
“ This is bigger than Watergate ,” Trump told the crowd, which began chanting “ lock her up ” after he told them about the probe. 
“ I have great respect that the FBI and Department of Justice have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made ,” Trump said. “ This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood .” 
House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said in a statement that “ This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators. ”",0
23066,Donald Trump announces plan to build the wall out of illegal immigrants,"Tuesday, 15 November 2016 The great wall is going to be even greater now 
President-elect Donald Trump announced today that not only is he still going to build the wall and make Mexico pay for it, but he is going to make the wall out of actual Mexicans. 
""We're going to round up all the illegal immigrants and mash them together into a lumpy brown paste,"" said The Donald from his Ivory Trump Tower. ""Then we'll lay them out on a huge rug across our Southern border and roll them up like a giant bigly burrito and let it bake in the sun until it hardens into a great wall of pain and suffering."" 
When asked what he would do to prevent animals such as donkeys from eating the Burrito Wall, Trump said he would dig a huge moat around the base and fill it with tequila. 
""It'll be the best tequila money can buy. Mexico's money, because I'm going to make them pay for that, too. So any donkeys that try to swim across and eat the wall, or any Mexicans, because let's face it some of them are probably cannibals as well as rapists, will be too drunk to climb by the time they reach it. It'll also stop any Muslims from trying to swim across because as everyone knows they're not man enough to drink, let alone drink and drown."" 
Trump brushed off concerns about a potential health hazard should the Tequila Moat become choked with rotting bodies.""We'll just fill it with piranha fish,"" he said. ""They'll be nothing left of the bodies except tiny scraps of flesh like those little yellow wormy things you find at the bottom of tequila bottles."" 
When asked if the piranhas would become too intoxicated to eat, or if they could even survive in alcohol, The Orange Overlord laughed in contempt. 
""Haven't you people ever heard the expression drinks like a fish?"" Make James Cavahl's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0

23073,Comment on Migrants battle on the streets of Paris by Auntie Lulu,"Posted on November 3, 2016 by DCG | 3 Comments 
Ain’t multiculturalism grand? 
From Daily Mail : Pictures show men lunging at each other with makeshift clubs last night next to a row of tents in the Stalingrad district of the French capital. Amid chaotic scenes, gangs of men were seen brandishing pieces of wood and squaring up for a street battle. 
The violence unfolded just hours after demolition workers supported by riot police began smashing up an illegal camp full of UK-bound migrants in Paris. It also came in the wake of the destruction of the Calais Jungle which saw refugees transported around the country. It followed thousands of migrants arriving in the French capital following the razing of the Calais Jungle refugee camp last week. 
While some 5,000 Jungle residents agreed to be bused to resettlement centres around France, many others headed off independently , saying they still wanted to get to Britain. Up to 3,000 set up tents on the pavements around the Stalingrad Metro station, which is close to the Gare du Nord Eurostar hub in the north of Paris. 
Shortly before yesterday’s clearance French president Francois Hollande said: ‘We won’t tolerate the camps any longer.’ Referring to the Paris clearance, Mr Hollande said: ‘We are going to carry out the same operation as in Calais.’ 
CRS riot police around Stalingrad said there would be a ‘gradual operation’ which is likely to go on all week until all the camps are gone. 
Meanwhile, the first ever official centre for refugees in Paris is due to be opened by the city’s Socialist council later this week. The £6m facility is also close to the Eurostar hub, and will have beds for 400 men. 
But local residents and business owners say it will attract people smugglers, and other criminals. Jean Brossard, who has been living in the area for 30 years, said: ‘None of us asked for an immigrant centre on our doorsteps. Everybody in the area is complaining. If these men want to go to England, then send them to England.’ 
Others have accused the Socialists of tokenism, saying they are simply opening the camps as a humanitarian gesture that will have no long term effect on Europe’s immigrant crisis. 
The official centre, which will include a football pitch, will only allow residents to stay for between five and 10 weeks, and is likely to shut down within two years. Another centre for women with children will also open in the Paris suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine later this year, or early next, but it too will only have a limited capacity of 350 temporary places. 
Meanwhile, French authorities have started transporting migrant children out of Calais to processing centres around France, amid tensions around the closure of the vast Jungle camp. 
Three buses carried a group of unaccompanied boys, mainly teenagers, out of the camp on Wednesday morning. French authorities transferred more than 5,000 adult migrants out of Calais last week, but the fate of its 1,500 unaccompanied children remained unclear. 
Migrants from the Middle East and Africa converged on the Jungle in hopes of crossing the English Channel to Britain. 
President Francois Hollande said this week that the children would be transferred within days to ‘dedicated centres’ where British officials can explore whether they have the right to UK asylum. 
Mr .Hollande said the others would be put in the care of French child welfare services.

23075,Egypt Retaliates for Coptic Bus Massacre with Airstrikes on Libyan Terrorist Camps - Breitbart,"On Friday afternoon, Egyptian warplanes attacked militant camps in eastern Libya to retaliate for the slaughter of 28 Coptic Christians by masked gunmen. [“The officials said the warplanes on Friday targeted the headquarters of the Shura Council in the city of Darna, where local militias are known to be linked to   not the Islamic State group,” ABC News reports.  No formal claim of responsibility for the bus attack has been made yet, but it is widely suspected to be the bloody handiwork of the Islamic State’s Egyptian franchise. The BBC cites Egyptian media reports that six strikes hit the town of Derna in Libya. Deutsche Welle cites Egyptian military sources who said they believed the terrorists who carried out the bus attack were trained at these Libyan camps. “Egypt will not hesitate at all to strike terrorist camps anywhere,” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   said in a televised address. “I say again, any camps being currently used to train terrorists, Egypt will strike. This message is clear. ” Sisi referred to the Islamic State in his speech, using the name “Daesh. ” He said their strategy “depends on driving a wedge between Muslims and Christians. ” He appealed directly to U. S. President Donald Trump for assistance, saying “I trust you, your word and your ability to make fighting global terror your primary task. ” Within minutes of Sisi’s address, President Trump released a statement: Terrorists are engaged in a war against civilization, and it is up to all who value life to confront and defeat this evil. This merciless slaughter of Christians in Egypt tears at our hearts and grieves our souls. Wherever innocent blood is spilled, a wound is inflicted upon humanity. But this attack also steels our resolve to bring nations together for the righteous purpose of crushing the evil organizations of terror, and exposing their depraved, twisted, and thuggish ideology. America also makes clear to its friends, allies, and partners that the treasured and historic Christian Communities of the Middle East must be defended and protected. The bloodletting of Christians must end, and all who aid their killers must be punished. America stands with President Al Sisi and all the Egyptian people today, and always, as we fight to defeat this common enemy. Civilization is at a precipice —  and whether we climb or fall will be decided by our ability to join together to protect all faiths, all religions, and all innocent life. No matter what, America will do what it must to protect its people.",0
23076,Eight Crossings and 192 Atoms Long: the Tightest Knot Ever Tied - The New York Times,"British scientists have tied the tightest knot ever tied and, as unlikely as it may seem, this is important. Knots are useful in everyday life and specific kinds of knots are suitable for specific tasks  —   bowlines, cleats, hitches and nooses all hold things together in different ways. The same is true on the molecular level, where braided or knotted strings of atoms and molecules can be put together in different patterns with varying characteristics. Until now, scientists have been able to create only simple molecular knots with three or five crossings of strands. Now researchers, in a study published in Science, have described a way to tie a much more complicated, and therefore much stronger, knot. Everyone knows, for example, that Kevlar is very strong  —   impenetrable even to a bullet. But why? Its molecules connect to form long chains that run parallel to each other. Together these molecules form an extremely strong yet flexible material. But the structure of Kevlar is relatively simple: identical molecules packed tightly next to each other like pencils in a pencil box. Knotted or woven strands of molecules, on the other hand, can potentially create an even more flexible, lighter and stronger material  —   a tightly knit sweater on the molecular level. To create their stronger knot, a team of researchers mixed oxygen, nitrogen and carbon in a solution with metal ions. The organic molecules wrap themselves around sticky iron ions and chloride ions, crossing in just the right ways and at just the right points. The loose ends were then sealed together chemically, forming a completely tied knot with eight crossings. The number of crossings made the knot much tighter than anything that had ever been achieved before at the molecular level. The entire loop is tiny, the length of 192 atoms. David A. Leigh, a chemistry professor at the University of Manchester and a   of the study, said that while the technique was still some time away from any practical application, the potential is clear. “Knotting and weaving have led to breakthrough technologies since prehistoric times, when men first learned to make fishing nets or weave fabrics to keep warm,” he said. “Knots are just as important at the molecular level, but we can’t exploit them until we learn how to make them. ”",0
23077,Gunman Wounds 3 at Muslim Prayer Center in Zurich - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   A gunman opened fire in a Muslim prayer center in Zurich, the largest city in Switzerland, late on Monday afternoon, wounding at least three people, according to the police. Around 5:30 p. m. the gunman entered the prayer center, in a neighborhood known as Aussersihl, just south of the city’s main train station. Several worshipers were praying. The assailant opened fire, injuring three men, ages 30, 35 and 56, before fleeing. The men were taken to a hospital. Two of the three were injured seriously, and one was lightly wounded, the police said. The police said the gunman was about 30 years old and was wearing dark clothes, including a dark woolen cap. Police officers from both the city and the canton of Zurich sealed off the area, a police spokeswoman, Judith Hödl, said in a statement. “At the moment, no further information can be provided on the affected parties and on the crime,” she said, adding an appeal for witnesses to come forward. The police later reported that the body of a man had been found on Monday evening on the Gessner Bridge, which crosses the River Sihl in the center of Zurich. The identity of the man as well as the circumstances of his death were not immediately clear. Also unclear was whether the body had any connection to the shooting, which occurred a short distance away. The attack came on the same day that Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated in Ankara, and at least  12 people were killed at a Christmas market in Berlin, in what the authorities believe was an attack. The prayer center in Zurich was largely frequented by Somali immigrants, though the backgrounds of the men who were wounded were not clear. The building can be occupied by up to 80 worshipers, but typically was used by 10 or so people at a time.",0
23078,Christie Orders Lead Tests for All New Jersey Public Schools - The New York Times,"In response to growing concern about the presence of lead in drinking water at schools, Gov. Chris Christie on Monday ordered mandatory testing for all New Jersey public schools. Under the plan, the state would provide $10 million to cover the cost of the testing in 3, 000 facilities, and the results would be posted by the school districts. “People need information so that they can feel safe,” Mr. Christie said at a news conference in Trenton. Lead awareness  —   and public anxiety  —   have been running high since dangerously elevated levels of lead were discovered in the water in Flint, Mich. where the city’s water supply was contaminated, with possibly devastating public health consequences, especially for children. In March, the continuing dangers of lead were driven home for New Jersey residents when water at 30 of Newark’s 67 schools was abruptly shut off because high levels of the metal had been discovered. Even as state and school officials sought to reassure nervous parents that they had the situation under control, there were questions about how the problem had been previously handled. New Jersey has been wrestling for decades with the best way to address concerns about lead exposure. In Camden, for instance, students in the school district have been drinking bottled water since 2002  —   a far cheaper response than tearing out swaths of lead piping. The decision about whether to test water for lead was left to individual school districts. Newark and Jersey City have long required testing in their schools. In early April, Mr. Christie said he wanted to act cautiously before mandating testing statewide. “Do we really want the state to be responsible for testing every faucet in every school in the entire state is, I think, a question really worthy of debate and discussion and not jumping to conclusions,” Mr. Christie, a Republican, said at the time. But on Monday, he said that it had become clear that the state needed to address the concern of parents who were hungry for information. “This is not about reporting to the state this is about reporting to the parents,” he said. “I think it is the right thing to do because there is public concern about it. ” Testing would begin before the next school year, with the Education Department working with the Environmental Protection and Health Departments to determine scientifically appropriate protocols for testing and responding to any elevated levels that are cause for concern. While replacing old pipes in places where elevated lead is found might be prohibitively expensive, Mr. Christie said, using bottled water, as in Camden, could prove a model for other districts. The governor also announced that the state would strengthen its response to lead exposure. Currently, New Jersey requires lead testing for all children ages 1 and 2. Mr. Christie said the state would lower the threshold of blood lead levels that would be a cause of concern  —   to between five and nine micrograms per deciliter of blood, from 10 micrograms  —   to match the most recent guidance of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",0
23080,Writer’s Strike Averted as Online Makes Big Hollywood Irrelevant - Breitbart,"The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) reached a tentative   contract deal on Tuesday as Big Hollywood relationships ave become increasingly irrelevant. [The Writers’ Guild of America’s union negotiating committee claimed it had made “gains in minimums across the board  —   as well as contribution increases to our Health Plan that should ensure its solvency for years to come. ” The union recommended that its 20, 000 brothers and sisters of the Los   Writers Guild of America West and   of Writers Guild of America East vote for the settlement.  The WGA has been a dominant figure in Hollywood business and politics for 50 years. The powerful union that could shut down productions, and cost hundreds of motion picture and television studio moguls millions of dollars, went on strike in 1960, 1981, 1986 and 2007 —  2008. But when the   WGAstruck studios for 100 days beginning in 2007, the 397 production companies played hard ball and stretched the strike out for 100 days. According to Deadline Hollywood, the AMPTP claimed that WGA members lost $287 million during the strike. Although the union disputes the size of the loss, and claims that 96. 3 percent of its members gave the union a strike authorization in April, WGA West financial statements reveal that 65 percent of the $2. 86 million in loans the union made to striking writers in   strike have still not been repaid. The WGA reported on its website that “we made gains in minimums across the board  —   as well as contribution increases to our Health Plan that should ensure its solvency for years to come. ” The union estimates that the settlement is worth $130 million more and provides enhanced “Options and Exclusivity” protections for its members, compared to the original AMPTP offer. WGA added that it “also made unprecedented gains” in obtaining a minimum of 2. 4 weeks of work for each short season television episode fee a 15 percent increase in pay TV residuals $15 million in increases in   subscription Video on Demand residuals pay TV   residuals and job protection on parental leave. A WGA West official told Variety, “The deal that we made is the art of the possible. We did the best we could. It’s got some important new things in it, and an important old thing: the health plan has been taken care of. ” The giant media companies appeared to be in a very strong contract negotiating position versus the writers’ union. But with the Pew Research Center reporting that 75 percent of cable   young people claiming they can watch what they want online, the media giants wanted to avoid a long strike that would make them more irrelevant, as creatively   media content increasingly becomes available on YouTube and Instagram.

23083,Obama: Obamacare Will Survive Trump - Breitbart,"Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” President Barack Obama said he thinks the Affordable Care Act will survive   Donald Trump’s tenure.

23085,"Transition Television, From PBS and CNN - The New York Times","This is just a guess, but the   programming that is all over television at the moment feels as if it might go largely unwatched. The offerings are generally some combination of   retrospective and       analysis. Do admirers of President Obama really want to revisit his slow slide from 2008 triumph to 2017 vilification? Do fans of the   Donald J. Trump, want to do anything other than say, “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out” and then plunge into their new opportunity? That said, let’s see if we can find any reason to watch two of this week’s programs: four hours’ worth of “Frontline” on PBS titled “Divided States of America,” and a CNN production, “The End: Inside the Last Days of the Obama White House. ” The “Frontline,” which is being broadcast in   chunks on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, is a rehashing of recent history that is for the most part all too familiar, a drumbeat of events that led to a government and a country defined by polarization. Large stretches of it aren’t particularly enlightening  —   who needs to relive the dreary, predictably acrimonious battles over budget stalemates and health care, or to hear sound bites of   radio stars fanning the flames of racism and hate? The structure of this trip down memory lane doesn’t make it any more palatable. Michael Kirk, who made the documentary, is largely content to let the usual talking heads be the guides  —   journalists, political operatives, lawmakers or former lawmakers. Some of them are from the same chattering class that failed to grasp the rise of Mr. Trump in the first place. Hindsight wisdom of this sort seems especially out of place now. As for the ordinary Americans who put Mr. Trump in the White House, we hear them mostly in   clips that only reinforce the easy stereotypes about them. Despite those criticisms, the program does manage to weave a convincing tapestry of discontent, and not just from the obvious threads. Have you forgotten, say, the odd 2009 incident in which Henry Louis Gates Jr. the Harvard scholar, who is black, was arrested after having to force his way into his own home because of a jammed door? This program hasn’t, and places it in the context of the growing schism that ultimately made Mr. Obama a divider rather than a uniter. So the documentary, though it’s not particularly rewarding to watch, does achieve its goal of painting a portrait of a country that is about as disunited as it could be, thanks to economic forces, increasingly unveiled racism and an anger that continues to be hard to pin down. President Obama’s early   pronouncement that the country isn’t a collection of red states and blue states, but is “and always will be the United States of America” is heard here. By the program’s end, it has never seemed more naïve. The CNN program, Wednesday night, is the better of the two, capturing a lot of honesty as it follows staff members in the Obama White House during their final days. It has partisan stretches, of course, but its most interesting passages are a study of what has to happen to transfer the government from one group of handlers to another, regardless of who is transferring to whom. To watch this program is to be impressed with the magnitude of what will happen this week. “It’s the largest takeover of any organization not only on the planet but in history,” says Max Stier of the Partnership for Public Service, an organization focused on improving government effectiveness. Then he notes why it’s especially important now. “The point of maximum vulnerability for our nation is at the transition,” he says, “and in a    world, doing this really well is vital. ”",0
23087,"In Refrigerators, Tomatoes Lose Flavor at the Genetic Level - The New York Times","The tomato hitching a ride home in your grocery bag today is not the tomato it used to be. No matter if you bought plum, cherry or heirloom, if you wanted the tastiest tomato, you should have picked it yourself and eaten it immediately. That’s because a tomato’s flavor  —   made up of sugars, acids and chemicals called volatiles  —   degrades as soon as it’s picked from the vine. There’s only one thing you can do now: Keep it out of the fridge. Researchers at The University of Florida have found in a study published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that when tomatoes are stored at the temperature kept in most refrigerators, irreversible genetic changes take place that erase some of their flavors forever. Harry J. Klee, a professor of horticultural sciences who led the study, and his colleagues took two varieties of tomatoes  —   an heirloom and a more common modern variety  —   and stored them at 41 degrees Fahrenheit before letting them recover at room temperature (68 degrees Fahrenheit). When they looked at what happened inside the tomatoes in cold temperatures, Dr. Klee said the subtropical fruit went into shock, producing especially damaging changes after a week of storage. After they were allowed to warm up, even for a day, some genes in the tomatoes that created its flavor volatiles had turned off and stayed off. It’s like a symphony: “Remove the violins and the woodwinds,” Dr. Klee wrote in an email. “You still have noise, but it’s not the same. Add back just the violins and it still isn’t right. You need that orchestra of 30 or more chemicals in the right balance to give you a good tomato. ” When you can get fresh tomatoes, Dr. Klee recommends storing them at room temperature, to preserve their flavor, and eating them within a week of bringing them home. If you see your grocer storing them at temperatures that are too cold, tell them not to, he says. But this research may seem mostly academic. The average American consumes nearly 20 pounds of fresh tomatoes a year. And despite researchers, industries and farmers all striving to create the tastiest tomatoes, there are some things we can’t yet control. After all, most of the tomatoes we eat out of season are plucked from their vines probably in Florida or Mexico, just as they started to ripen. They are sorted, sized, graded and packed into a box with other tomatoes, totaling 25 pounds. Then they stay in a humidity and   room (no less than 55 degrees Fahrenheit) and ingest ethylene, a gas to make them ripen, for two to four days before being transported on a   truck to a warehouse. There they are repackaged,   and shipped to your grocer. There, if demand is low or if there’s no room, they may be stored in a fridge, and by the time you get them, it’s been a week to ten days. “It’s probably never going to equal the one that matured in your backyard over the 80 or 90 days that you grew it, but it beats stone soup” said Reggie Brown, a manager at Florida Tomato Committee, which produces up to half of America’s fresh tomatoes in the winter. In cold months, should you endure a tomatoless diet? There are alternatives, says Dan Barber, chef at Blue Hill and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in New York, who has received multiple James Beard Awards. “My advice for consumers is don’t eat a tomato in the winter,” he said. “Make a tomato jam in the summer and store and preserve it. Use dried tomatoes from the store. Make a tomato ketchup and can it  —   you can have it for the whole winter. ”",0

23091,SHOCK: 15-Year-Old Document Explodes on Hillary… 21 Children Died,"SHOCK: 15-Year-Old Document Explodes on Hillary… 21 Children Died Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
It has been suggested that Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is perfectly OK with people dying if it furthers a particular agenda or serves to protect her own vested interests. 
By way of example we could easily point to the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, in which four Americans under the auspices of Clinton’s State Department were killed, or her staunch support for abortion , which has abruptly ended the lives of millions of innocent babies before they were even born. 
Now it has been alleged that Clinton may bear responsibility for the deaths of children who had already been born, 21 of them to be exact, who perished tragically in the massive inferno that enveloped the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993, according to David T. Hardy, an attorney and Waco expert writing for The American Thinker . 
Those who remember what happened in Waco will recall that there had been a long and intense standoff between dozens of members of a cult and federal authorities over alleged trafficking and possession of illegal firearms. 
That standoff ultimately degenerated into an all-out assault on the compound with armored vehicles, heavy weapons and copious amounts of tear gas, eventually starting a massive fire that burned the compound to the ground, killing 74 members of the group, including 21 children. 
That tragedy has been largely blamed on then-Attorney General Janet Reno, but there is some evidence to suggest that the order to assault the compound came from the Clinton White House, perhaps even from Hillary herself. 
One piece of evidence that may point to that conclusion is the transcript of the FBI’s interview with Lisa Foster following the death of her husband Vince, which was ruled a suicide.

23094,Sean Spicer Inaccurately Claims Paul Ryan’s Health Care Bill ’Fully’ Repeals Obamacare - Breitbart,"White House press secretary Sean Spicer falsely stated that the healthcare bill from House Speaker Paul Ryan represents what will eventually be a full repeal of Obamacare. Yet, the GOP bill —  which has been panned by many conservatives and dubbed “Obamacare 2. 0” —  keeps key elements of Obamacare in place.  When asked about this at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon by the Washington Examiner’s Sarah Westwood, Spicer inaccurately stated that if this bill were to be signed into law it would constitute a repeal of Obamacare. Repealing Obamacare was a top campaign promise made by President Donald Trump in 2016. “If this is the policy that passes, is President Trump confident in the future that he can say that he fully repealed Obamacare?” Westwood asked Spicer. “Yeah, absolutely, as I mentioned, I mean, the first half of the bill that we put forward repeals it,” Spicer replied. “There are three things, I mean, each phase that we’ve talked about —  phase one, phase two, and phase three —  there’s a repeal and replace aspect with each one. ” Yet, the bill proposed on Monday night certainly does not represent a full repeal of Obamacare. It has been called by conservative critics Obamacare 2. 0 because the bill keeps in place the Obamacare requirements that insurers allow for coverage of   conditions and allows children to stay on their parents’ health care until they’re   . It shifts the individual mandate from being a tax paid to the government to a penalty paid to insurance companies, does not even address the Medicaid issue in states effectively, helps illegal aliens access healthcare in the system, and it does not allow for purchasing of insurance across state lines as Republicans have promised for years —  among many, many other problems. Specifically on the Medicaid front, the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) says that the bill “misses the mark” in terms of rolling back the entitlement. FGA said in a release: Freezing enrollment in ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion is critical to protecting taxpayers and freeing up resources for the truly needy. This is a politically popular solution that would save taxpayers more than $600 billion over the next decade. Unfortunately, the current draft does not stop new states from expanding ObamaCare and does not freeze enrollment in existing expansions. The draft does not even give states the statutory authority to implement their own enrollment freezes. Spicer, reached by phone on Tuesday afternoon, told Breitbart News, “I don’t care” when told this bill does not constitute a full Obamacare repeal.  “I don’t care. Again, that’s your —  that’s not what the president thinks. That’s not what Tom Price thinks. That’s not what Mick Mulvaney thinks. So, say what you will, but that’s the reality of this,” Spicer said. When told that Tom Price, the Health and Human Services Secretary, actually did say the bill was not final —  and described it as a “work in progress” and not a final full repeal of Obamacare —  Spicer agreed with Secretary Price. “Right, it’s going through the process. It goes through regular order,” Spicer said. Spicer added, too, that the issues of things like dealing with Medicaid, the purchasing of insurance across state lines, and more will happen in future phases. “There are three phases to this,” Spicer said. “There are certain things we can do in phase one and certain things we can do in phase two and certain things we can do in phase three. ”",0
23098,Dozens Of Syrian Children Dead After Receiving Measles Vaccinations,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Baxter Dmitry in Middle East , News // 0 Comments 
At least 36 children are dead and over 50 suffering allergic reactions after receiving measles vaccinations under a UN-sponsored program in the rebel-held north of Syria. 
Doctors in clinics in the towns of Jirjanaz and Maaret al-Nouman in the northeastern province of Idlib said children started falling ill shortly after the vaccinations were administered. 
The mass vaccination drive was part of a high profile international effort to ensure the brutal civil war does not result in an outbreak of measles. 
Reports on the number of children vary and are expected to climb. Relief organizations just over the border in Turkey said the loss of life was extensive, rising as high as 36 plus more than a dozen other children in a life-threatening conditions. 
The Syrian rebel government, which controls the area of Idlib province and is attempting to oust Assad, had been administering the program with international support. They have since announced the immunization project has been stopped. 
Parents accused rebel government health authorities of failing to store the vaccines properly, and of supplying out-of-date medication. But opposition officials denied accusations of negligence, saying that the vaccines came from Unicef and WHO, and that the same batch had successfully vaccinated 60,000 schoolchildren in 30 locations in recent days. “It’s very bad. The figures of dead we are getting go into the 30s. Children are dying very quickly,” said Daher Zidan, the coordinator of the medical charity, Uossm. “We think it will get worse.” 
But the rebel government are blaming the Assad government. “ Primary investigations point to a limited security breach by vandals likely connected to the regime, which has been attempting to target the medical sector in Free Syria in order to spread chaos, ” the rebel ministry said in a statement. 
The WHO said it was urgently checking the reports and could not confirm the toll. Other well-followed Syrian monitoring groups said there had been deaths. 
“ At least 36 children have died and 50 others are suffering from poisoning or allergic reactions after measles vaccinations in Jirjanaz, in Idlib province ,” the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.",0
23104,Kathy Griffin in Tears at Press Conference: ’Trump Broke Me’ (Video),"Kathy Griffin held a press conference Friday morning to address her   shock photo of a “beheaded” President Donald Trump, telling reporters that the Trump family has tried to “ruin” her in the wake of the controversy and vowing to continue to make fun of the president. [Standing next to her attorney Lisa Bloom, the    My Life on the   star said the firestorm generated by the photograph  —   after which she was fired from CNN and had at least five scheduled performances cancelled  —   would have never occurred had the photograph been taken by a male artist.  “I don’t think I will have a career after this. I’m going to be honest, he broke me,” Griffin said as she began to choke up. “If you don’t stand up, you get run over,” she added. “What’s happening to me has never happened ever in the history of this great country. Which is that a sitting president of the United States and his grown children and the First Lady are personally, I feel, personally trying to ruin my life forever. ” “He picked me, I’m the easiest target,” she continued. (Watch: Press conference begins at the 40:22 mark) Griffin said the widespread backlash she has faced over the photo is part of a sexist campaign to destroy her career. “It’s a bunch of white guys trying to silence me,” she said. “This wouldn’t be happening to a guy. This is a woman thing. ” Griffin told reporters that the process of preparing for the photograph took just minutes, and was intended to be a parody of the president’s comments about former Fox News anchor Megan Kelly, when he said last year after a presidential debate that the anchor “had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her whatever. ” “I said let’s get in trouble, let’s give them something to talk about,” Griffin recalled, adding that she “never imagined it could be misinterpreted. ” During the press conference, Griffin was asked about a report that claimed Trump’s youngest son,    Barron Trump, was traumatized by the image after he saw it on television, because he did not know who Griffin was or the context in which the photograph was taken. “Allegedly” traumatized, Bloom replied. “You’re assuming everything the Trumps say is true. ” Griffin, for her part, said she “would never want to hurt anyone, especially a child. ” The comedian reiterated that she meant what she said in her apology video earlier this week, in which she said the image  —   taken by L. A.  photographer Tyler Shields, who has since defended the work  —   had gone “too far” and that she had “crossed a line. ” But Griffin added that she would continue to make fun of the president in the wake of the controversy. Another attorney for Griffin confirmed during the press conference that the Secret Service had opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Reaction to the press conference came swiftly on Twitter, as “Lisa Bloom” began trending on the social media platform Friday morning. Some observers said the press conference was not effective from a crisis management perspective. Lisa Bloom just failed the first rule of being an attorney: never take a question you don’t already know the answer to.  —   Emily Zanotti (@emzanotti) June 2, 2017,  So Kathy Griffin was a victim of sexism!

At this stage the motive for the stabbings is not clear. ( It will become crystal clear once you identify the attacker as a Muslim ) UK Daily Mail (h/t larr) The local police force confirmed the attack by Tweeting: ‘There was a knife assault at the #Hauptwache in #Frankfurt. ‘That’s why so many colleagues [police officers] and rescue workers there.’ Frankfurt Police confirmed all four victims were still in hospital. A video of the bloody aftermath was captured on what is understood to be level B of the station. The incident was at 5.30pm local time, according to Hessenschau , who report the stabbings came after a group were quarreling. A dispute had started on one platform and spilled over onto another one. There was more bloodshed in a separate incident at the station, understood to be on a passenger train between Hauptwache and Taunusanlage. A dispute between two passengers broke out into a fight, according to Hessenschau , which led to glass being broken and people suffering cuts. Frankfurt police looked to reassure the public by tweeting: “If we recognized a threat to the local population we would communicate this.” (No, you wouldn’t) The stabbings will still raise fears the attack was ISLAMIC terror-related after a string of incidents across Europe over recent months. Germany has been rocked by ISLAMIC terror attacks this year, heaping pressure on chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door MUSLIM immigration policy. A bloody week of violence that rocked Germany began on July 18 when Pakistani MUSLIM teenager Riaz Khan Ahmadzai, 17, posing as an Afghan refugee, hacked at passengers on a train in Wurzburg with an axe, wounding five. Four days later, a German-Iranian MUSLIM teenager Ali Sonboly shot nine people dead during a rampage through a shopping centre in Munich before taking his own life.

23111,Anti-Trump ‘Women’s March’ Celebrates Abortion-on-Demand,"Despite its lip service to “diversity,” the   “Women’s March on Washington” has turned out to be just another front for the abortion lobby, promoted by Planned Parenthood and its cronies. [Ostensibly organized to protest the election of Donald Trump, the march on January 21, 2017, will showcase the losing platform of Hillary Clinton, especially her dogged devotion to   .  While the march’s website claims that “we join in diversity” by “defending the most marginalized among us,” women who are   or defend traditional marriage and family fall outside the stated qualifications of those who wish to march and are not welcome. The “unity principles” that narrow the scope of the march specifically espouse “reproductive rights” and “LGBTQIA rights,” while omitting the rights to religious freedom or the fundamental right to life. “We believe in Reproductive Freedom,” the guidelines state. “This means open access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control for all people, regardless of income, location or education. ” “We must have the power to control our bodies and be free from gender norms, expectations and stereotypes,” it reads. Although organizers hail the event as a “grassroots effort,” in reality, it is a massive   choreographed assembly paid for by major donors such as George Soros and Planned Parenthood, “helmed by four national   and a national coordinating committee who are working around the clock to pull it all together. ” The list of “Partners” of the event reads like a who’s who of radical feminism, and includes Catholics for Choice, the Center for Reproductive Rights, The Coalition of Nasty Women, EMILY’s List, Free the Nipple, GLAAD, NARAL   America Foundation, National Abortion Federation, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Institute for Reproductive Health, Pussyhat Project, and, of course, Planned Parenthood. The usual Hollywood shills for the abortion lobby will also be out in full force. Planned Parenthood advocate Scarlett Johansson, for instance, announced, “I am marching on Washington to let our next president know that we, men and women alike, will not stand down or be silenced and will fight to protect our bodies and our choices. ” Actress Debra Messing of Will  Grace went further still, saying, “An attack on Planned Parenthood is an attack on all American women. ” Conspicuous by their absence will be the tens of millions of “American women” who believe in the right to life for all, including the unborn.

23115,"Stop Passing That Dumb Petition Around – Yes, That One","  
There’s a change.org petition being passed around by progressives right now — with 1.4 million signatures at the time of this writing — that asks the Electoral College to break historical precedent, ignore the laws in their respective states, face whatever political and legal consequences there may be (if an elector in a red state did that, they would and should fear for their lives. Think about it), and vote for Hillary Clinton despite the way the cards fell. It’s a dumb petition and you shouldn’t sign it. It’s never, never, ever going to happen that way. And furthermore, because of the way the numbers stack up, there are more Republican than Democratic electors — they want him elected. It’s never going to happen. 
Don’t get me wrong — I’m all for democratizing the presidential election process. Want the popular vote to pick the president? I’m right there with you . However, this petition isn’t going to accomplish that, and not so deep down, I think you know that. 
What it is going to do is make you feel a little bit better about not doing anything to actually make it happen. That’s all online petitions typically do, unless there is a pledge for personal action attached. That’s not the solution here — especially since there is a REAL solution to the problem of the electoral college on the table. The petition being passed around is going to make people feel complacent, and less likely to call a state legislator, which is the real way to go about this. The electoral college won’t stop this — in fact, the electoral college needs to go. 
There is a movement and bill in the works that binds individual states’ electors to casting electoral votes along with the national popular vote. All you need is enough states to agree to have 270 votes, and boom! Popular vote wins. No, it’s not going to make Hillary Clinton the president. It’s really too late for that. But instead of despair and pointless petitions, you should begin acting for the future you want, today. 
As I wrote for Addicting Info, 
Eleven states have already signed on to the National Popular Vote bill, which is an interstate compact agreeing to cast the votes of those states (165 in all) to whoever wins the popular vote in the general election. If more states sign on, specifically 105 votes’ worth, it’s decided — the popular vote will determine who wins the general election. 
If you live in California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, Washington, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Hawaii, or DC, your district is already on board with truly democratic elections. Although those states are mostly blue, not all of the legislative branches are, so there’s hope! 
If you do not live in one of those states, you can pressure your state legislators to pass a bill joining the cause. You can find the progress made in your state already at this link , or find out more behind the movement in general here . 
If you don’t like the fact that a Wyoming Republican’s vote counts for four times as much as a Democrat’s in California, see how far along your state is on accepting truly democratic elections. Don’t sign a dumb petition and then forget about it.

[The pilot, who showed up late to her flight wearing “street clothes,” spoke to passengers “over the intercom about her divorce and the presidential election,” the Daily Mail reported.  “Sorry I’m late, the reason I’m late is I’m going through a divorce,” she said. Some of the pilot’s comments made passengers feel uncomfortable, “causing them to question her ability to fly the plane. ” Passenger Randy Reiss said the pilot seemed friendly at first, “but things took an awkward turn when she pointed out an interracial couple sitting in first class. ” “It quickly turned from playful to scary,” Reiss told BuzzFeed News. Passengers said the pilot said that she was going to be on Oprah and then commented on the 2016 presidential election. “Look, I don’t care if you voted for Trump or Clinton, they’re both assholes,” she said. She also said she would let her   fly the plane because he is a man, and she told passengers they could disembark the plane if they didn’t feel safe. “So I’ll stop, and we’ll fly the plane.

23122,Electoral victory for Hillary already LOCKED IN via massive bribery…,"Wyoming (Wyo Stat SS22-19-108) 
As that same page writes: 
Over the years, however, despite legal oversight, a number of electors have violated their state’s law binding them to their pledged vote. However, these violators often only face being charged with a misdemeanor or a small fine, usually $1,000. Many constitutional scholars agree that electors remain free agents despite state laws and that, if challenged, such laws would be ruled unconstitutional. Therefore, electors can decline to cast their vote for a specific candidate (the one that wins the popular vote of their state), either voting for an alternative candidate, or abstaining completely. The same corrupt democrats that have rigged the debates, rigged the polls, rigged the news media and rigged the justice system are now about to STEAL the election through bribery of Electors 
Now it’s all becoming clear. Having failed to destroy Donald Trump despite the world’s most vicious barrage of lies and defamatory news slander, George Soros and the corrupt democrats have bribed enough Electors to “lock in” a victory for Hillary Clinton no matter what happens on election day . 
What you’re going to see the night of Nov. 8th, in other words, is a landslide popular vote victory for Donald Trump , immediately followed by electoral votes handing the official election victory to Hillary Clinton. 
The theft of the presidency will be achieved thusly. And as you might expect, the American people are going to REVOLT en masse. We the People will not accept the theft of power and the nullification of democracy 
We the People will not accept the theft of power by a corrupt, criminal regime run by deceptive leftists who lie, cheat and steal their way to power at every election. The bribery of Electors is, of course, the nullification of democracy in America , since it means wealthy globalists can simply buy off the electoral votes and put anyone they want into the White House… the voters be damned. 
When the American people realize their votes have just been nullified through massive bribery and corruption, they are going to revolt like we’ve never seen before. They will take to the streets in protest, and the greater the margin of victory in the popular vote by Donald Trump, the more angry the voters are going to be. 
We have quite simply reached the point in American history where the people will no longer tolerate the theft of power and massive election fraud that’s now routinely pursued by democrats (and especially Clinton operatives). If this election is stolen by George Soros via the bribery of Electors, I anticipate a full-on revolt where the military, the police and the citizens storm Washington and depose the corrupt Obama / Clinton regime and install the proper election winner as President. That would be Donald J. Trump, of course. 
Frankly, We the People have every right to demand that democracy be restored . It is time to take America back from the thieving, lying commie bastards running the democrat party today.",0
23124,Dem. Assemblyman Pushes Bill to Guarantee Teachers Cannot Shoot Back if Attackers Strike - Breitbart,"California Assemblyman Kevin McCarty ( ) is pushing legislation to take away school administrators’ power to allow teachers with a Carry Concealed Weapon license (CCW) to be armed in classrooms for  . [McCarty’s bill —  AB 424 —  was introduced months ago and is snaking its way through the legislative process.  He introduced the bill on February 13 and in   Bakersfield. com reported that it was being pushed as a way “of closing a loophole in the Gun Free School Zone Act. That act, also known as SB 707, barred firearms on school grounds, but made exceptions for anyone granted permission by local superintendents. ” AB 424 would take away superintendents’ powers to allow teachers with CCW’s to be armed for  . Gun Owners of California’s Sam Peredes talked to Breitbart News on May 12 and said, “Two years ago, California passed a bill saying a concealed carry permit holder could not carry on any school campus unless they had the authorization of the school administrator. Well, out of the one thousand school districts in California, five of them decided to allow concealed permit holders to carry on their campuses. That so ticked off the legislature that now they are going to take away the authority of even administrators to allow CCW holders to carry on their campuses. ” Breitbart News previously reported that that five school districts which chose to allow CCW holders to carry on campus for   are Kern High School District, Kingsburg Joint Union High School District, Folsom Cordova Unified School District, Anderson Union High School District, and Palo Cedro’s North Cow Creek School District, McCarty justified his push to disarm teachers, saying, “A safe learning environment is essential for our children to be successful in the classroom. That’s not possible if a school district allows armed civilians to roam California school campuses. ” Missing from McCarty’s appraisal is the fact that Sandy Hook Elementary was a safe learning environment until a mass attacker ignored the   zone signage, and once he was in the building no one was armed to stop him. McCarty and other Democrats must realize that attackers who refuse to heed a “gun free zone” sign will have no one to stop them once the teachers and staff are disarmed in California either.

23127,Berlin Election Deals Angela Merkel’s Party Another Blow - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party suffered the latest in a string of defeats in German state elections on Sunday, when her Christian Democratic Union was ousted from power in Berlin after its worst showing in the capital since World War II, according to preliminary results. Voters in Berlin turned out in higher numbers than in previous years, many responding to voter mobilization calls from the   Alternative for Germany party. The party is now poised to enter the  ’s legislature for the first time, although its share of the vote, 14. 2 percent in the preliminary results, was less than what it was two weeks ago in Ms. Merkel’s home state,   where it placed second. Ms. Merkel’s party won 17. 6 percent of the vote in Berlin, not enough to allow it to continue as the junior partner in a governing coalition with the Social Democrats. The   Social Democratic Party earned 21. 6 percent of the vote and is expected to form a government with two other parties: the Left Party, with 15. 6 percent, and the Greens, with 15. 2. “We are all angry that the AfD got in,” Michael Müller, Berlin’s mayor and the Social Democrats’ leading candidate, told cheering supporters in the capital, referring to the Alternative for Germany party. “But I can assure you that Berlin will remain an international city, open to the world. ” The result proved that the Alternative for Germany party is not as popular in Berlin as it is elsewhere, but it managed to draw considerable support, mostly from the city’s eastern districts. It campaigned hard against the chancellor’s decision last year to allow more than one million migrants into the country. Berlin is the 10th state in which the party has earned representation, and with little more than a year to go before the 2017 general election, the party appears to be gaining enough strength to earn seats in the national Parliament. Some commentators viewed the result as a chance for a rebirth of Germany’s struggling traditional parties and its overall democracy. “The success of the Alternative for Germany is a   call that it can’t be taken for granted that society is liberal and will remain so,” Heribert Prantl, a journalist at the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, wrote in a commentary. “Nor can it be taken for granted that minorities (and not only the refugees) are and will be respected. ” Many former supporters of the chancellor’s party drifted to the liberal Free Democratic Party, which voters returned to the state legislature with about 6 percent of the vote after it was ousted in the 2011 election. But the upstart Pirate Party, which won seats in the state Parliament in 2011, was voted out. Ms. Merkel, who governs on the national level in a coalition with the Social Democrats, had blamed Mr. Müller, the   mayor, for refusing to be held accountable for the chaotic circumstances faced by the 79, 000 refugees who arrived last year in the capital. “Based on my own experience, I know that leaders of government are always responsible, and they will be made responsible,” the chancellor said in an interview with the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel before the vote. Yet many in Ms. Merkel’s own conservative bloc have criticized her for allowing the refugee influx to become a crisis. Horst Seehofer, the leader of a Bavarian sister party to Ms. Merkel’s conservatives, has been among her loudest critics. In an interview released Friday, Mr. Seehofer threatened to withhold his party’s support for her in the 2017 election unless she agreed to set a limit on the number of new refugees to be admitted. Frank Henkel, the leading candidate for Ms. Merkel’s party in Berlin, blamed squabbling for the party’s poor showing in Berlin, saying the infighting had alienated voters and led them to question the bloc’s ability to govern.",0

As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton routinely asked her maid to print out sensitive government e-mails and documents — including ones containing classified information — from her house in Washington, DC, e-mails and FBI memos show. But the housekeeper lacked the security clearance to handle such material.
In fact, Marina Santos was called on so frequently to receive e-mails that she may hold the secrets to E-mailgate — if only the FBI and Congress would subpoena her and the equipment she used.
Clinton entrusted far more than the care of her DC residence, known as Whitehaven, to Maria Santos who is a Filipina immigrant. She expected the Filipino immigrant to handle state secrets, further opening the Democratic presidential nominee to criticism that she played fast and loose with national security.
Clinton would first receive highly sensitive e-mails from top aides at the State Department and then request that they, in turn, forward the messages and any attached documents to Santos to print out for her at the home.

23137,US Insiders – Not Russia – Leaked Clinton Emails,"Posted on November 2, 2016 by WashingtonsBlog 
We’ve repeatedly shown that it’s much more likely that American insiders – not Russian hackers – leaked the Clinton emails. 
Today, the NSA executive who created the agency’s mass surveillance program for digital information, who served as the senior technical director within the agency, who managed six thousand NSA employees, the 36-year NSA veteran widely regarded as a “legend” within the agency and the NSA’s best-ever analyst and code-breaker, who mapped out the Soviet command-and-control structure before anyone else knew how, and so predicted Soviet invasions before they happened (“in the 1970s, he decrypted the Soviet Union’s command system, which provided the US and its allies with real-time surveillance of all Soviet troop movements and Russian atomic weapons”) – told Washington’s Blog: 
My vote all along has been on an insider passing all these emails to Wikileaks. 
If it were the Russians, NSA would have a trace route to them and not equivocate on who did it. It’s like using “Trace Route” to map the path of all the packets on the network. In the program Treasuremap NSA has hundreds of trace route programs embedded in switches in Europe and hundreds more around the world. So, this set-up should have detected where the packets went and when they went there. 
Binney has previously explained to us that a Russian hack would have looked very different, and that he thought the hack may have been conducted by an NSA employee who was upset at Clinton’s careless handling of America’s most sensitive intelligence. 
The former intelligence analyst, British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, and chancellor of the University of Dundee (Craig Murray) – who is close friends with Wikileaks’ Julian Assange – said he knows with 100% certainty that the Russians aren’t behind the leaks. 
Murray said today: 
“The source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with Russia at all. I discovered what the source was when I attended [a] whistleblower award in Washington. The source of these emails comes from within official circles in Washington DC. You should look to Washington not to Moscow .” 
Prominent investment advisor and economic forecaster Martin Armstrong writes today: 
All our indications from behind the curtain are suggesting that there are many within the “intelligence” sector and “law enforcement” sector who are deeply troubled with the Clintons. They are trying to release documents and info to stop the Clinton Inc. Machine. That’s all we can say on this topic right now. Suffice it to say, there is a real internal battle going on in Washington. 
And the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under numerous administrations – both Democratic and Republican – (Steve Pieczenik ) said recently that a group of officers from various U.S. intelligence and military agencies have staged a “counter-coup” to save America from corruption, and are the source of the leaked emails:

23142,Misdemeanor Charge Against White House Adviser Gorka Dismissed,"ARLINGTON, Virginia  —   The chief judge of Arlington County’s Circuit Court in Virginia dismissed a misdemeanor charge that Dr. Sebastian Gorka, White House deputy assistant and former Breitbart News national security editor, had been facing for taking a legally owned unloaded gun through a TSA checkpoint at Reagan National Airport last year. [“Dr. Gorka made a mistake. He started carrying a licensed, concealed weapon after he got death threats against his family,” his lawyer, Christopher Oprison, told reporters.  “He regrets that mistake. Dr. Gorka wants to put this matter behind him and get back to the very important national security work he’s doing,” added the attorney. Chief Circuit Court Judge William Newman, Jr. dropped the charge under an agreement that resulted in no conviction for Dr. Gorka after he stayed out of trouble for six months and paid a nominal fine. The court never imposed a sentence on Gorka and, therefore, there was no conviction, explained Dr. Gorka’s attorney. The attorney suggested that the charge did not affect his client’s national security clearance. TSA agents allowed Gorka to board his plane after the agency’s   machine detected the unloaded weapon on January 1, 2016, when Gorka was traveling at the behest of the Pentagon to give a briefing on the Islamic State ( ) at U. S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) headquarters in Florida. Speaking on behalf of Gorka, his lawyer thanked TSA agents for keeping the nation safe. During the final adjudication hearing of the case Friday, Judge Newman declared that “the court is moving to dismiss the case. ” Gorka had not been required to attend, according to the judge. The judge and the Commonwealth attorney’s office acknowledged that Gorka fulfilled all the court’s instructions. Death threats against himself and his family prompted Dr. Gorka to regularly attend the shooting range and carry his gun for which he has a concealed carry permit. He explained that when he was on his way to Reagan National, he accidentally grabbed the bag he takes to the range, which contained an unloaded 9mm. The TSA   machine detected the weapon. After showing a TSA agent his U. S. Department of Defense identification card, he was issued a fine but was allowed to board his flight. He was also ordered to appear in court in Arlington County, and county law enforcement later confiscated his weapon.",0

23153,Watchdog Alleges Virginia Prepping for Mass Fraud…,"Posted 10/31/2016 3:41 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Officials stockpile a million provisional ballots in swing state governed by a close Clinton ally 

Virginia has printed 1 million provisional ballots, an unprecedented number that could allow a large number of previously disqualified felons to cast ballots for president in the potentially crucial swing state. 

So says Reagan George, the president of the Virginia Voters Alliance. 

George, a conservative election watchdog, charged on Monday that the Virginia Department of Elections is overpreparing for worst-case scenarios and increasing the likelihood of illegal votes being cast. In reply to Republican complaints earlier this month, Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortés acknowledged officials are preparing for all contingencies, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 

But George said the provisional ballot printing doesn’t make sense even for contingencies. And it doesn’t compare to demand in 2012. 

“The claim that it is for contingency planning is bogus,” George said in an email. “In 2012, Stafford County used less than 500 provisional ballots — in 2016 they received 30,000. In 2012, Loudoun County used 700 provisional ballots. In 2016, they received 84,000. In 2012, Fairfax used 2,500 provisional ballots; in 2016, they received over 265,000. This is ridiculous.” 
But spokeswoman Dena Potter of the Virginia Department of Elections said the state is trying to accommodate a court order. 

“As part of its emergency preparedness efforts and in response to the [December] 2015 consent decree related to mitigating long lines at the polls, the Department issued guidance to local registrars on August 29, 2016, that included having enough provisional ballot envelopes to equal at least 20 percent of the number of active voters as of September 1,” Potter said in an email. “As of September 30, there were 5.5 million voters registered in Virginia. As with any contingency planning, we hope that we don’t have to use these but they will be available in case we do.” 

The decision to print so many provisional ballots comes after an April announcement by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and a key ally of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. McAuliffe said he would allow more than 200,000 released felons to vote on Nov. 8. 

The decision immediately brought a legal challenge from the Republicans, who won their suit in July. Virginia law says the governor must individually clear such cases, and cannot widely add so many released felons back to the voter rolls. 

George believes the court loss is part of the thinking behind the surge in provisional ballots. The thousands of felons who signed up to vote after McAuliffe’s order were initially welcomed to the voter rolls. George said left-wing voter groups were ready for the order, and signed up thousands of felons within hours. 

If those felons now walk into a polling place and demand a ballot, they will be accommodated, George charged. George also said he is concerned other ineligible voters will be handed such provisional ballots simply if they demand them. 
Provisional ballots are only counted by city and county election boards after Nov. 8, and Republicans should be prepared for things to go against them, George said. Each board has a Republican and a Democrat, and an McAuliffe appointee. 

“Guess which way the vote is going to go,” said George. 

Virginia leaders have been dealing with election headaches for months. On Oct. 13, Virginia legislators questioned Cortes at a hearing. One Republican leader, citing election problems, called for Cortés to resign, according to the Times-Dispatch. 

“I think it’s incumbent upon the governor to replace you quickly with competent and nonpartisan leadership,” said Delegate Timothy Hugo, R-Fairfax.",0
23157,Scientists believe they have found ET,"Scientists believe they have found ET Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
Scientists have heard hugely unusual messages from deep in space that they think are coming from aliens, reports the Independent . 
A new analysis of strange modulations in a tiny set of stars appears to indicate that it could be coming from extraterrestrial intelligence that is looking to alert us to their existence. 
The new study reports the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 2.5 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky. The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely. 
And there appears to be no obvious explanation for what is going on, leaving the scientists behind the paper to conclude that the messages are coming from aliens. 
“We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,” write EF Borra and E Trottier in a new paper. “The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis,” the two scientists from Laval University in Quebec write. 
The research has appeaed in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, under the title ‘Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars’. It appears

The election of President Trump is not just a victory for orange people everywhere but an overwhelming mandate for those in the wall-building industry or Muslims who never wanted to visit the US. At last Americans can ‘grab pussies’ with impunity and give global warming the chance it deserves. 
With a sympathetic House and Supreme Court, Trump looks set to secure his vision of a gun in every cereal box, deporting California and ‘waterboarding for fun’. The US itself will naturally be rebranded as ‘Trump States™’; with a topless golf resort covering most of the mid-west. This will be followed by criminal charges against Hilary Clinton, Megan ‘Fox’ Kelly and all menstruators refusing to compete in his compulsory swimwear contest. 
Trump promised to unify a deeply divided country by imprisoning all pollsters – a decision warmly greeted by a confused electorate. In his first few days he is expected to repeal Obama-care, replacing it with the less socially inclusive ‘Who Cares?’ He will also eliminate debt, cut taxes and increase military spending – by simply redefining basic arithmetic. 
With Brexit now a dumb and distant memory, US voters confirmed that there is something worse than an Adam Sandler movie. Many await to see if Trump will keep his grandiose promises – such as free Trump-Steak for all, an end to billionaire-shaming and his long term commitment to ‘teabaging’ the Chinese President.

23171,Special Counsel Will Oversee Russia Investigation - Breitbart,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein installed George W.     Director Robert Mueller as special counsel Wednesday to oversee the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. [Because Attorney General Jeff Sessions previously recused himself from the investigation, Rosenstein is acting  Attorney General, with all the powers that entails, for purposes of the Russia probe. As such, Rosenstein has full authority to unilaterally pass responsibility off to Mueller, who will continue the already   investigation without reporting through the normal FBI and DOJ   .  Rosenstein’s decision came after Washington exploded into speculation Tuesday over the New York Times report that a “Comey Memo” showed that President Donald Trump had suggested in a private conversation that    Director James Comey “let it go” with regard to   National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Rosenstein explained in the press release accompanying the appointment that “unique circumstances” led to his determination that the appointment of a special counsel was in the public interest: My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted.  I have made no such determination.  What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command. Mueller served a full 10 year term as head of the FBI under both Presidents Bush and Barack Obama, in the immediate aftermath of the September 11th attacks. According to his order of appointment, Mueller’s purview will include all FBI investigation into: (i) any links   coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump and( ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation and( iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.

23172,Bruce Springsteen’s Archive Is Headed to Monmouth University - The New York Times,"There really could be only one appropriate home for Bruce Springsteen’s archives: the Jersey Shore. And indeed that is where they will go, through a partnership announced Tuesday with Monmouth University in West Long Branch, N. J. As part of the partnership, the university will establish the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music, which will be the repository for Mr. Springsteen’s personal collection of written works, photographs, periodicals and various artifacts from throughout his career. The university  —   just miles from Asbury Park, one of the towns where Mr. Springsteen started his musical career  —   said in a statement that the new center would promote the legacy of Mr. Springsteen and other giants of American music, like Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson. Its materials would also bolster curriculums at the university, including at its music business program. “The establishment of the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music celebrates and reinforces the Jersey Shore’s legacy in the history of American music, while providing a truly transformative experience for our students,” Paul R. Brown, the university’s president, said in a statement. The university offered few other details about the collection or its plans for the new center, including any financial information about the partnership. But Mr. Springsteen’s materials will join what is already a major trove of memorabilia at Monmouth, the Bruce Springsteen Special Collection. That collection includes nearly 35, 000 items  —   compiled in part by fans  —   which has been housed at Monmouth since 2011. One of the figures involved in bringing the archives to Monmouth University was Robert Santelli, the executive director of the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, who is expected to take on a leadership role at the new center. Mr. Santelli, a Monmouth alumnus, also helped secure the special collection for the university in 2011. The arrangement with Monmouth comes as   archives have become increasingly valuable to museums, universities and other cultural institutions, which use them for scholarly study and sometimes as tourist attractions. Last year, Bob Dylan’s archives were acquired by the George Kaiser Family Foundation for a group of institutions in Oklahoma, including the University of Tulsa, for an estimated $15 million to $20 million.",0

23178,Report: How to Listen to and Delete Every Voice Recording Saved by Amazon Echo - Breitbart,"Amazon’s artificial   home assistant Amazon Echo records every voice command you give to it. Here’s how you can listen to and delete everything your device has recorded. [“Is Amazon Echo always listening? The short answer is yes,” declared Fox News Tech. “I’m guessing most people don’t know this, but  —   surprise!  —   you can listen to every command you’ve ever given your Echo with the Alexa app on your smartphone or tablet. ”  “When I did, I was surprised to learn that some of my recordings had nothing to do with commands,” Fox News’ Kim Komando reported, explaining that “There I was talking on my phone about the old studios I was selling. Alexa also recorded portions of a presidential debate. I am not sure why my real estate call was recorded, but one of the candidates almost said the word ‘Alexa. ’” So how do you find and delete Amazon Echo’s recordings? If you’d like to review your old recordings, open the Alexa app, tap on the Settings menu and then tap on History. Given the hundreds or thousands of commands most Echo users accumulate, you’ll find a huge catalog of your requests. Select the recording you’d like to review and tap the Play icon to listen to it. If it creeps you out that your requests and other things you may have said have been stored in a database, you can delete them. Here’s how: * Open the Alexa app and go into Settings. * Select History and you’ll see a list of all the entries. * Select an entry and tap the Delete button. But what if you want to delete all your recordings? Do you have to remove each one manually? That could take days! Amazon lets you remove everything with one click. Just visit the “Manage Your Content and Devices” at www. amazon. . But keep in mind Amazon’s warning that “deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. ” Fox News Tech also explain in their article how you can stop Amazon Echo from listening to you altogether. Last month, a video of Amazon Echo turning off upon being asked about its ties to the C. I.

23179,"Arianna Huffington, journalist: echo chamber for Hillary Clinton","Leave a reply 
Jon Rappoport – Arianna Stassinopoulos, aka Huffington, is a Greek bearing gifts. For Hillary Clinton. 
The Huffington Post pretends it’s doing objective journalism. Nice try. No one has believed in HuffPo’s objectivity for a long time. But now we have an email that seals the deal. 
Zero Hedge reports : “…the latest Podesta dump from WikiLeaks fully exposes the blatant collusion in black and white. In the following email chain, when asked whether she would like to join the board of a pro-democrat media consortium, PMUSA, Ariana graciously declines saying that she could be more useful to the Clinton campaign by pushing its agenda through the Huffington Post “without any perceived conflicts”. “She [Arianna] is enthusiastic abt the project but asks if she’s more useful to us not being on the Board and, instead, using Huffpo to echo our [pro-Hillary] message without any perceived conflicts. She has a point.” “The sender of the email is none other than Susan McCue, the former chief of staff to [Democrat Senator] Harry Reid while the recipients include John Podesta [Hillary’s campaign chairman] and the ever controversial David Brock whose Super PAC, Correct the Record, has been sued for illegally coordinating with the Clinton campaign.” 
Well, isn’t that wonderful. 
Arianna used to be married to Republican Congressman Michael Huffington. Then, she was a political conservative. After her divorce, from which she reportedly netted $25 million, she began to morph into a Progressive. With the financial ability to launch HuffPo, she kept on turning to the political Left. In the HuffPo merger with AOL, she came away with another $21 million. 
Her opponents have pinned several labels on her: “the most upwardly mobile Greek since Icarus,” and “the Sir Edmund Hillary of social climbing.” 
So now she’s an echo chamber for the Democratic Party. 
The Online Etymology Dictionary traces the root of “echo”: “…personified in classical [Greek] mythology as a mountain nymph who pined away for love of Narcissus until nothing was left of her but her voice…” 
And now we’ve confirmed for whom that Arianna-voice speaks. A great American narcissist, Hillary Clinton.

23180,Gender-Bending Berkeley Murder Suspect Wants to be Referred to as ’They’ - Breitbart,"Pablo Gomez, Jr. a   Berkeley student activist arrested in January for allegedly stabbing a popular French elementary school teacher to death, and severely injuring another woman, insists on being referred to as “they. ”[Gomez’s preference to be called “they” and “them” as opposed to “he” has been “sucked up into the debate over gender identity,” according to the Associated Press.  The incident has reportedly   talks surrounding the use of gender pronouns, particularly in a city seen as the bastion of liberalism and progressive   in America. Emile Inman, 27, was reportedly found dead in her home this past January after allegedly being stabbed by Gomez, Jr. Another woman, Kiana Schmitt, 24, was rushed to the hospital after Gomez allegedly stabbed her hours earlier. However, Berkeleyside, which first reported on Gomez’s pronoun preference, began referring to the   campus activists as “they” and “them” once the publication learned of that preference from one of his friends. Berkeleyside updated its January 6 article to read, “According to Gomez Jr. ’s Facebook page, they are a UC Berkeley student who lives in Berkeley. [A friend contacted Berkeleyside after publication to say that Gomez Jr. uses the pronoun “they. ” This story has been updated. ]” Popular conservative columnist Ann Coulter reacted to Berkeleyside’s decision to satisfy the murderer’s pronoun request over social media: Berkeley student arrested https:  . .  Article calls Gomez ”they.” Did newspapers call John Hinkley ”Jodi Foster’s boyfriend”?  —   Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) January 8, 2017,  The AP reported, “After Raguso’s report, conservative commentator Ann Coulter ridiculed the pronoun change and mocked Gomez’s activist background. Breitbart. com and other conservative political websites picked up the story. ” Breitbart’s article can be found here. Frances Dinkelspiel,   of Berkeleyside, told Heat Street, “We decided to use ‘they’ for Pablo Gomez Jr because that is Gomez’s preferred gender pronoun. It’s as simple as that. We have used ‘they’ in other stories about    people. ” Similarly, Heat Street pointed out that Andrea Platten, managing editor of the Daily Californian, also adopted “they” as a singular pronoun at the publication last February. “We believe that any person’s preferred pronoun should be honored, regardless of whether they are accused of committing a crime,” Platten told Heat Street. Not everyone agreed that Gomez should have the right to decide which pronoun is used to describe him. “I think you give away your right to make a demand like that when you are arrested for killing somebody,” UC Berkeley junior and College Republicans member Jonothan Chow told the AP.

Speaking to the press at the meeting, Trump said that every president should have the right to block people from certain areas in the world, calling it a “common sense” decision for national security.

23183,Does Hillary Clinton Already Know The Results Of The Election?,"We Are Change 

Hillary Clinton’s election night fireworks have reportedly been cancelled, after reports surfaced last week that she was already planning her victory celebration for Tuesday night.
A report from the New York Post claimed that law enforcement and fire department officials in New York City were being prepped for a “barge-launched pyrotechnic display off Manhattan’s Javits Center, where Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine will join their supporters for the Nov. 8 vote count.” The show was planned for 9:30 p.m. EDT, half an hour after the polls close.
While the Jacob K. Javits Center where Clinton is hosting the event has a symbolic glass ceiling , it is also important to note that the company she is reportedly using for the fireworks display is Garden State Fireworks. The same company produced the fireworks special for the grand opening of the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ, in 2007.
Former Republican nominee Mitt Romney made similar plans in 2012. According to a report from the Daily Caller, the Romney campaign planned “an eight-minute, $25,000 fireworks show over Boston Harbor to celebrate a victory over Barack Obama that never happened.” 
Report of Clinton’s celebration drew criticism on Twitter, with some users resurrecting calls of a rigged election:

“They do have a permit for fireworks, but at this point we believe the fireworks is canceled,” Galati said.
When asked what the reason was behind the cancellation, Galati said, “I cannot tell you that.”

23185,Moms Demand Action Founder: Trump is ’NRA’s Dream’ but America’s Nightmare - Breitbart,"Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts suggested President Donald Trump’s   administration is the ‘NRA’s Dream’ but America’s nightmare Sunday, during an appearance MSNBC. [She was especially concerned about the push for “concealed carry reciprocity,” which she described as “extremely dangerous. ”  For anyone not familiar with national reciprocity for concealed carry, the goal is to replace the current patchwork of concealed carry laws with a recognition that a concealed permit from one state is valid in every state. This would allow concealed permit holders to drive from one state to the next and keep their handgun with them for   just as they do in their home state. This is what Watts described as “extremely dangerous. ” She said national reciprocity is “the NRA’s dream but it is a nightmare for public safety. ” She did not provide any data substantiating her suggestion that concealed carry permit holders endanger public safety. Watts also mentioned “silencer legislation” and “talk of executive orders to put guns in schools. ” She then spoke to the fact that President Trump will be speaking at the NRA’s Annual Meetings on April 28, and said, “I would like to see Donald Trump say something about where he stands on these dangerous laws. ” It is important to note that Trump actually led the charge for national reciprocity during his presidential campaign, so there is no need for him to clarify his stance. On September 18, 2015, Breitbart News quoted Trump: The right of   doesn’t stop at the end of your driveway. That’s why I have a concealed carry permit and why tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver’s license works in every state, so it’s common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state. If we can do that for driving  —   which is a privilege, not a right  —   then surely we can do that for concealed carry, which is a right, not a privilege. Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. also spoke plainly during the campaign when he explained that his father would support firearm suppressor deregulation. And Trump was very clear in numerous statements about the dangers posed by   zones, like the ones at Orlando Pulse (June 12, 2106) Umpqua Community College (October 1, 2015) and Sandy Hook Elementary (December 14, 2012). In fact, following the Umpqua Community College attack, The Hill quoted Trump saying, “I’ll tell you, if you had a couple of the teachers or someone with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off. ” On April 16, Breitbart News reported Watts’ claim that “caring Americans” support gun control.

23189,"Dying out: Wild animal numbers could fall by 67% from 1970-2020, study says","RT October 27, 2016 
The number of wild animals on Earth could fall by more than two-thirds in the 50 years to 2020, according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats, hunting and pollution. The forecast could lead to major consequences for humans. 
The Living Planet Report 2016 says that animal losses are on track to reach 67 percent in the 50 years to 2020. The report’s authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline, citing a 58 percent plummet between 1970 and 2012. 
The researchers analyzed the changing presence of 14,152 monitored populations of the 3,706 vertebrate species – mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles among them. 
According to the paper, the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging. Pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem. Vaccine-laden M&M’s to be distributed via drone for endangered ferrets https://t.co/wm4DUucNxn pic.twitter.com/9a6F9x3raG 
“Humanity’s misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats, pushing irreplaceable species to the brink, and threatening the stability of our climate,” said WWF’s director of science, Mike Barrett. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Animals across the planet are expected to be affected. However, rivers and lakes are the hardest-hit areas. Barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures. 
“We are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,” the Stockholm Resilience Center’s Professor Johan Rockström said in a foreword for the report. 
The decline in wildlife, along with climate change, is part of the proposed notion of Anthropocene, a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on Earth’s geology and ecosystems. 
The notion – which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time – can lead to major consequences. 
“The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse,” WWF Director-General Marco Lambertini said, as quoted by the Guardian. 
In fact, the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition, noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition. 
“Increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources,” the report states. 
There does, however, appear to be some hope. Some species are beginning to recover, suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis. 
However, Barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place, society must largely change how it consumes resources. 
“You’d like to think that was a no-brainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business,” Barrett said. 
“The report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are,” he added. “My hope though is that we don’t throw our hands up in despair – there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it.” 
The new report comes less than two months after a similar analysis found that Earth has lost one-tenth of its wilderness sites since the early 1990s.   6:41  ",0

Republican Donald Trump has never been good at controlling his anger, and the same goes for his insane jealousy. 
Last night, Jay Z and Beyonce shared the stage with Hillary Clinton at a concert in Cleveland, Ohio. The A-list couple showed Clinton a stunning amount of support, followed by a powerful speech by the Democratic candidate herself. It was a monumental moment, and Trump hated every second of it. 
At a rally of his own, Trump couldn’t hide the fact that he was green with envy. Trump said: 
“We’re going to do it, folks. We’re going to do it. Oh boy, are we going to win Pennsylvania big. Look at this. I hear we set a new record for this building. And by the way, I didn’t have to bring J Lo or Jay Z, the only way she gets anybody. I’m here all by myself. I am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar, no piano, no nothing.” 
Trump didn’t even try to hide how sorry he felt for himself, and it was obvious that he was trying really hard not to completely lose it over the fact that no one likes him and almost no celebrities want to be affiliated with him. You can watch Trump give his pathetic, desperate speech below: 
Trump’s bullsh*t campaign is finally coming to an end. He spent the beginning of his campaign promising America that he’d run a star-studded campaign, and he has almost nothing to show for it almost a year later. Not even his own Republican colleagues wanted to appear with him on the campaign trail, forcing Trump to go it alone. 
Of course Trump is jealous and bitter. While Clinton doesn’t need the support of the massive amount of celebrities who have endorsed her, their support is a clear sign that she is doing something right and her campaign is something worth standing by.

23191,College Marching Band Takes Heat for Playing Trump Inauguration,"The marching band of Talladega College, Alabama’s oldest private historically black college, is set to perform at   Donald Trump’s inauguration, causing outrage and backlash from some of the school’s former students. [“We were a bit horrified to hear of the invitation,” Talladega alumni Shirley Ferrill told the Associated Press. “I don’t want my alma mater to give the appearance of supporting him. Ignore, decline or whatever, but please don’t send our band out in our name to do that. ”  The Presidential Inaugural Committee announced the news Friday that some 40 groups, including high school bands and military organizations, were accepted to perform in the inaugural parade. Talladega College Marching Tornadoes’ decision to perform at the prestigious event quickly consumed the college’s social media sites. “The news that Talladega College has forgotten its steady and proud 150 years of history, by making the decision to not stand in solidarity with other   and courageous people, academic institutions, and organizations, protesting the inauguration of one of the most antagonistic,   unrepentant racists, has simply and unequivocally broken my heart today,” wrote Nikky Finney, a 1979 graduate of Talladega, who’s now chair of creative writing and southern studies at the University of South Carolina. “This should have been a teachable moment for the President of Talladega College instead it has become a moment of divisiveness and shame,” Finney wrote. There were some who applauded Talladega’s decision. “It’s a Presidential Inauguration, a high profile event. It’s a great experience for the band,” one user wrote on the popular marching band online message board bandhead. org. “Some of you have got this all wrong,” another user wrote. “You all were wrong about the Presidential Election and you are wrong about Talladega. This is great news for Talladega College and the Marching Tornadoes. This will open up the door for the band and College to make a remarkable rise. ” Talladega College, which was founded by descendants of slaves in 1867, is set to make the   trip to the nation’s capital for the January 20 event. Talladega’s acceptance is also noteworthy considering  . C.  Howard University, another historically black college, declined to sign up to participate in the inaugural parade. Howard’s band director, John Newson, cited budgetary concerns among the reasons the band declined to perform. Trump’s inauguration has been a lighting rod in recent weeks with threats of boycott being leveled against   opera singer Andrea Bocelli and a petition calling for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to back out of the inauguration gathering several thousand signatures.

23192,Viacom Board Said to End Salary for Sumner Redstone - The New York Times,"The ailing media mogul Sumner M. Redstone will no longer draw a salary from Viacom, one of the big media companies he controls, two people briefed on the development said Wednesday. The move follows a   legal battle in California that highlighted Mr. Redstone’s failing health while challenging his mental capacity. The case was dismissed last week, but the details that emerged prompted Viacom’s board to evaluate his compensation and status. Eliminating his pay is a gesture toward acknowledging that he is no longer involved in operations and deserving pay as a company executive. Mr. Redstone, 92, remains chairman emeritus and controlling shareholder of Viacom and CBS, a $40 billion media empire. He controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in the companies through National Amusements, the private theater chain company started by his father. Control of the two companies will be passed to a trust only after he dies or is declared not competent. Filed in November by a former companion and romantic partner, the lawsuit included embarrassing and salacious claims about Mr. Redstone, who has had minor strokes and has a speech impediment. Those included details about his sexual appetite, incontinence and demands to eat steak while on a feeding tube. Those details prompted investors to raise questions about Mr. Redstone’s pay, his role at his companies and other corporate governance issues. In February, he stepped down as chairman at both companies. In dismissing the case after only one day, the judge relied heavily on videotaped testimony from Mr. Redstone, saying the media mogul had convincingly asserted that he did not want the former companion, Manuela Herzer, to supervise his health care, as she was seeking. “I think he said what he wanted to say,” the judge said. But the same testimony, a transcript of which was released to news organizations, also included halting answers, profanity, forgetfulness and nonresponsiveness  —   putting renewed focus on the media mogul’s mental capacity. There was also an evaluation by a geriatric psychiatrist. The judge, in his evaluation of the testimony, said, “It is also not in dispute that Redstone suffers from either mild or moderate dementia. ” Mr. Redstone’s total compensation was $2 million in the 2015 fiscal year, down from $13 million in 2014. Viacom’s board met on Wednesday. It is not clear whether the board of CBS was making the same considerations. CBS declined to comment. The Viacom development was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",0

23200,"Trump’s Reservations Still Loom Over Pending AT&ampT, Time Warner Merger - Breitbart","The pathway forward for ATT’s pending $85 billion merger with Time Warner goes through President Donald Trump’s apprehensions about the deal, concerns that don’t appear to be going away any time soon. [The real estate magnate chided the deal on the campaign trail, saying, “It’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. ”  Critics argue that the increased concentration of media and telecom companies hurts competition and consumers. Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, also opposes the deal. Trump’s apprehensions with the merger stem partly from CNN, a subsidiary of Time Warner, which he argues covers him unfairly. Trump has called the network a “fake news” network as the outlet’s personalities have repeatedly criticized him as he’s taken the highest office in the land. Fox Business’ Charlie Gasparino claims that Time Warner might need to spin off CNN as a separate entity to make the deal work. But it’s not just CNN’s biased coverage against him that has led to President Trump’s opposition to the merger. During the campaign, his economic adviser Peter Navarro —  now the director of the newly created National Trade Council in the Trump White House —  said Trump is generally opposed to the consolidation of media power in a handful of companies: The very corporations that have gained from shipping America’s factories and jobs offshore are the very same media conglomerates now pushing Hillary Clinton’s agenda. She is the official candidate of the multinational ruling elite. NBC, and its Clinton megaphone MSNBC, were once owned by General Electric, a leader in offshoring factories to China. Now NBC has been bought by Comcast, which is specifically targeting the Chinese market  —   even as Comcast’s anchors and reporters at MSNBC engage in their Never Trump tactics. ATT, the original and abusive “Ma Bell” telephone monopoly, is now trying to buy Time Warner and thus the wildly   CNN. Donald Trump would never approve such a deal because it concentrates too much power in the hands of the too and powerful few. Senator Jeff Sessions ( ) once confirmed as attorney general, would the merger. When asked by Senator Mike Lee ( ) about whether there would be side deals requiring CNN to be spun off for the merger to be approved, Sessions said, “The law is not crystal clear about what’s lawful and what’s not lawful and what the antitrust division is required to do and it leave dangers, if not politicization of it, it remains dangers of policy agendas getting embroiled in it. ” The law’s ambiguity allows for flexibility when it comes to Trump’s decision on the merger because he has not made up his mind yet on the matter. President Trump says that he has “not seen all the facts. ” He told Axios, “I have been on the record in the past of saying it’s too big and we have to keep competition.

Dianne Feinstein ( ) called the NRA an “extreme organization” that stands in the way of getting “  assault weapons off our streets. ”[Feinstein’s NRA comment came after she voiced her expectations that the Supreme Court will have final say on air and water pollution and just before she addressed employers who “[discriminate] against workers. ”  CSPAN 2 aired Feinstein’s comments: “It is the Supreme Court that will have final word   …     [on] whether the NRA and other extreme organizations will be able to block common sense gun regulations, including those that keep   assault weapons off our streets. ” Many things are at play in Feinstein’s statement, including the ongoing Democrat animosity toward the fact that the Supreme Court rulings in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010) pose a great hindrance to the future of gun control in this country. Moreover, Feinstein’s statement betrays her continued support of an “assault weapons” ban, such as the one that Democrats enacted during the Clinton administration or the one Feinstein herself unsuccessfully pushed after the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. On September 14, 2014, Breitbart News reported a New York Times (NYT) column that described “assault weapons” as a “myth” Democrats created in the 1990s. NYT pointed out, “In the early 1990s   …     Democrats created and then banned a category of guns they called ‘assault weapons.’ America was then suffering from a spike in gun crime and it seemed like a problem threatening everyone. Gun murders each year had been climbing: 11, 000, then 13, 000, then 17, 000. ” It then showed that the creation of the “assault weapons” moniker was a political contrivance: “This   category of guns —  a selection of rifles, shotguns, and handguns with ‘military features’ —  only figured in about 2 percent of gun crime before the ban. Handguns were used in more than 80 percent of gun murders each year. ” In the 1990s, the Democrats created a category of guns called “assault weapons,” demonized them, then set out to ban them as a way to keep Americans safe. However, the whole time, such weapons were only used in “about 2 percent of gun crime. ” The truth then and now is that concealable weapons are far preferable for criminals than bulky,    weapons of any type. Moreover, FBI crime stats for 2015 show nearly three times more people were stabbed or hacked to death than were killed with rifles and shotguns combined, and those are rifles and shotguns of any type. If we were to specify a certain type of rifle —  an   or   —  the ratio of stabbing deaths versus shooting deaths would be even more lopsided.

23203,Professor Who Tweeted Against PC Culture Is Out at NYU,"Professor Who Tweeted Against PC Culture Is Out at NYU Melkorka Licea, New York Post, October 30, 2016 
An NYU professor crusading against political correctness and student coddling was booted from the classroom last week after his colleagues complained about his “incivility,” The Post has learned. 
Liberal studies prof Michael Rectenwald, 57, said he was forced Wednesday to go on paid leave for the rest of the semester. 
{snip} 
Rectenwald launched an undercover Twitter account called Deplorable NYU Prof on Sept. 12 to argue against campus trends like “safe spaces,” “trigger warnings” policing Halloween costumes and other aspects of academia’s growing PC culture. 
He chose to be anonymous, he explained in one of his first tweets, because he was afraid “the PC Gestapo would ruin me” if he put his name ­behind his conservative ideas on the famously liberal campus. 
{snip} 
But the Twitter feed soon sparked a “witch hunt” by the growing army of “social justice warriors,” he said. 
In an interview published Monday in the Washington Square News, NYU’s Independent Student Newspaper, the eight-year instructor admitted he was the Deplorable NYU Prof. 
“My contention is that trigger warning, safe spaces and bias hot-line reporting is not politically correct. It is insane,” he told the student paper. “The crazier and crazier that this left gets . . . the more the alt-right is going to be laughing their asses off [and] getting more pissed.”, he was quoted as saying. 
{snip} 
But Rectenwald says he began getting “dirty looks” in his department and on Wednesday figured out why: A 12-person committee calling itself the Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group, including two deans, published a letter to the editor in the same paper. 
“As long as he airs his views with so little appeal to evidence and civility, we must find him guilty of illogic and incivility in a community that predicates its work in great part on rational thought and the civil exchange of ideas,” they wrote of the untenured assistant professor. 
“We seek to create a dynamic community that values full participation. Such efforts are not the ‘destruction of academic integrity’ Professor Rectenwald suggests, but rather what make possible our program’s approach to global studies,” they argued. Rectenwald likened the attack to “a Salem witch trial. They took my views personally. I never even mentioned them and I never even said NYU liberal studies program. I was talking about academia at large,” said the professor, a popular instructor who was graded 4.4 out of 5 on ratemyprofessors.com . 
The same day the letter was published, Rectenwald was summoned to a meeting with his department dean and an HR representative, he says. 
“They claimed they were worried about me and a couple people had expressed concern about my mental health. They suggested my voicing these opinions was a cry for help,” Rectenwald told The Post. “Then they said I should leave and get help.” 
{snip} 
Students told him that professors openly discussed with students how he may be fired. 
The leave has “absolutely zero to do with his Twitter account or his opinions on issues of the day,” said NYU spokesman Matt Nagel. 
But Rectenwald is disheartened. 
“I’m afraid my academic career is over,” he said Rectenwald. “Academic freedom: It’s great, as long as you don’t use it.”",0

23208,Islamic State Urges ’All Out War’ on West for Ramadan,"The Islamic State ( ) in its annual call for violence during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, has urged jihadists and sympathizers to wage an “  war” in the West, stressing the targeting of noncombatants. [Through encrypted Telegram messaging app channels and YouTube, ISIS has disseminated its Ramadan propaganda in the form of an   slideshow.  The group’s 2017 Ramadan call for violence is titled “Where Are the Lions of War?” Specifically, the message urges jihadists to carry out attacks in the United States, Russia, and across Europe. “Your targeting of the   innocents and civilians is beloved by us and the most effective, so go forth and may you get a great reward or martyrdom in Ramadan,” declares ISIS in the message. “Attack them in their homes, their markets, their roads and their forums,” the group adds. ISIS urges suicide bombers to carry out attacks now. The message states: O ye righteous believers in America, Russia and Europe. O supporters of the caliphate, o you who can’t reach the Islamic state lands and you are now among the idolaters, roll up clothes of your grandfather arm and believe in your quest, and know that our war with our enemy is   war and an of easy conciliation easy to reach so make them busy with themselves away from muslims and Islamic state lands and remember the words of your Prophet peace be upon him: (the disbeliever and his killer never meet in hell). While most Muslims follow the tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset during the month of Ramadan, others adhere to the belief that perceives Ramadan as a month of jihad and martyrdom. Islamist and jihadi organizations, such as ISIS, encourage their followers to carry out violent attacks during the holiest month for Muslims, which begins Friday night. There is usually a spike in terrorist attacks during Ramadan. Last year alone, Islamic   terrorists killed at least 420 people and wounded nearly 730 others across the world during the holy month, described last year as one of the bloodiest in modern history. “Prepare yourselves and be ready, and make sure that you spend all the time in the invading for the say of Allah, and ask God what you request, to make it a month and a curse on the infidels everywhere,” states the ISIS 2017 Ramadan message. The terrorist group encourages jihadists to carry out attacks in their home countries as nations across the world have tightened up security, making it difficult for jihadists to travel to ISIS’s   Caliphate. Addressing “soldiers of the caliphate and its supporters in Europe and America,” ISIS advises, “If the tyrants have closed the door of emigration open in their faces the door of Jihad  …     the smallest work you do in their homes is better and more beloved to us than our greatest work,” reports The Foreign Desk.",0
23209,"Trump ERUPTS At Secret Meeting With The Press, Transition In Chaos (TWEETS) | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave","on November 21, 2016 7:58 pm · 
Donald Trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and he’s only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the President-elect. 
On Monday, Trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. 
Some reporters in attendance were NBC’s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC’s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS’ Norah O’Donnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News’ Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC’s Phil Griffin; and CNN’s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. 
Unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it , “It was like a f*cking firing squad.” 
Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post , one anonymous source said: 
“The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.” 
This claim was backed up by another person, who said: 
“The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. 
“Trump kept saying, ‘We’re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars.” 
This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. 
Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
Interestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: 
“Excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.” 
Disgraceful.

23211,Sen. Ted Cruz to ’Storm Congress’ Rally: It Is Time to Repeal Obamacare ’We Are Out of Excuses’,"Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz revved up hundreds of Tea Party activists at Wednesday’s “Storm Congress” rally against the American Health Care Act crafted by Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .) to stabilize health insurance markets, rather than repeal the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. [“Thank you for braving the cold and thank you for standing up and fighting for freedom,” said Cruz, who was on a roster of speakers that included Sen. Rand Paul (R. .) Jenny Beth Martin  —   the leader of the Tea Party Patriots  —   and members of the House Freedom Caucus. The rally was organized by FreedomWorks, the   policy and logistics hub for Tea Party and conservative activists. The master of ceremonies was Andrew Wilkow, the host of the XMSirius radio show The Wilkow Majority.     “In November Democrats were shocked, the media was shocked —  although I repeat myself, and millions of   Americans across this country rose up and said: ‘Enough is enough and we have a mandate for change. ’” Cruz said Republicans promised for more than six years that if the voters gave them control of the House, Senate, and White House, the GOP would repeal Obamacare. Now, the GOP controls Congress and the White House, he said. “Well, you know what? We’re out of excuses. The time for talk is over. Now, is the time for action. ” After the rally, FreedomWorks staffers escorted teams of activists to meetings with congressmen and senators, where they advocated for a clean repeal of Obamacare, instead of the bill Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .) crafted  —   the American Health Care Act, or RyanCare. The RyanCare bill does not repeal and replace the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Rather it keeps its structure and programs in place. Central to the bill is the support it provides to the insurance companies by preserving the Individual Mandate as a program administered by the insurance companies and the cutbacks to Medicaid. The expansion of Medicaid pulled millions of lower income insurance customers out of the private market, which drastically changed business conditions for the insurance companies. Now that the American Health Care Act passed the House Budget Committee, the bill is in front of the House Rules Committee, which is tasked with providing the conditions for the bill’s debate on the House floor. As RyanCare moved through the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget committees, it remained unchanged from the exact text the speaker’s office posted March 6 at 6 p. m. Whether or not the Rules committee allows amendments on the House floor will signal if the speaker has the votes to muscle through his text unaltered.",0
23212,Mormon Tabernacle Choir Singer Quits over Trump Inauguration,"A member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir has quit the esteemed singing company over its scheduled performance at   Donald Trump’s inauguration in Washington DC in January. [In a resignation letter sent to fellow choir members and later posted on Facebook, singer Jan Chamberlin said she’d spent “several sleepless nights and days in turmoil and agony” since the choir announced it would perform at the inauguration, and that she could not “in good conscience” join her colleagues at the event.  “I have highly valued the mission of the Choir to be   will ambassadors for Christ, to share beautiful music and to give hope, inspiration, and comfort to others,” Chamberlin wrote. “I’ve tried to tell myself that it will be alright and that I can continue in good conscience before God and man. ” “But it’s no use,” she added. “I simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events. I could never look myself in the mirror again with self respect. ” The Mormon Tabernacle Choir  —   dubbed “America’s Choir” by President Ronald Reagan at his inauguration in 1981  —   has performed at the inaugurations of numerous presidents throughout history, including those for Lyndon B. Johnson, Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush. But since the announcement that it would perform at Trump’s inauguration, the choir has been the subject of a petition seeking to persuade the group to cancel its performance that has since gathered thousands of signatures. “As members and friends of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, we strongly urge the Church to stop this practice and especially for an incoming president who has demonstrated sexist, racist, misogynistic, and xenophobic behavior that does not align with the principles and teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints,” the petition, which has garnered more than 23, 000 signatures, states. In her resignation letter, Chamberlin wrote that by preforming for Trump’s inauguration, it would appear to those outside the choir that the group is “endorsing tyranny and fascism. ” “And Choir’s wonderful image and networking will be severely damaged and that many good people throughout this land and throughout the world already do and will continue to feel betrayed,” she wrote. “I believe hereafter our message will not be believed by many that have loved us and adored what we have stood for. ” The Mormon Tabernacle Choir will join the Radio City Rockettes at the inauguration, while teenage opera singer Jackie Evancho is slated to perform the National Anthem.

23217,"The Left Turns on Bob Dylan for His Pro-Israel Views, Refusal to Acknowledge Nobel Prize","The Left Turns on Bob Dylan for His Pro-Israel Views, Refusal to Acknowledge Nobel Prize Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
So Bob Dylan has won the Nobel Prize for Literature “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” His name is now enshrined among a list of laureates that includes luminaries like T. S. Eliot, William Faulkner, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. 
It’s a tremendous honor for the legendary singer-songwriter, that’s for sure. But it’s also stirred up its share of controversy. I won’t debate Dylan’s award—I’ll leave that to my esteemed colleagues Andrew Klavan and Ron Radosh —except to say two quick things. First, when the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to people like Yasser Arafat and Barack Obama, did it dim the luster of the prizes in other categories? And second, I like the idea of songs like “Gotta Serve Somebody” and “Saved” (and, apologies to Andrew, even “It Ain’t Me, Babe”) joining the pantheon of Nobel Prize-winning literature. 
But now that the reliably left-leaning Nobel Prize Committee has given Dylan an award, a funny thing has happened. The left has begun to turn on Dylan for being less than the predictable leftist they have expected him to be. In Defense of Bob Dylan’s Nobel Prize for Literature—He Deserves it! 
The first example comes to us from that cherished source of unbiased news, Al Jazeera. In a recent editorial , French sociologist and “media critic” Ali Saad takes the media to task for reporting the news of Bob Dylan’s award without mentioning that he— gasp— supports Israel. Saad gripes that: 
…media outlets, both Arab and international, framed the story without taking issue with Dylan’s pro-Israel stance and instead portrayed him exclusively through the prism of his constructed image as defender of the oppressed. 
Saad goes on to cite “Neighborhood Bully,” an early ’80s tune from Dylan that expresses support for the nation of Israel. 
The song, that Stephen Holden described in The New York Times in 1983 as “ an outspoken defence of Israel “, begins by stating two key precepts emphasising the Israeli perspective: first by comparing Israel to a man in exile whose enemies unjustly “claim he’s on their land”, a sentence that serves as a scolding to those who refute the legitimacy of Israel’s historic claim to Palestine’s land. Then, by metaphorically presenting Israel as a man “outnumbered by a million to one”, which postulates the frequent representation of Israel as the underdog of the Middle East.Such a stance by an anti-war activist raises serious doubts over Dylan’s commitment to humanity

23218,"Martin Schulz, President of European Parliament, Will Return to German Politics - The New York Times","BRUSSELS  —   Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament since 2012, announced on Thursday his return to German politics, fueling speculation that he might challenge Chancellor Angela Merkel, who plans to seek a fourth term in elections next year. The announcement by Mr. Schulz, 60, had been expected. Speculation about his return to German politics gained new momentum after   Steinmeier, Germany’s foreign minister, was tapped to become the country’s next president. Mr. Schulz said he would seek a seat in the federal Parliament from North   the most populous state in Germany. From there, he might lead the Social Democratic Party’s challenge to Ms. Merkel’s party, the   Christian Democratic Union, in elections scheduled for September. The two parties have governed Germany in a “grand coalition” since 2013. Another possible scenario is that Mr. Schulz would replace Mr. Steinmeier as foreign minister, a possibility if the Social Democrats were to select their chairman, Sigmar Gabriel, currently the vice chancellor, as the party’s candidate for chancellor, the head of government. A former bookshop owner and mayor of Würselen, a town in North   Mr. Schulz was elected to the European Parliament in 1994. He rose to prominence in 2003 when Italy’s prime minister at the time, Silvio Berlusconi, called him a “capo,” or a Nazi concentration camp commander, during a debate at the European Parliament. Mr. Berlusconi made the insult after Mr. Schulz questioned him about conflicts of interest in his business affairs. Mr. Schulz was warmly applauded by other lawmakers after describing Mr. Berlusconi, a tycoon, as unfit to represent Europe. On Thursday, Mr. Schulz was circumspect about his plans and declined to take any questions from reporters. His decision also left open the question of who will succeed him as the president of the European Parliament. The two biggest political groups in the Parliament, Mr. Schulz’s Social Democrats and the   European People’s Party, have long had an informal arrangement in which they take turns at the presidency. Unusually, a socialist, Mr. Schulz, has held the job for the last two terms, and he was originally thought to be interested in a third. Mr. Schulz’s departure makes it more likely that a member of the   would get the job. But that would put a member of the   in charge of the top three European Union jobs.

Only by doing this will it be possible to regain the lost trust,” Mr. Schulz said, in an apparent reference to the populist parties that have roiled politics across the Western world, including parts of Germany. “Germany in particular as the biggest member state of the European Union bears a special responsibility which until now I have tried to fulfill as a German member of the European Parliament and in the future I will strive to fulfill from Berlin,” he said.",0
23231,Al Gore Says God Told Him to Fight Global Warming,"Former Vice President Al Gore is now telling his climate disciples that God commands us to go forth and fight global warming. [Engaging in some advanced publicity for his new global warming film spectacular, “An Inconvenient Sequel,” Gore told Interview Magazine that God didn’t create global warming and wants us to fix it.  In his comments, Gore equated the fight against global warming to a   moral crusade similar to the civil rights fight, women’s suffrage, and the abolitionist movement during the Civil War era. Gore insisted that it is a moral imperative to fight against climate change. “Regarding the climate movement,” Gore said warming to his point, “there are people who say, ‘God is in complete control of everything that happens, and if the Earth is getting warmer, then maybe God intends that. ’” Gore then rejected that conceit. “Well, no,” the     former veep insisted. “God intends for us to take responsibility for how we treat God’s creation, and if we choose to use the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet as an open sewer for   tons of   pollution every day, the consequences are attributable to us. ” He concluded saying, “And if you are a believer, as I am, I think God intends for us to open our eyes and take responsibility for the moral consequences of our actions. ” Gore’s new film is a sequel to his famed “An Inconvenient Truth,” a shockumentary filled with mistaken assertions and failed predictions. Despite the many inaccuracies of his previous film, in an interview last year Gore still insisted that he “underestimated” how bad global warming is. “I wish the film had   the seriousness of the crisis, but unfortunately it actually underestimated how serious it is,” the   Tennessee Senator said.

23232,Some Cities Want Their Noncitizen Immigrants to Vote,"Some Cities Want Their Noncitizen Immigrants to Vote Caroline Winter, Bloomberg Businessweek, October 28, 2016 
“Look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,” Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There’s no evidence to support the Republican nominee’s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. 
The latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city’s public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. “One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn’t have a voice,” says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. “We’ve had legal immigrants who’ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.” Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the “broken immigration system in this country.” 
{snip} 
Today there are six jurisdictions in Maryland that let noncitizens vote in local elections. Chicago allows them to take part in elected parent advisory councils but not to vote in school board elections. Four towns in Massachusetts have moved to allow noncitizen voting and are awaiting state approval. And in New York City, where noncitizens make up 21 percent of the voting-age population, the city council is drafting legislation that would allow more than 1.3 million legal residents to take part in municipal elections. The city previously allowed noncitizens to vote in school board elections, but that ended when New York’s school boards were dissolved in 2002.

23233,Val Kilmer Credits Christian Science Faith for Helping to Cure His Cancer,"Val Kilmer credits love and his Christian Science faith for helping him successfully beat cancer. [Page Six pointed out that in a Reddit AMA on Tuesday, one user asked the actor and devout Christian Scientist: “What would you want fans to know about having, and beating, the Big C. ?”  “I am very grateful for all the prayers and good thoughts from around the world,” the    Heat star replied. “People that know I am a Christian Scientist make the assumption that I have somehow endangered myself. But many many people have been healed by prayer throughout recorded history. And many many people have died by whatever was modern medicine. ” Kilmer said that multiple doctors prayed for him while he was in the hospital and he even spoke to the inventor of the defibrillator, Dr. Bernard Lowen. Kilmer recounted his conversation with Lowen, saying, “He started to weep without his voice wavering and he leaned into me and said, ‘Fluff their pillow. That what I tell all the interns. LOVE. Love heals. More than any other skills, I urge them to LOVE the life they are entrusted to save.’ Well that’s what is at the heart of Mrs. Eddy’s understanding of the teachings of Jesus. ” Kilmer revealed his battle with cancer in a previous Reddit AMA when one user asked him about actor Michael Douglas’ claim that he was battling a terminal form of the illness. “He was probably trying to help me cause press probably asked where I was these days, and I did have a healing of cancer, but my tongue is still swollen altho healing all the time,” Kilmer replied then. “Because I don’t sound my normal self yet people think I may still be under the weather. ”   Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

23234,Chinese Cardinal Worried that Vatican Will ‘Sell Out’ Underground Church,"China’s highest ranking prelate, Cardinal Joseph Zen, is urging Pope Francis not to cut a deal with the Chinese government that would undermine the sacrifice and fidelity of members of the underground Catholic Church in the country. [“We are very much worried because it seems that the Vatican is going to make a very bad agreement with China,” Cardinal Zen told LifeSiteNews in an interview published Tuesday.  Zen said that Pope Francis “is really naïve” and “doesn’t know the Chinese communists. ” Moreover, “the people around him are not good at all. They have very wrong ideas. And I’m afraid that they may sell out our underground Church,” Zen added. In past months, the Vatican has been engaged in talks with leaders of China’s Communist Party in an effort to establish diplomatic ties with the country. Critics suggest that if the deal happens, the Vatican would likely have to give up its existing ties with the government in Taiwan, which currently only has official ties with a few small, mostly poor countries. The deal being discussed would reportedly hand over a certain amount of   power to the Chinese government regarding the naming of new bishops. The government would propose candidates and the Pope would choose from among the clergy vetted by the communists. Priests and bishops in the underground church have faced imprisonment for their fidelity to the Holy See, rather than submitting to the “patriotic” church under the control of the Communist government. Zen, the Bishop Emeritus of Hong Kong, said that China’s communist rulers want “total surrender” from the Church. In an apparent move to placate Chinese leadership, Pope Francis recently defended the practice of religious liberty in the officially atheist country, insisting that in China churches are full and religion is freely practiced. In a lengthy interview with the Spanish daily El País, the Pope said he would love to visit China “as soon as they invite me,” something he says he has made clear to Chinese authorities. Francis said that the Vatican is engaged in ongoing dialogue with China and that a commission has been set up that meets every three months, with Beijing and the Vatican alternating as hosts of the encounter. “China always has this aura of mystery about it that is fascinating,” Francis said, noting that not long ago the Vatican Museums held an exhibition in Beijing and that China would be reciprocating with an exhibit to be housed at the Vatican. “In China the churches are full,” Francis insisted. “You can practice your faith in China. ” Cardinal Zen has said that diplomatic relations with China are not worth selling out the underground Church which has suffered for decades because of its fidelity to Rome. In Zen’s mind, the proposed deal would betray what the Church holds most dear. “You cannot go into negotiations with the mentality ‘we want to sign an agreement at any cost’ then you are surrendering yourself, you are betraying yourself, you are betraying Jesus Christ,” Zen said. The Cardinal also said that a Vatican deal with the Chinese government would undermine the Church’s credibility and set a bad precedent for dealing with other countries as well. According to Zen, some officials of the Holy See consider the underground faithful to be “troublemakers. ” Although he has met with the Pope to explain the situation faced by Catholics in China, Zen isn’t confident that Francis will come to their aid. I’ve written many letters to the Pope, Zen said, but then “he doesn’t answer my letters. ” “The thing we can do is to pray,” said Zen. “We believe in the power of prayer. ” Follow Thomas D.

From The Daily Caller : 
Reporter 
6:10 PM 11/06/2016 
California isn’t even close to a swing state in the 2016 presidential election, but that doesn’t mean nothing is at stake for voters in the nation’s largest state. 
After Tuesday’s vote, hundreds of thousands of California schoolchildren may start attending classes primarily en español, thanks to a voter referendum that would repeal the requirement that schools teach primarily in English. 
California’s Proposition 58 would repeal Proposition 227, a measure that easily passed nearly two decades ago, in 1998. Proposition 227 required all public schools in the state teach “overwhelmingly” in English, with limited-English proficiency (LEP) students transitioning to fully English classes as quickly as possible. 
When passed, Proposition 227 overthrew the previous norm of bilingual education. … 
But now, with California’s immigrant population higher than ever, the state is poised to reverse course. 
Polls indicate the Proposition 58 is likely to pass. Ironically, supporters of the measure place an emphasis on English rather than foreign tongues. They argue that the bill will allow for “dual immersion” programs, where both native English and native Spanish speakers can learn in a bilingual environment. In the long run, they argue, this will increase multilingualism and provide the state with a competitive advantage. 
Dual immersion is legal already, it just requires parents’ consent. What these disputes are about is which is the default: English or Spanish? 
Supporters also claim that returning to bilingual education will improve students’ English acquisition; favorable ads emphasize that Proposition 58 will ensure that “all students learn English.” 
But the primary thrust of the proposition is clear: Students from non-English homes will find it far easier to have their children be primarily taught in their native tongue, while spending far less time learning English.",0

23248,Government Confirm Compensation For Survivors Of Symphysiotomy Got ‘Lost In The Post’,"0 Add Comment 
THE GOVERNMENT has put a number of survivors of symphysiotomy minds at ease with their latest explanation for why the State have failed to operate and administer a compensation scheme in a time effective and compassionate manner, WWN can reveal. 
“Ah, ye can’t trust that Eircode, it’s a load of shite,” confirmed a government spokesman, failing to be drawn on the fact the scheme was set up in such a way as to avoid bringing anyone to account for administering the non-consensual and often unnecessary surgeries to over 1,500 women. 
“But listen, get onto An Post there and complain, we swear we sent it. This isn’t like all the other times we were just delaying giving women, many of whom are now in their 80s, their compensation for having their pelvises broken against their wishes by a medical professional working for the State,” the spokesman added, full of compassion. 
Survivors have been relentlessly campaigning since the compensation scheme was first put in place, simply to access the money rightfully owed to them. 
Keen to remain in the public consciousness in order to force successive governments to honour their commitment and admonish them for so openly working against victims, many of the women have died in recent years without receiving any of the money they are entitled to after those administering the compensation scheme have demanded an unrealistic amount of paperwork. 
It is thought Ireland’s main opposition party Fianna Fáil would be in an ideal position to make an issue of the scandalous roadblocks and delays put in front of the women, however, the party’s leader Micheál Martin stood over a number of delays when he was minister for health along with his successors in the position Mary Harney, James Reilly and Leo Varadkar. 
“Honestly, this is a terrible misunderstanding, we’re not trying to limit the State’s liability and just drag this out until all the women have passed away, relying on the public’s apathy to let us go unchallenged, that’s not our style. Argh, it’s that blasted Eircode, we’re telling you,” the spokesman added.

23251,Tennessee Prison Hosts Program to Help Inmates Become Better Fathers,"A Tennessee prison program designed to help inmates become better fathers graduated nearly 40 inmates Friday. [The selected inmates graduated from the Malachi Dads program at the Morgan County Correctional Complex, which teaches inmates   skills and fosters personal growth so inmates can become better fathers, WBIR reported.  “I picked the streets before my family, and this program has shown me that God is first, then my family second,” inmate Darryl Wiseman said. For the past year, Wiseman has been taking classes facilitated by volunteer mentors of the program. The program culminates Saturday with the Returning Hearts Celebration, where the fathers reunite with their families in the prison yard and participate in   activities with them. “I think I’m going to cry real hard first,” Wiseman said ahead of Saturday’s celebration. “I’m going to be nervous to see them because I want them to see a new side of me. They’re going to be able to see that I have that glow, that I have that light and that I’m walking for him now, for Jesus. They’re going to see the gentler side of me. ” Wiseman, who has served three years out of a   sentence, says he found purpose in life as a result of these classes. “It changed my life, it really did. If changed me on how to be a man and a father to my children,” he said. Robert Reburn, a public information officer for the Tennessee Department of Corrections, said there is no statistical data to measure the impact of the program but stated that corrections officers have noticed inmates’ behavior change because of programs like Malachi Dads. “We can say for a fact that offenders who are still in our custody and enrolled in these programs are less argumentative, they get less discipline, they cause fewer problems and they are overall much more well behaved than those who are not participating,” Reburn said. Other states have similar programs implemented in their prisons, mostly organized by   ministries. These programs have been   in Michigan, Colorado, and Wisconsin.",0

23257,Nigel Farage on Article 50: ’Well Done Bannon Well Done Breitbart – You’ve Helped with This Hugely’ - Breitbart,"As the Prime Minister’s Article 50 letter made its way to Brussels, Brexit campaign leader Nigel Farage paid “a personal tribute and thank you” to former Breitbart boss Stephen K. Bannon for the role he played in securing victory for the Leave campaign in the European Union (EU) referendum. [In an interview with Breitbart London Editor in Chief Raheem Kassam on Breitbart News Daily, to mark the occasion of Britain finally triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and officially commencing the Brexit process, the former UKIP chief was bursting with enthusiasm:  “Good morning everybody! It’s a happy day here in London!” he began. “All through the campaign, I went round the country with a placard that said, ‘We want out country back’  —   and I’m just getting a marker pen, and I’m going to cross out the ‘want’ and put ‘got’. “It’s a big, big day, and I think at 12:30, when that letter is delivered in Brussels we will have passed the point of no return. We are going to become an independent,   normal democratic nation again. ” Kassam asked the veteran campaigner if he had ever worried that “legacy Remainers” such as former prime minister Tony Blair and millionaire financier Gina Miller, might succeed in preventing this day from coming to pass. “Well, it shouldn’t have taken nine months,” Farage replied. “Talk about a long gestation!” He did not believe, however, that there was any realistic way out for the political class after more than 17 million British voters backed Brexit, and suggested the delay may have been due to the fact that “the establishment did not want us to vote to leave [and] did not expect us to vote to leave” and made no contingency plans for it. Asked if he thought diehard Remainers might now turn their efforts towards making a success of Brexit, Farage was sceptical. “I don’t think they’ll ever give up they’ve been so used to having their own way,” he said. “But they will begin to look more and more ridiculous. ” Farage confessed that family, friends, and colleagues “all thought I’d been smoking something funny” when he first set out in politics, and that actually achieving Brexit “looked completely and utterly impossible in every way”. “But it’s been a   journey. At first, dozens of people were there helping and supporting me. Then it was hundreds, then it was thousands, then it was millions  —   and today, the impossible dream came true. ” Farage attributed Brexit to failures within the EU itself, including the euro “which nearly all the Remoaners would have signed the country up to 15 years ago”. He took the opportunity to pay tribute to Breitbart News Network in general and former Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, now a leading figure within President Donald J. Trump’s administration, in particular, for giving eurosceptic voices shut out by the establishment media a platform where they could speak to the public: “One of the very important things that happened is, because we had the entire media against us, and not even willing to give us a fair hearing, I think when Bannon opened up the Breitbart office in London and began to give the arguments that I was making a fair hearing, and very quickly, as Breitbart does well, started to reach a very, very big audience. I think actually on this great Brexit day I have to say a personal thank you and tribute to Steve Bannon for having the foresightedness of doing that with Breitbart, and I’m extremely grateful. ” ",0

23269,A SNOBOL's Chance,"snoofle Over thirty years of professional experience designing and developing high performance parallel transactional server side systems in ""C"", ""C++"" and Java on *nix and Windows platforms for military, financial and health platforms. Bachelor's in Geological Engineering and Masters in Computer Science. 
We’ve all inherited legacy systems. You know the sort; 20 years old, more than 50,000 lines of code, poorly designed - even for its time, completely undocumented externally and useless code comments within, mangled beyond recognition due to countless developers making myriad ad-hoc changes upon changes and so-on. Now imagine such a system written in a tool that’s been around for nearly half a century, but rarely used for the intended purpose of the application. 
Reg worked for a firm that built space-rocket related applications; specifically an Ada compiler, written in SNOBOL , for a 15+ years obsolete legacy processor used in the rocket. The system itself consisted of more than 100 SPITBOL (a speedier compiler of SNOBOL) programs, most of which were written by one guy nearly four decades ago, Barry. Barry was a former sixties hippie-turned-coder. Though long since retired, he had been called back to active duty to try and help decipher what this thing does. 
The code is full of comments explaining what each block does, but not why . Nor were the comments up to date with what the code actually did, which was one set of “bugs”, in addition to the more normal set of errors. Of course, in those days, nobody wrote unit tests (was it even possible to write test suites for SNOBOL?) Some of the more interesting phenomena included mangled memory addresses, incorrect hex/decimal conversions, offsets disappearing, seemingly random mangling/unmangling/remangling of variable names, etc. 
Reg’s ongoing project was to replace this mess with a shiny new Ada compiler written in Python. 
Along the way, Reg had to deal with all the control flow of SNOBOL (e.g.: goto’s), on-the-fly execution of strings containing arbitrary SNOBOL code, the immediate-value-assignment operators (‘.’ and ‘$’) and pattern matching that would reduce a regex-wizard to a quivering mass of Jello. 
Even Barry, the tie-dyed, retired, hippie could no longer decipher what the internals were doing. Maybe he’d just fried too many neurons. Reg couldn’t get any further- maybe he just wasn’t smoking enough marijuana to understand what the hippie had done. Reg decided to simply try to replicate the output of the legacy system. This was accomplished by running both systems on the same input and doing diffs. 
This project started long before Reg joined the firm, and will probably be going strong long after he’s gone. 
Reg got the number of diffs on the output down to less than 1,000. That might not sound great, but almost all of them were caused by bugs in the legacy code. 
Now his toughest job begins: explaining to management why success must be defined as about 1,000 differences in the output between the legacy and replacement systems, and, more importantly, determining whether correcting the output of the previous systems will cause the rocket to act in an undesirable manner.

23271,Demand for Nintendo Switch Leads to Nintendo and Apple Battling for Scarce Parts - Breitbart,"Having trouble getting your hands on Nintendo’s newest hit console? The problem may be in your pocket. [Nintendo hopes to sell another 10 million Nintendo Switch consoles in the next fiscal year, but they are trying to produce nearly double that number in order to meet demand. Yet despite their ambition, production efforts are being hamstrung. The culprit? None other than Apple, who needs many of the same parts to produces their internationally popular products.  NAND   chips, LCD screens, and vibration motors top the list of   commodities to the industry at large. The sudden addition of a   new console employing many of the same technologies has caused a significant shortage in parts, and manufacturers simply have not been able to keep up with demand. A spokeswoman for Toshiba stated that “Demand for our NAND flash memory has been overwhelmingly greater than supply, and the situation is likely to stay for the rest of this year. ” That is bad news for Nintendo, because the video game giant simply cannot compete with hardware as widespread and established as the iPhone. One is a very hot new piece of entertainment, but the other has become so deeply ingrained in our daily lives that it can cause its own version of separation anxiety. If Nintendo can’t   Apple, their only alternative is to  . But paying more would stress Nintendo’s bottom line, and could potentially push the Switch beyond the sleek $299 price point that is proving so popular. Furthermore, the production of additional units isn’t always translating into additional households. The Switch’s portable nature  —   but complete lack of transferable save data  —   has prompted many families to purchase multiple consoles. So while the Nintendo Switch moved almost 3 million units in March alone, there are still many people who have yet to even see it on store shelves. It’s not looking like the shortage will end anytime soon, regardless of Nintendo’s willingness to bolster production. Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima is determined not to sell the Switch at a loss, and the company is already doing costly   deliveries to get the console from the production line to retailers as fast as possible. If you are interested in getting a Switch, be prepared to hunt  —   even through this year’s distant but inexorable holiday season.

23272,Fake News: Three Mainstream Media Lies on Trump’s First Day,"The mainstream media lost no time in attempting to undermine President Donald Trump, as opposed to actually reporting information. [After eight years of kowtowing to Obama, they have suddenly discovered a civic responsibility to hold the government accountable. But they are focusing on minutiae, and in some cases actually telling lies, both of omission and commission. That risks alienating the public even further  —   making it harder, actually, for the media to act as watchdogs.  Lie #1: President Trump was focused on the crowd size at the inauguration. He mentioned it in passing in his speech at the CIA, and Press Secretary Sean Spicer took the media to task for trying to downplay attendance figures. But to say  —   as CNN’s Anderson Cooper did  —   that crowd size was Trump’s focus on his first day in office is simply absurd. On Cooper’s program Saturday, CNN played a clip of Spicer’s first press conference that only mentioned the crowd size issue  —   leaving out Spicer’s preceding comments taking a journalist to task for reporting, falsely, that Trump had a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. removed from the Oval Office. The crowd issue was secondary  —   but CNN chose to focus on it because it was less of a   against the media than the bust. Whatever the numbers on Inauguration Day, Spicer’s point was that the media were more interesting in undermining Trump, and promoting   protests, than in covering the actual news of the day. Lie #2: President Trump insulted the CIA. Extending the faux outrage at Lie #1, the mainstream media criticized Trump for talking about crowd size in front of the CIA’s memorial wall for agents who have died in the course of their duties. The media showed considerably less concern when President Barack Obama spoke before the same wall about the release of the prior administration’s interrogation memos, impugning the integrity of the CIA and giving valuable intelligence to terrorists. @AceofSpadesHQ @jaketapper ¯’_( ツ) ¯ CNN: In CIA visit, Obama defends interrogation memo releasehttps:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Trigger Warning  (@AshLikeSnow17) January 22, 2017,  Lie #3: The   protests in Washington, D. C. were important. The protests were nothing more than the venting of outrage at Trump’s election. For all the talk of “women’s rights,” there was nothing particular to point to that Trump had done about anything relating to women. The demonstration was large, but also disorganized, as well as vulgar, and protesters left heaps of trash over the various routes they took, including protest signs abandoned at Union Station as they left the capital.

23275,Pentagon Says Airstrikes Targeted 2 Qaeda Leaders in Afghanistan - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The United States military carried out airstrikes on Sunday in eastern Afghanistan aimed at two of Al Qaeda’s most senior leaders operating in the country, an attack described as one of the most significant in Afghanistan in several years, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday. An official statement said the Defense Department continued to assess whether the two men, Faruq   and Bilal   were killed in the airstrikes. Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, said on Wednesday night that “their demise would represent a significant blow to the terrorist group’s presence in Afghanistan. ” He said the attacks came after an extensive period of surveillance over remote areas of Kunar Province. Mr. Qatani was described as Al Qaeda’s emir for northeastern Afghanistan, assigned by the terrorist group’s leadership to   havens for operations throughout the country. Mr. Cook called him a “senior planner for attacks against the United States,” with a long history of directing strikes against American and NATO forces. Mr. Utabi, similarly, was described as having worked to   a haven in Afghanistan from which to threaten the West, and was involved in efforts to recruit and train foreign fighters. A United States official said the airstrikes  —   carried out by unmanned warplanes  —   occurred simultaneously on Sunday against two separate compounds in remote areas of Kunar Province. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer details of the mission, said the armed drones fired multiple Hellfire missiles on each compound, causing extensive damage to those structures. American officials had been searching for Mr. Qatani for four years, and the effort to locate and attack him required extensive work by multiple agencies, the Pentagon said. Mr. Qatani had several roles within Al Qaeda, Defense Department officials said. Besides planning attacks against American and coalition forces in Afghanistan, he also raised funds and oversaw weapons acquisition and distribution of arms to militants in the country. Mr. Qatani had connections to Osama bin Laden, and figures prominently in declassified files recovered during the raid on the Bin Laden compound in Pakistan in 2011, officials said. Those seized materials show that Mr. Qatani, also known as Nayf Salam Muhammad Ujaym   has been involved in the relocation of Qaeda operatives from northern Pakistan into Afghanistan over several years. United States military forces remain in Afghanistan to advise and assist Afghan troops and to carry out counterterrorism missions against Islamic State and Qaeda fighters, even after the end of the official combat mission in Afghanistan was declared in 2014. In August, the Pentagon announced that it had killed the leader of the Islamic State branch in Afghanistan and Pakistan with an airstrike on July 26 in eastern Afghanistan.",0
23276,China Showcases Advanced Missile Following Mattis Visit to Japan - Breitbart,"China has unveiled a new advanced missile government officials say can hit regional rivals India, Japan, and Taiwan, just days after Defense Secretary James Mattis left the region. [The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) recently released a video of a military drill in China featuring the     ballistic missile, according to the Indian publication Hindustan Times.  State media reports did not reveal when or where the drill took place, but Beijing released the video a day after Mattis left Tokyo on Saturday, concluding his first trip abroad as defense secretary. “Obviously we watch Chinese military developments with great interest. That they in and of itself is not cause for concern,” Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters during an   press briefing at the Pentagon. “Where we have concerns, and where we express our concerns, is when they unilaterally change the status quo, such as reclaiming and remilitarizing islands that are under dispute or in ways that otherwise bring additional tension or additional uncertainty to the region,” he said. Mattis said during a joint press conference with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada on Saturday that a U. S. policy recognizing islands at the center of a territorial dispute between China and Japan remains the same. “Today the minister and I discussed the security situation and I made clear that our longstanding policy on the Senkaku Islands stands. The United States will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands, and as such article five of the U. S.  Security Treaty applies,” he said. The following day after those remarks, China sent three Chinese Coast Guard vessels around those islands, located in the East China Sea, according to the Japan Coast Guard. “Three ships entered the waters surrounding the uninhabited chain,” the Japan Coast Guard said in a statement, according to the Times. Chinese state media outlet China Daily also issued a veiled threat to neighbors that the new advanced missile, first unveiled in September 2015, could challenge “foreign military installations” on the islands. The article also quoted a retired Chinese major general saying the missile has a strike range of 1, 000 kilometers, which would make it able to reach Okinawa, Japan. The Pentagon said Tuesday it watches Chinese military developments “with great interest. ” U. S. tensions with China have risen since President Trump entered office. Shortly after defeating Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, Trump accepted a phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai   challenging longtime U. S. diplomatic protocol and angering Chinese leaders who consider the country a breakaway province. A commentary on the PLA’s website on the day Trump assumed office said the chances of war had become “more real. ”",0

23278,"Democratic Vice-President: “Whites Should Be The Minority, No One Else”","According the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, white people need to experience the kind “oppression” that black people have experienced before Americans can truly be equal. The cat is out of the bag. 
Via TruthAndAction 

Many who believed that all of these movements and protests started by Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers and their supporters aren’t about equality at all, they’re about racial superiority, specifically over white people. In fact, if you look up “racism” in the dictionary, it’s basically defined as one race seeking racial superiority.
Video Evidence Below. While speaking to a group of baptists in New Orleans, Tim Kaine suggested that in order to achieve equality between races, white people must willingly submit themselves to a state of repression. What exactly is he talking about exactly? Nobody will deny that slavery and the acts that followed were atrocious, but like it’s been asked many times, what right does anybody have to claim offense at acts they weren’t alive to be offended by?
Why can’t anybody see that this kind of policy isn’t going to bridge the racial divide, it’s only going to make it bigger. It’s this type of thinking, created by the Obama Administration, that got us here in the first place. Not to mention that these types of policies are bad even for white democrats.
These are the types of politics being put into place by democrats and the left as a whole. The sad thing about it is that what black people don’t realize is that these policies only sound good to them because it puts down white people. However, it doesn’t really do anything for them except make them dependent on the government. We’re all hamsters to them, looking for pellets.
The ever-increasing rate at which good-paying, blue-collar jobs are being off-shored by bad trade deals — something to which the modern Democratic Party appears committed fully — will continue to have a devastating effect on working-class white communities. The disproportionately negative effect globalization has had on blue-collar whites was a large factor in GOP nominee Donald Trump’s success in the GOP primaries.
Moreover, this destruction of the middle American economy is having very real, very negative effects on white Americans. “Something startling is happening to middle-aged white Americans,” The New York Times reported in 2015. “Unlike every other age group, unlike every other racial and ethnic group, unlike their counterparts in other rich countries, death rates in this group have been rising, not falling.”
Some of the Democratic Party’s favorite progressive policies — like affirmative action — are directly and openly discriminatory against white Americans. Moreover, the Supreme Court’s decision this summer in Fisher v. University of Texas gave legal sanction to this obvious form of anti-white discrimination.
Then there’s the Democratic Party’s stringent support for open borders and mass non-white migration, which is quite literally turning white Americans into a minority in the country their own ancestors built. White Americans are already a minority among school-aged children, and will be a nationwide minority by 2050, according to predictions by the Census Bureau.
According to democrats, resistance to their cause is rooted in racism and a desire to protect “white-privilege”. If anybody really took the time to think about it, they’d know that that’s racism in itself, trying to breathe life into a myth. The left wants that racist curtain to continue to divide Americans down the middle by making one race look like monsters, mainly white people. This is a toxic form of politics, and will lead to America’s downfall, should it be allowed to continue. This will be Hillary’s America.

23279,Mexico Ends Its Soccer Frustration on U.S. Soil - The New York Times,"COLUMBUS, Ohio  —   For years, the score was so ingrained it became a mantra. A rallying cry. A marketing device, even. Four straight times, the United States men’s soccer team faced Mexico in a home World Cup qualifying game here, and four straight times the Americans won by the same score  —     or, as it became known to everyone on both sides, Dos a Cero. The fans chanted it. The players talked about it. The television commercials plastered it all over their advertisements. But no more. Dos a Cero was officially put to rest only 20 minutes into Friday’s game when Mexico’s Miguel Layún scored with a deflected shot from outside the penalty area, and the visitors put a complete damper on the lively atmosphere at Mapfre Stadium with a late winner from the seemingly ageless Rafael Márquez to seal a    —   call it Dos a Uno?  —   defeat for the Americans. It was the first home World Cup qualifier setback for the United States since a loss to Honduras in 2001  —   a stretch of 32 games  —   and Mexico’s first win in a qualifier in the United States since 1972. The United States still has nine games left in this   final round of qualifying  —   the top three teams advance to Russia in 2018  —   but things are now difficult right from the start. The Americans travel to San Jose, Costa Rica, for what should be a tricky match against the host country on Tuesday. Before then, they will have a chance to review what was, as Coach Jurgen Klinsmann put it, a “very disappointing” loss to their biggest rivals. After a stunted start to the game, the United States played significantly better in the second half and had openings to win, only to switch off completely on a corner kick that allowed Márquez to flick in a header in the 89th minute. “It’s soft,” forward Jozy Altidore said. “It’s really soft, and we have to be better than that. ” Klinsmann singled out defender John Brooks as having failed to pick up Márquez, who is 37 and has been a Mexican mainstay for so long that he played in the first Dos a Cero game back in 2001. Brooks appeared to think that Altidore was going to run with Márquez, but either way it was a critical mistake at a most inopportune time. “We’ll let ourselves hurt tonight,” goalkeeper Tim Howard said. “Then we’ve got to move on. There’s a lot of games left. ” Howard is unlikely to take part in at least the next match. The longtime American goalkeeper injured his groin while taking a goal kick in the first half. He was replaced by Brad Guzan, who is expected to start against Costa Rica, about five minutes before halftime. Klinsmann started Friday’s game in a    alignment that was designed to give the wunderkind Christian Pulisic freedom “to roam,” the coach said. Pulisic was active enough, but other midfielders like Michael Bradley and Jermaine Jones did not challenge the Mexican players in the way Klinsmann had hoped. So, after Mexico hit the post, the crossbar and  —   on Layún’s shot  —   the back of the net, the Americans went into a more classic   . That “calmed things down,” Klinsmann said, and the United States pushed the ball well after halftime and tied the score at   in the 49th minute when Brooks passed to Altidore, who bulled toward the goal and laid the ball in front of Bobby Wood for a sharp finish. That sent the crowd of 24, 650 into delirium, but their glee was dulled as the United States failed to crack the Mexican defense again while Márquez took his chance with aplomb. Dos a Cero was over. The American dominance of Mexico in Columbus was over. The magic, after 15 years, was over. “We had enough chances to put it away,” Klinsmann said. “But we didn’t. ”",0
23280,"News: Major Headache: The Blue Angels Got Trapped Inside A Costco, And No One Knows How To Get Them Back Outside","Email 
Well, this isn’t good. 
Most people think of Costco as the place that sells bulk quantities of pretty much everything. But the warehouse superstore is now making headlines for a very different reason, and it could serve to tarnish their brand: The Blue Angels accidentally flew into the Costco in Augusta, GA and are currently stuck flying around inside the discount retailer. 
Worst of all, it doesn’t seem like Costco has any idea how to get the airplane stunt squadron to leave. 
The Blue Angels were performing at a routine air show in Augusta, GA earlier today when they veered too close to the Costco and zipped through the automatic doors as they slid open for a customer. Before Costco employees could react, the diamond formation of five F/A-18 Hornets had entered the store and began performing death-defying aerial feats right over the shelves of bulk cereals and jumbo-size ketchups. 
Customers are trying to ignore the roaring jets overhead, but it’s hard to concentrate on your shopping list when sonic booms keep knocking over pallets of Kirkland-brand dog food. It’s usually a welcome treat to see the Blue Angels conduct synchronized barrel rolls, but inside Costco, the elite pilots are proving to be a serious nuisance. 
So far all attempts to evict the Blue Angels have proved unsuccessful. At first, Costco staff just propped the front door open with a bucket, assuming the Blue Angels would find their way back out eventually. After an hour, when choreographed smoke trails continued to plague the store, the manager grabbed a lacrosse stick from a sporting goods display and tried to shoo the planes toward the exit. Unfortunately, that only caused the Blue Angels to accelerate to 700 mph and perform several loop-the-loops in the freezer aisle, where the pilots hit a truly exhilarating 8 G’s. 
Your heart just has to break for this poor manager. 
With the store set to close in only a few hours, Costco better think up a solution fast, or Blue Angels will be locked in overnight. If that happens, then tomorrow’s customers will be aggravated by more of the same world-class aeronautic showmanship. What an absolute hassle.",0
23281,"Microsoft Employees Sue Company over PTSD Suffered from Filtering Child Porn, Murder - Breitbart","Two members of Microsoft’s Online Safety Team are suing the company, citing   stress and auditory hallucinations after being made to filter through and remove videos and pictures of child porn, murder, and bestiality as part of their job. [“Members of Microsoft’s Online Safety Team had ‘ ’ status, former employees Henry Soto and Greg Blauert allege in a lawsuit filed on Dec. 30. They ‘could literally view any customer’s communications at any time,’” reported the Daily Beast. “Specifically, they were asked to screen Microsoft users’ communications for child pornography and evidence of other crimes. ”  “But Big Brother didn’t offer a good health care plan, the Microsoft employees allege. After years of being made to watch the ‘most twisted’ videos on the internet, employees said they suffered severe psychological distress, while the company allegedly refused to provide a specially trained therapist or to pay for therapy,” the report alleges. “The two former employees and their families are suing for damages from what they describe as permanent psychological injuries, for which they were denied worker’s compensation. ” Soto, who was one of the first employees in the department, claims to have been “involuntarily transferred” to the position, adding that he was “not informed prior to the transfer as to the full nature” of the job. Soto was also forced to remain in the position for at least a year and a half before being able to request another transfer —   the usual practice for any position at Microsoft. As part of the job, Soto claimed that he had to watch and filter through “horrible brutality, murder, indescribable sexual assaults, videos of humans dying and, in general, videos and photographs designed to entertain the most twisted and   people in the world. ” “Many people simply cannot imagine what Mr. Soto had to view on a daily basis as most people do not understand how horrible and inhumane the worst people in the world can be,” proclaimed the lawsuit, adding, “He had trouble with sleep disturbance, [and] nightmares. ” “He suffered from an internal video screen in his head and could see disturbing images, he suffered from irritability, increased startle, anticipatory anxiety, and was easily distractible,” the lawsuit claims. Microsoft defended the department and its employees, citing the importance of the job in an email. “Microsoft applies     technology to help detect and classify illegal images of child abuse and exploitation that are shared by users on Microsoft Services,” responded a Microsoft spokesperson to the Daily Beast. “Once verified by a specially trained employee, the company removes the image, reports it to the National Center for Missing  Exploited Children, and bans the users who shared the images from our services. We have put in place robust wellness programs to ensure the employees who handle this material have the resources and support they need. ” However the “wellness program” allegedly consisted of just an “  counselor,” which resulted in a “compassion fatigue” diagnosis, instead of the   mental health program that was allegedly available for Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit. Greg Blauert, who is also currently suing Microsoft, cited similar concerns about the job, declaring that he had to sift through “thousands of images of child pornography, adult pornography and bestiality that graphically depicted the violence and depravity of the perpetrators. ” “He began experiencing nightmares and intrusive images,” claimed the Daily Beast. “If he or a   broke down at work, their employers allegedly encouraged them to merely ‘leave work early’ as part of the department’s ‘Wellness Plan. ’” Both men have been diagnosed with PTSD and are currently on leave from work.

23284,"Report: Roman Polanski to Return to U.S., Settle Child Rape Case","Fugitive director Roman Polanski will reportedly attempt to have his   child rape case resolved so that he may return to the United States without fear of arrest or incarceration. [According to TMZ, the    director’s attorney, Harland Braun, has asked a Los Angeles judge to review what it reports is a “  transcript” of the prosecutor’s testimony during Polanski’s trial.  The attorney claims the transcript proves that the Pianist director had agreed to a plea deal to serve just 48 days in jail, and that the judge had agreed to the deal. Polanski was convicted of raping a child after a photo shoot in Los Angeles in 1977 and spent 42 days in prison before being released. But the director later fled the country for Europe when he feared that the judge in his case backed out of the deal and suggested prosecutors give him 50 years in prison. According to TMZ, Polanski’s victim has asked the judge to close the case without giving the director any more jail time. Polanski has lived mainly in France in the years since he fled the United States, though he also holds Polish citizenship. The director has escaped extradition several times in the decades since his conviction, most recently in December, when Poland’s Supreme Court rejected a request by a lower court to have him returned to U. S. custody. Polanski last attempted to return to the U. S. in 2014, when his attorneys filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department, claiming the agency engaged in “serious misconduct” while prosecuting and attempting to extradite the director.

Regan Pifer writes that everyone should donate to the Clinton Foundation immediately! 
After all, it takes hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Bill and Hillary, along with the Clinton Foundation board members, to fly around the world in their Boeing 757, and to stay in $13,900/night villas with a 60-foot swimming pool. 
That kind of luxury ain’t going to pay for itself! 
Oh, and–in between the opulence and indulgence–former president Bill Clinton and his donors stopped to serve “meals to 250 underprivileged children” in Jaipur, India on July 16, 2014. 
I wonder how many more meals, medicine, or school supplies could have been provided with an extra $13,900. 
This is a typical Clinton Foundation site visit. 
According to The Daily Caller : 
The trip provides a glimpse into the lavish lifestyle of the Clinton Foundation and dozens of its wealthiest donors — all done in the name of charity, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation… 
The Clinton excesses on this particular trip were seen in several Third World nations. Indonesian officials, for example, warned the foundation that Pangkalan Bun Airport’s landing strip was too short for the Boeing 757 and that the party would have to switch to a smaller aircraft. 
Officially, the Indonesian stop was to visit a Clinton Climate Initiative project where a local forest preserve was being cultivated to offset carbon emissions. But flying 41 people — donors, their families and foundation staff — aboard an aircraft designed for nearly 300 sent the trip’s “carbon footprint” sky high… 
…[T]he 757 and Gulfstream burned 60,000 gallons of jet fuel, worth at least $220,000 using current commercial aviation rates. 
Sixty thousands gallons of jet fuel produced 200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, enough energy to power 21 average U.S. homes for a year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It would fuel a passenger car 478,000 miles in a year. 
The Clinton entourage’s carbon dioxide consumption exceeded a year’s total emissions by countries like Guinea-Bissau, Tonga, the British Virgin Islands, Lichtenstein and the Solomon Islands, according to the World Bank . 
The Clinton Foundation led a workshop in what not to do –a mismanagement of funds and resources for the gluttonous indulgence of donors.

23287,White House Officials Suggest Openness to ’Immigration Reform’ - Breitbart,"Top White House officials told media outlets on Tuesday that they’re open to a compromise deal on immigration. [But the new reports lack any details about what compromise would be acceptable to President Donald Trump or the     voters who elected him into power.  CNN reported Tuesday that, The President is thinking about adding the topic to his speech tonight to a joint session of Congress, though either way an immigration bill remains a desire for his first term. The topic of enforcing current immigration laws is already in the speech, the official said. The actual details of any proposal are vital because every faction in the huge political dispute over imported   labor says they want a compromise. In 2013, for example, the eight senators who drafted the   “Gang of Eight” immigration bill claimed their bill was a compromise  —   even though it would have gutted sanctions for   employers, granted an   amnesty to millions of illegals, increased the inflow of refugees, and doubled the annual inflow of legal immigrants to roughly 2 million per year.   reformers have pushed their own compromises, which include an amnesty for the 11   illegals in the nation in exchange for sharp reductions in annual legal immigration plus   rules to sanction employers who hire illegal immigrants. That’s the     supported by Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, who notes that any overhaul of immigration law requires some purchased support from some   Democrats. In his winning 2016 campaign, Donald Trump won huge public support because of his opposition to amnesty and to   policies, and because of his promise to “buy American and hire American. ” In one 2016 speech, he urged a cutback in legal immigration to historical norms. He also called for a temporary pause in legal immigration, while repeating his promise for a wall that would stop illegal immigration. In August 2015, his policy paper declared: We need to control the admission of new   workers in order to: help wages grow, get teenagers back to work, aid minorities’ rise into the middle class, help schools and communities falling behind, and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the American dream. On Feb. 9, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the president is still opposed to the 2013 “Gang of Eight” bill. But if Trump were to reverse his     policies, he’d likely face severe political problems in 2018 and 2020. According to CNN, “It has to be a negotiation,” the official said, arguing that the bill theoretically could make people on both the “far right” and “far left” happy. “It could be good for everyone,” the senior administration official said. “People are exhausted” from debating the topic. Any immigration reductions would be a strategic problem for Democrats because they are hoping that the rising tide of immigrant voters will bring them into power. Any reduction is also a problem for Wall Street investors because their   calculations assume a growing population of   immigrant consumers.",0

23298,Trump: I Thought Comey Firing Would Have Bipartisan Support - Breitbart,"Thursday at a joint news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, President Donald Trump said he believed his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey would have bipartisan support.  When asked if he urged Comey to close down the investigation into Michael Flynn? Trump said, “No. No. Next question. ” Trump explained, “I think it is totally ridiculous. Everybody thinks so. Again, we have to get back to working our country properly so that we can take care of the problems that we have. We have plenty of problems. We have done a fantastic job. We have a tremendous group of people. Millions and millions of people out there that are looking at what you have just said and said, what are they doing? Director Comey was very unpopular with most people. ” “I actually thought when I made that decision —  and I also got a very, very strong recommendation, as you know, from the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but when I made that decision, I actually thought it would be a bipartisan decision. Because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side, not only the Republican side, that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey. ” He continued, “Then he had the very poor performance on Wednesday. That was a poor, poor performance. So poor, in fact, that I believe  —   and you would have to ask him because I don’t like to speak for other people, but I believe that’s why the Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein went out and wrote his very, very strong letter. And then on top of that, after the Wednesday performance by Director Comey, you had a person come and have to readjust the record, which many people have never seen before, because there were misstatements made. I thought that was something that was terrible. We need a great director of the FBI. I cherish the FBI. it is special. all over the world, no matter where you go, the FBI is special. The FBI has not had that special reputation. ” “With what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even you could say directly or indirectly with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign. We’re going to have a director who is going to be outstanding. I will be announcing that director very soon, and I look forward to doing it. I think the people in the FBI will be very, very, very, very thrilled. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0

23306,Polar Bear Fed With Firecracker. This Video Is Nothing But Heartbreaking,"Share on Facebook Polar bears are already endangered species according to the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation. There are many reasons why such creature will be one day extinct, one is animal abuse. A heartbreaking video showing a polar bear writhing in pain, after she was allegedly fed with a firecracker, went viral online and sparked outrage among internet users. The female polar bear who was fighting for her life, can be seen suffering, as blood comes out from her snout. She was twisting in deep pain, while a group of men were recording the scene and discussing what is happening to the bear. According to a report, a Russian military base cook fed the polar bear with a kind of firecracker used by the military. Witnesses said, the bear and her cub were frequently seen around the base looking for food and being fed by the cook. If proven, the alleged cook may spent up to 7 years in prison. Somehow, upon getting in touch with LifeNews, the cook said that the bear who regularly visit the base in Wrangel Island in far east Russia, to get food, had “itself grabbed a rocket flare and began chewing on it.” The cook also stated that the bear did not die and workers were already looking for her, but failed to find her. In contrary, a report said that the bear was shot to death, ending her suffering, but this was not verified. However, it is still unclear what exactly the polar bear ate. According to other versions of the story, it was a rocket flare instead of a firecracker. It is also said that the bear accidentally ate the fire cracker, thinking of it as food while other report suggested that she was tricked into eating an explosive charge concealed in the food fed to her. Nobody knows what exactly happened to the poor bear but experts believed that her chance of survival is slim. Meanwhile, Russia's Military of Natural Resources is hoping for an investigation regarding the disturbing matter. Here's The Heartbreaking Footage: We were given the privilege to think wisely and that's what makes us human, but doing such kind of animal abuse only proves that we are nothing but lower than animals.

23311,"Playwright Tony Kushner Defends Assassination of Trump in ’Julius Caesar,’ Falsely Blames Breitbart for Outrage","Pulitzer   playwright Tony Kushner defended the onstage assassination of a Donald   Julius Caesar in the Public Theater’s contemporary iteration of the play, telling the New York Times in an interview that the Shakespeare classic is supposed to be “upsetting. ”[The Oskar   Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar  —   a modern take on the play in which the main character is dressed to look like the president, and which includes references to tweeting  —   opened Monday night to a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience, according to Variety.  But the play has generated controversy over the Caesar character’s close resemblance to Trump. Some critics have said that the mock assassination of the Trump    —   in a graphic scene filmed and published by Inside Edition last week  —   crossed the line, particularly after another “artwork” depicting Trump’s death, a “beheading” photograph featuring comedian Kathy Griffin, stirred outrage last month. In response to the controversy, Public Theater sponsors Bank of America and Delta Air Lines pulled their support, while American Express clarified that its funding did not go directly toward Shakespeare in the Park and that it did not “condone” the theater’s interpretation of Julius Caesar. Ironically, the companies’ withdrawal of support set off another round of outrage, this time from some celebrities and theater figures, including from Kushner, the   Angels in America playwright. “It’s an upsetting play, but if there’s a production of Julius Caesar that doesn’t upset you, you’re sitting through a very bad production,” Kushner told the New York Times. “It’s clear that the corporate sponsors who pulled out are just being cowardly and caving in to a lot of cranky   people because Breitbart and Fox News told them to. ” Kushner wasn’t the only person to blame Breitbart and other conservative media for the sponsors’ withdrawal in their article for the New York Times about the timeline of the controversy, writers Michael Paulson and Sopan Deb accused Breitbart of having “driven a campaign on social media against the Public [Theater]” that prompted the sponsors to make their decision. Of course, Breitbart News had simply reported on the controversy, and never led a “campaign on social media” against the play. Early stories about the play centered on one theatergoers’s reaction to the graphic assassination scene, while stories about the corporate sponsors pulling out simply reported on the statements that each had made. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Times failed to accurately report on what appeared to be the real reason for the backlash over the play that the level of vitriol against Trump has reached a heightened new level in recent weeks, and that it has now become acceptable to make jokes or art about the assassination of President Trump, and to be celebrated for doing so by theater critics, celebrities and the media.",0
23312,Will Trump Honor the Iran Nuclear Deal? - Russia News Now,"Will Trump Honor the Iran Nuclear Deal? by Stephen Lendman The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is an international agreement involving the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany. Completing it successfully required many months of hard bargaining, Iran giving more than it got in return – to free itself from sanctions imposed solely for political reasons, serving US and Israeli interests mainly. Its nuclear program has no military component, not now or earlier, claims otherwise falsified. Since ending a generation of US-installed Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi rule in 1979, Washington treated the Islamic Republic deplorably. It’s not at war with its neighbors, threatens no one, and advocates a nuclear-free Middle East – Israel the sole regional nuclear armed and dangerous nation, yet nothing is done to contest its arsenal, no JCPOA-type deal to eliminate it. Why challenge Iran? Because it’s a sovereign independent nation Washington doesn’t control. And there’s all their hydrocarbon riches Big Oil wants exploited for its own bottom line interests. On November 25, The Wall Street Journal reported Washington “and its Western allies…pressing pressing Iran to take steps to sharply cut the amount of radioactive material it holds in a bid to shore up last year’s nuclear deal and discourage the incoming Trump administration from abandoning it,” citing unnamed Western officials. Will Trump scrap or renegotiate JCPOA as vowed while campaigning? Highly unlikely. It’s an international agreement, America one of six countries involved plus Iran. Renegotiating what took many months to agree on would begin his tenure on the wrong foot, irresponsibly challenging the other permanent Security Council members plus Germany. He’s more likely to continue a hard line on Tehran in other ways, maintaining illegal US sanctions, maybe adding more, breaching the letter and spirit of JCPOA – instead of responsibly ending 37 years of hostility, treating Iranian sovereignty with the respect it deserves. Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, warned against taking steps to undermine JCPOA terms, stressing Tehran’s full compliance, saying: “The P5+1 countries have a clear responsibility to abide by the JCPOA with good will and in a constructive atmosphere based on mutual respect and through avoiding any steps that run contrary to the text and spirit of the JCPOA and undermine its successful implementation.” Complaints about Tehran exceeding its agreed on heavy water inventory of 130 metric tons were overblown – the issue resolved when 11 tons were sent to Oman days earlier. IAEA director general Yukiya Amano confirmed Iran’s full compliance with JCPOA terms. Last April, he praised the Islamic Republic for exceeding its obligations under the agreement. Washington continues breaching it by maintaining sanctions, imposing new ones since JCPOA’s implementation in January, and failing to unfreeze all Iranian assets. Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago.

In an interview with Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, WikLeaks founder Julian Assange doubled down on a claim he had made last month on Hannity’s radio show, which was the Russian government nor any state party of Russia were the source of hacks that exposed thousands of confidential Democratic Party emails.  “We can say  —   we have said repeatedly over the last two months, our source is not the Russian government and it is not the state party,” Assange said. Assange said the backlash over the hacked emails was nothing more than an effort to “delegitimize” the incoming Trump administration. “So why such a dramatic response?” he added. “Well, the answer is obvious  —   they’re trying to delegitimize the Trump administration as it goes into the White House.

23316,Studies: Poles Are Shifting And Earth's Magnetic Field Is About To Collapse,"Scientists believe that our magnetic poles are shifting. In fact, they could even flip in our lifetime. The South Pole has changed its location drastically, and the North Pole is moving across the Arctic Ocean at a pretty rapid pace. If this keeps occurring the Earth’s magnetic field could collapse and cause power outages on epic levels.


The Earth’s magnetic field is also what shields us from much solar radiation. It appears to be weakening, and experts don’t know why. At a rate of around 5% per century, the Earth’s magnetic field has been diminishing for the last 400 or so years.

What would happen if the magnetic poles were to flip? 

First, the magnetosphere would weaken, and our planet would no longer be protected from solar radiation. In turn, the radiation would burn off large portions of our atmosphere and make Earth uninhabitable for mankind. In the process weather patterns would drastically change and entire power grids would go down and not be able to be brought back on line.

Is it really happening? Many people believe so, and you can see from the attached video that unprecedented insights have been formed on the Earth’s magnetic field. Also, accompanying reports show trends of our planets magnetic field weakening and it’s poles moving at a rate of around forty miles a year.


With a pole shift we can expect weather patterns that would be unlike anything expected before. Floods, hurricanes, and tornados will be much more common and will happen in areas where they did not use to occur. Earthquakes and other planetary happenings will be on par to bring about extinction events . 

Measurements do confirm this to be true; the North Pole appears to be heading towards Siberia and the South Pole will follow suit at the opposite end of the planet. So, Yes, Yes it is happening, and it has already started. This is true, though while the field is weak, it allows more space debris to come our way a lot more often, the magnetic field also helps to deflect objects. Mars may have been hit because it lost its shield and then most of its atmosphere. If life has once flourished on Mars then life reestablished itself here then I hope we learn from the mistakes and don't repeat them.

23320,EBOLA VICTIM RISES FROM THE DEAD IN AFRICA,"posted by Eddie In a surprising twist to the Ebola outbreak story, the Liberian Government has accused the United States of purposely spreading the Ebola Virus in an attempt to test a weaponized form of the virus. An unfortunate unintended consequence. VERY REAL CONCERN OF A ZOMBIE OUTBREAK The crime against humanity is that victims of Ebola are now rising from the dead in this besieged African nation. Captured footage shows a man rising after mortally succumbing to the Ebola virus. The name of this victim is being withheld by the World Health Organization out of alleged privacy concerns. Some believe concerns for the safety of the Man’s. The family is the real reason for the embargo of his identity. It is believed the original form of the weaponized virus has mutated into what can only be described as a zombie virus. With Texas now struggling with an outbreak of Ebola, there is a fear of the undead evolving into a new form of an undocumented worker, and being a very deadly one at that. The State of Kansas is concerned not only about the Ebola outbreak of it’s neighbor to the South, but also is very concerned with regards to a resulting outbreak of Zombies. Sam Brownback, the Governor of Kansas, has issued an executive order declaring October “Zombie Awareness Month”. KANSAS ON HIGH ALERT OVER ZOMBIE OUTBREAK? The State of Kansas rests in a state of high alert over this very real concern of a zombie outbreak. Mailings of pamphlets are being sent out across Kansas warning its citizens how to prevent both Ebola and the resulting zombie attack. Note that this story is in its infant stage and is rapidly developing. It is expected that Ebola will overtake 5 million more victims in the next two months and left untreated will result in certain death. With this strain of the Ebola virus spawning zombies, it is unknown as to what catastrophe awaits the yet uninformed public. It is important to continue following this story in the media as to be better prepared for when this outbreak reaches your community.

23323,HuffPo Accidentally Makes Badass Video of Steve Bannon,"In an attempt to paint White House chief strategist Steve Bannon as a dangerous warmonger and ideologue, the Huffington Post unwittingly created a badass highlight reel of some of Bannon’s greatest hits. [The video includes Bannon’s comments expressing concern over the imminent clash of civilizations between a demoralized   West and an increasingly militant radical Islamic world.  Bannon has argued over the years that the civilizational struggle with radical Islam, along with the corrupt crony capitalism of “the Party of Davos,” the dehumanizing secularization of the West, and the ambitions of emerging superpowers like China, were all converging into a global conflict not unlike the one faced by the World War II generation. The generational theory about “four turnings” formed the basis for Bannon’s acclaimed documentary Generation Zero about the 2008 financial crisis. The term comes from the book The Fourth Turning by William Strauss and Neil Howe, who argued that American history can be charted in a cycle of four stages, concluding with a crisis period that emerges every 80 years. According to this theory, the last crisis was nearly 80 years ago with World War II and hence, the next crisis will soon be upon us. Watch the video above.",0
23324,"Regardless of How America Votes, Americans Want a Different Foreign Policy","Written by Ron Paul Monday November 7, 2016 I have said throughout this presidential campaign that it doesn’t matter much which candidate wins. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are authoritarians and neither can be expected to roll back the leviathan state that destroys our civil liberties at home while destroying our economy and security with endless wars overseas. Candidates do not matter all that much, despite what the media would have us believe. Ideas do matter, however. And regardless of which of these candidates is elected, the battle of ideas now becomes critical. The day after the election is our time to really focus our efforts on making the case for a peaceful foreign policy and the prosperity it will bring. While we may not have much to cheer in Tuesday’s successful candidate, we have learned a good deal about the state of the nation from the campaigns. From the surprising success of the insurgent Bernie Sanders to a Donald Trump campaign that broke all the mainstream Republican Party rules – and may have broken the Republican Party itself – what we now understand more clearly than ever is that the American people are fed up with politics as usual. And more importantly they are fed up with the same tired old policies. Last month a fascinating poll was conducted by the Center for the National Interest and the Charles Koch Institute. A broad ranging 1,000 Americans were asked a series of questions about US foreign policy and the 15 year “war on terror.” You might think that after a decade and a half, trillions of dollars, and thousands of lives lost, Americans might take a more positive view of this massive effort to “rid the world of evil-doers,” as then-president George W. Bush promised. But the poll found that only 14 percent of Americans believe US foreign policy has made them more safe! More than 50 percent of those polled said the next US president should use less force overseas, and 80 percent said the president must get authorization from Congress before taking the country to war. These results should make us very optimistic about our movement, as it shows that we are rapidly approaching the “critical mass” where new ideas will triumph over the armies of the status quo. We know those in Washington with a vested interest in maintaining a US empire overseas will fight to the end to keep the financial gravy train flowing. The neocons and the liberal interventionists will continue to preach that we must run the world or everything will fall to ruin. But this election and many recent polls demonstrate that their time has passed. They may not know it yet, but their failures are too obvious and Americans are sick of paying for them. What is to be done? We must continue to educate ourselves and others. We must resist those who are preaching “interventionism-lite” and calling it a real alternative. Claiming we must protect our “interests” overseas really means using the US military to benefit special interests. That is not what the military is for. We must stick to our non-interventionist guns. No more regime change. No more covert destabilization programs overseas. A solid defense budget, not an imperial military budget. US troops home now. End US military action in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and so on. Just come home. Americans want change, no matter who wins. We need to be ready to provide that alternative.

23325,New Gallup Poll Reveals What Americans REALLY Think About Gun Control,"You are here: Home / US / New Gallup Poll Reveals What Americans REALLY Think About Gun Control New Gallup Poll Reveals What Americans REALLY Think About Gun Control October 28, 2016 Pinterest 
A new Gallup poll found that a record low number of Americans, just 36%, favor a ban on “assault rifles,” also known as standard semiautomatic sport rifles. This is the lowest number seen in the 20 years since Gallup first asked Americans the question. 
Gallup reported : 
The fewest Americans in 20 years favor making it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess semi-automatic guns known as assault rifles. Thirty-six percent now want an assault weapons ban, down from 44% in 2012 and 57% when Gallup first asked the question in 1996. 
Assault rifles have been a contentious issue in American life for decades. Two years after President Bill Clinton signed a federal assault weapons ban in 1994, Gallup found that a solid majority of Americans favored such a ban. By the time the 10-year ban expired in 2004, Americans were evenly divided. And by 2011, public opinion had tilted against the assault weapons ban, with 53% opposed and 43% in favor. In Gallup’s 2016 Crime poll, conducted Oct. 5-9, opposition now exceeds support by 25 percentage points, 61% to 36%. 
Support for a ban on assault rifles has waned across party lines, though the level of support has dropped most markedly among Republicans. Among Democrats, 50 percent support a ban whereas just 25 percent of Republicans do. In 1996, Democrats supported a ban on assault rifles at a rate of 63 percent along with 50 percent of Republicans. 
For independents, the trend is downward as well. In 2000, 63 percent of independents backed a ban on assault rifles, but now that number is all the way down to 31 percent. 
People who own guns aren’t the only ones who care about the issue, either. For people who don’t have a gun in the home, 55 percent supported banning assault rifles in 2004; today, the number is down 10 points at 45 percent. 
In 2004, 44 percent of those in households with a gun supported an assault weapons ban, but today that number has shrunk to 26 percent — which represents an all-time low. 
Gallup reported that this trend fits an overall trend of decreasing support for strict gun laws — particularly relative to the levels seen in 1990: 
The decline in support for an assault weapons ban mirrors the trend for those saying there should be a law banning the possession of handguns, except by the police or other authorized people. Currently, 23% of Americans favor such a ban, down from 26% in 2011 and 36% in 2004. 
At the same time, 55% of Americans say laws covering the sale of firearms should be made more strict, with 10% saying the laws should be less strict and 34% saying they should be kept as they are now. The percentage favoring stricter gun laws has fluctuated between 43% and 60% since 2004, with no clear increase or decrease in support. But it is down from levels consistently at or above 60% in the 1990s, including a high of 78% in 1990. 
Maybe people are starting to see through the media’s narrative that getting rid of guns will keep us safe? Many Americans know how important the Second Amendment is and are unwilling to let the government scare them into giving up their right and cede more power to the federal government. 
Good, hopefully more people wake up and refuse to give up their rights.",0

Anderson Cooper is known to be the cool, mild-mannered news host of CNN's AC 360. But the shade he threw on Newt Gingrich after his rant against Megyn Kelly was nothing short of scorching. 
“I’m sick and tired of people like you using language that’s inflammatory, that’s not true!” Gingrich exploded on The Kelly File. “When you use the words, you took a position. And I think it’s very unfair of you to do that!” 
Then, the former Speaker went for the throat: 
“You wanna go back through the tapes of your show recently? You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy! That’s what I get out of watching you tonight!” 
Anderson Cooper noticed something unusual about Gingrich's line of attack: 
“For Newt Gingrich to accuse Megyn Kelly of being fascinated by sex,” Cooper stated. “This is a guy, who’s what, on his third marriage, cheated on his first two wives and was having an affair when he was impeaching Bill Clinton. Isn’t that right?” 
That's about right. Newt Gingrich admitted to cheating on his first and second wives and having an affair during the Clinton impeachment hearings. 
Watch the segment: 
Trump supporters may not be pleased with the way Megyn Kelly has commented on all of those accusations, and her throwing doubt upon Juanita Broaddrick's rape claims against Bill Clinton did not win her friends in that camp. But love her or hate her, it's not Megyn's job to be the Trump campaign's unofficial spokeswoman. 
It may be her job to assume the role of a news commentator, however, rather than that of an “objective” journalist. The idea that there is “objectivity” when it comes to reporting the news is a tired and dangerous cliche the American people should put to rest. 
As for being “fascinated by sex,” it just might be that Kelly is professionally interested in sexual assault and groping allegations against a presidential candidate, unfounded or otherwise, since the way those are perceived by the public just might sway a national election. ",0

Now Hillary and the foreign agent in the people’s White House, Barack Hussein Obama, are being exposed for voter rigging . Obama has been visited 45 times out of his 340 visits to the White House by election rigging guru and former prison inmate Robert Creamer . 
The new scapegoat for Obama and Clinton is Russia. They are now being blamed for the crime when it is Clinton and Obama who are literally exposed in their own corruptions. 
America, do not be diverted from these diplomatic magicians from hell (John 8:44-45). The Clintons have been selling uranium ore to the Russians . This is now World Wrestling Entertainment on a global scale, as they continue to play off of each other. They are not archenemies. They are allied in crime together, period. 
Furthermore, like that of the Bushes, China, Russia and America, as well as the Pope, they are all calling for the new world. They are allied with the covenant of Hell, which I remind you disannulled (Isaiah 28:15-18). 
Many are wondering why Hillary Clinton is even up on the platform during debates. It comes to this, the American people have been soft on these corrupt criminals, and have been soft on themselves. However, God will not be soft (Nahum 1:3), and these corrupt individuals have been encouraged to act out in a more corrupt manner. 
Americans have also allowed the appeasers that identify themselves as prosecutors and government oversight to talk big . Yet, they produce nothing when it comes to justice (Amos 5:7). They are the fox in the chicken coop, acting as if they actually mean what they say. They are protecting themselves as much as the establishment in which they are a part. 
Then there are those who pose as some sort of patriotic representatives when, in fact, they are the same people that have given Barack a pass every step of the way. These are a few of those who are the establishment: Colin Powell",0
23328,"Hillary Arrives At Rally, Makes One Weird Move That Left Onlookers Puzzled","Hillary Arrives At Rally, Makes One Weird Move That Left Onlookers Puzzled Posted on October 27, 2016 by Alisha Rich in Politics Share This 
As Hillary Clinton makes her last few rounds of appearances before election day, the presidential hopeful will feel a little bit of the pressure that the presidency will demand. However, when she arrived at her rally in Lake Worth, Florida, she attempted to make one move that she hoped no one would notice. 
There have been many questions over the course of Hillary Clinton’s campaign regarding her health. As a result of her age and her lifestyle, there’s no doubt that her body is starting to feel the effects of aging – whether she likes to admit it or not. 
However, video footage of her recent rally in Florida shows how desperate she is to keep her health problems hidden, but her attempt was met with failure the moment she hit the stage. In fact, the Democratic presidential candidate struggled to climb one single step. The video captures one of her aides rushing towards her side as she attempted to climb up the riser. 
“She needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness,” according to The American Mirror . “The aide extended his hand and Clinton held on tightly as she made her way up the 18 inches.” 
Although Hillary Clinton insists that her health isn’t an issue, the number of incidents she has had paints quite a different picture. If you take a close look at the video, the aide can even be seen standing behind her, reaching for her waist – probably preparing for the event of her falling. 
We have said it time and time again – she’s not fit to be president. Although her health is a major concern considering how demanding the presidency can be on a person, it’s her disastrous political history that raises, even more, concerns.",0
23329,Should Russia rejoice at Donald Trump's victory?,"Should Russia rejoice at Donald Trump's victory? 09.11.2016 The head of the Civil Society Development Fund, Konstantin Kostin, is certain that the victory of presidential candidate Donald Trump has demonstrated people's disappointment in the old American elite. ""No one was expecting Trump to win. They did not expect the Republicans to take the majority at the Senate elections. This speaks of people's disappointment in Obama's policies. The American people have shown that they do not want to see Democrats either in the White House or on Capitol Hill,"" one of Russia's leading political strategists said. ""The Americans were ready to accept Obama's tax increases. At the same time, many people had to cut their living standards. Yet, no one wants to give the money to the lazy instead of the poor,"" the analyst believes. According to Konstantin Kostin, ""Trump will defend US interests, while reducing the budget spending on the export of democracy."" ""Let's wait for the formation of the Trump administration. It is hard for me to understand the Russian MPs, who applauded to the news about Trump's election. Trump is the US President, and he will act in the interests of his country first and foremost,"" the analyst said. Donald Trump's victory is not a perfect occasion for applause on Russia's part, yet, Russia has two reasons for restrained optimism, Mr. Kostin believes. Print version Font Size ""First off, US-Russian relations have always been better and more predictable during the times of Republican presidents. Secondly, Trump, as an adherent of realpolitik, will certainly be against the USA's mission of the global hegemon, exporter of democracy and color revolutions,"" he explained. ""Trump is most unusual and anti-system candidate in modern US history. The support that Trump has received means that most Americans are a lot more interested in their own income, taxes and safety than in the rights of sexual minorities, migrants and issues associated with color revolutions. ""Trump has taken a complete advantage of this in his campaign. His winning recipe contains such ingredients as bright and extraordinary style in conjunction with absolutely conservative rhetoric,"" Konstantin Kostin said. Politonline",0
23332,"US launches cyber attack on Russia’s power grid, telco networks and Kremlin command systems","US launches cyber attack on Russia’s power grid, telco networks and Kremlin command systems November 5, 2016 Google + Russia expects Washington to provide an explanation after a report claimed that Pentagon cyber-offensive specialists have hacked into Russia’s power grids, telecommunications networks, and the Kremlin’s command systems for a possible sabotage. 
“ If no official reaction from the American administration follows, it would mean state cyberterrorism exists in the US. If the threats of the attack, which were published by the US media, are carried out, Moscow would be justified in charging Washington ,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said, according to the ministry’s website . 
NBC News said earlier in an exclusive report that US military hackers have penetrated crucial infrastructure in Russia, “ making them vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons should the US deem it necessary. ” 
The report was based on the account of a senior US intelligence official and top-secret documents. NBC said the hack was carried out in preparation for waging a full-scale cyberwar with Russia. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also commented on the report, saying Russia had “ cybersecurity measures taken at the level proper for the current situation, and the threats voiced against us by officials of other nations .” 
US officials earlier alleged that countries like Russia and China could use hackers to disrupt American power grids and other crucial infrastructure. 
Moreover, US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s allegations that Moscow engaged in hacking to damage her bid for the White house have become a major issue in the ongoing US election campaign. Though she provided no proof, the Democrat candidate accused the Kremlin of hacking into the Democrats’ computer networks and publishing sensitive information in order to swing the election in favor of her GOP rival, Donald Trump. In particular, she claimed that Russia had supplied the whistleblower website WikiLeaks with emails hacked from the account of her campaign chair, John Podesta. 
Russia has repeatedly denied the accusations, asserting that it has no interest in influencing the election and questioning whether such publications would even have a major impact on how Americans would vote. No hard evidence of the alleged Russian hack has ever been made public, despite media reports claiming that US intelligence communities are “convinced” of the Kremlin’s guilt. 
So far, the only country with a record of conducting cyber-attacks on other nations is the US itself. An operation called ‘Olympic Games,’ which was reportedly conducted by the US in corroboration with Israel, involved infecting the computer networks of Iranian uranium enrichment facilities with a computer virus that affected industrial controllers of centrifuges in order to destroy them. 
The operation is said to have significantly damaged Iran’s production of nuclear fuel at the Natanz site. Washington apparently decided to go public about it after the virus, dubbed Stuxnet by the IT community, escaped and was identified by major cybersecurity companies.",0
23334,"Gary Miliefsky on Ransomware Attack: Cybercrime a Trillion-Dollar Industry, ‘Only Going to Get Worse’","SnoopWall, Inc. CEO Gary Miliefsky joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about the massive ransomware attack that swept the world over the weekend. [Miliefsky said the details of the story sounded like something from a movie script: “This group called the ‘Shadow Brokers’ got ahold of NSA   eavesdropping worm code, malware that worms its way across vulnerabilities in Windows, and somebody merged it with ransomware and created the world’s first ransom worm. ”  “The software doesn’t just affect you if you click a link. You may click the link and get infected then have to pay the ransom. But it also worms its way across your Intranet looking for more computers with same vulnerability,” he elaborated. Marlow asked if the outbreak of this malevolent software was under control after the chaotic events of the weekend. “A lot of people worldwide have gotten concerned about it, but you’re not going to believe the numbers. Over the weekend, we thought it was slowing down. It started out, it hit about 100, 000 computers by Sunday. By the end of the day yesterday, it was about 179, 000. Today, sadly, the numbers are more than double. We’re at 367, 589 infected,” Miliefsky replied. “Most of them are offline. That means they’ve been unplugged from the Internet so that people can decide: ‘Do I wipe the drive and reinstall, or am I going to pay the fee? But I don’t want it to propagate to other computers.’ But there’s still about 426 computers online that continue to propagate the worm,” he added. Milifesky said his company’s technology, which he unsuccessfully tried to sell to the “big guys” in the computer industry, is focused on protecting “small to   enterprises where all the GDP really comes from. ” “And guess what? All of our customers in the SME [Small and   Enterprise] space can not get infected with this worm. We can block it in milliseconds,” he said. “I’ve had technology to do this for years, but I can’t sell it to the big guys. It’s called NetShield. ” He explained that NetShield is a corporate product that was the first software to “go on the offensive” against malware.  “For consumers, I have some great advice today,” he said. “I put a consumer advisory out, and you can just Google it, ‘SnoopWall consumer advisory.’ In the advisory, I have links to the current stats of the worm infection, what countries are getting infected in real time. But I also have a link to Microsoft’s TechNet page where they didn’t really want to tell everyone right away, two months ago they had the fix. So I have the link to the fix for every version of Windows in that advisory. ” Marlow asked about   reports that a North Korean hacking group appeared to be behind the ransomware attack. “I’ve been told by someone who’s connected to someone in Anonymous that there’s actually, believe it or not, a kind of Russian cyber arms dealer who sells weaponized malware, somewhere in Russia, and also hacks videogames, and that person may have sold it to North Korea,” Miliefsky said. “I don’t know much more, I’m told that on hearsay, but I’m passing that on to the authorities and I know they’re going to research it. ” Miliefsky said this was a “watershed moment in cybercrime history. ” “I have to tell you, drug crime in 2015 was bigger than any other form of crime worldwide. By 2016, cybercrime surpassed drug crime and reached $600 billion. This year, I’m predicting cybercrime will be a   industry. It is not going to go away. It is only going to get worse,” he warned.

23341,New York City Has 5 Babies Born With Zika-Related Brain Issue - The New York Times,"At least four babies have been born in New York City with   brain developmental symptoms since July, the city’s health department said on Wednesday, bringing the total number of such births to five. The numbers were announced in an alert the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene sent to doctors, urging them to remain vigilant and to continue to warn pregnant women and sexually active women of reproductive age not using a reliable form of birth control against traveling to places where the virus is spreading. It was a reminder that while the threat of the virus may have eased in many places around the world, it still poses a danger and its consequences are likely to be felt for some time. Zika is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes but can also be passed on through sex. In most cases, the virus causes only mild illness, but the danger to women pregnant or trying to become pregnant is much greater, because of the impact the disease can have on fetal development. A small percentage of women with the virus have given birth to infants with a abnormally small heads and stunted brain growth  —   a condition known as microcephaly. As of Friday, about 8, 000 New Yorkers have been tested for Zika and 962 have tested positive, including 325 pregnant women, according to the health department. All the cases were associated with travel six involved sexual transmission by a partner who had been to the areas hit hardest by the Zika epidemic. In addition to the five babies with brain developmental symptoms, eight other infants have tested positive for Zika virus in New York City but have not shown evidence of what is being called congenital Zika virus syndrome. Though much of the early focus of public health officials centered on children born with microcephaly, there is concern that the virus could cause a host of other developmental problems, including brain and eye abnormalities, shortened or hardened muscles and tendons, and neurological impairment. “Today’s news is a reminder that Zika continues to be a threat to pregnant women and their babies,” said the city’s health commissioner, Dr. Mary T. Bassett. “We are closely following all babies born to mothers who test positive for Zika infection and will connect parents to available services to improve their child’s quality of life,” she added.",0
23342,Anna Dewdney Dies Author of ‘Llama Llama’ Books Was 50 - The New York Times,"Anna Dewdney, whose “Llama Llama”   picture books amused and comforted millions of preschool children, died on Saturday at her home in Lower Bartonsville, Vt. She was 50. The cause was brain cancer, her sister the anthropologist T. M. Luhrmann said. Ms. Dewdney, whom the children’  journal The Horn Book once called a “rock star to preschoolers,” introduced her most famous character in “Llama Llama Red Pajama. ” Published in 2005, it told the rhyming story of a   llama upset when his mother delays bringing a nighttime glass of water. Mama eventually turns up and the crisis is averted. Baby llama learns that Mama will always be nearby. Parents and children loved the book. “Dewdney gives a wonderfully fresh twist to a familiar nighttime ritual,” Booklist wrote. Booksellers loved it, too. The title flew off the shelves, as did its nearly 20 successors, which sold more than 10 million copies. Netflix plans to offer an animated version of the books next year. Anna Elizabeth Luhrmann was born on Dec. 25, 1965, and grew up in Englewood, N. J. Her father, George, was a psychiatrist her mother, the former Winifred Bruce, wrote books for young readers. Anna attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. and the Putney School in Vermont before earning a bachelor’s degree in art from Wesleyan University in 1987. She was a mail carrier, a waitress and a boarding school teacher before landing the assignment to illustrate “The Peppermint Race,” by Dian Curtis Regan. Ms. Dewdney illustrated several more books before discovering her llama. She told The   of Newark in 2013 that the idea had come from car trips with her two daughters in the back seat she made animal sounds to them as they passed farms. “I would say, ‘Look, there are cows,’” she said. “And I would moo and make sheep noises and chicken noises. Our vet had a field with donkeys, and then she got a llama. And I would go ‘  . ’” Written in rhymes, each book starts with a simple life problem and proceeds to solve it, with lessons learned along the way. After writing and illustrating “Grumpy Gloria,” about a bulldog jealous of a doll, Ms. Dewdney reeled off a string of   “Llama Llama” books, including “Llama Llama and the Bully Goat. Her most recent one, published last year, is “Llama Llama Gram and Grandpa,” in which Llama forgets his toys on an overnight trip. “I think children are far more like animals than they are like adults,” Ms. Dewdney told The Horn Book in 2013. She added: “Small children are ‘unadulterated’ beings. They experience and recognize feelings in themselves and others much like animals do, without all that other stuff on top. ” Ms. Dewdney also wrote the   books “Roly Poly Pangolin,” “Nobunny’s Perfect” and “Nelly Gnu and Daddy Too. ” Ms. Dewdney’s marriage, to John Ronald Dewdney, ended in divorce. In addition to her sister Tanya Marie, she is survived by her parents another sister, Alice Laughlin her companion, Reed Duncan and two daughters, Berol and Cordelia Dewdney. She recently completed “Little Excavator,” to be published in June by Viking Children’s Books. “A good children’s book can be read by an adult to a child, and experienced genuinely by both,” Ms. Dewdney told The  . “A good children’s book is like a performance. I don’t feel my world really exists until an adult has read it to a child. ”",0

An African man has been shot and killed after he reportedly attacked and injured a police officer outside the US embassy in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. 
“The man was shot dead after a confrontation with officers guarding the embassy,” a police source said Thursday on condition of anonymity, without specifying the cause of the confrontation. 
National police spokesman, George Kinoti, said the man was killed by the police officer in self-defense. 
“It was a lone criminal who attacked a police officer,” Kinoti said, adding, “He was armed with a knife.” 
Fiona Evans, a US embassy spokeswoman, confirmed there had been a “shooting incident” outside the mission, adding that “no embassy personnel were involved,” without giving further details. 
The US embassy in Nairobi is located in a heavily-fortified compound opposite the main UN complex in Gigiri, an upmarket suburb in the city’s north. 
The police officer involved in the incident was a member of the paramilitary General Services Unit deployed to guard the embassy. 
Kenyan media reported the police officer had been guarding one of the secured entrances to the embassy compound when he was assaulted. 
Kinoti described the slain man as a criminal, but refrained from giving any motive for the attack.

23347,Obamacare Architect Gruber Demands “Larger Mandate Penalty”,"Bureaucrat who said “stupidity” of Americans helped get law passed doubles down 
Paul Joseph Watson Prison Planet.com October 26, 2016 
Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber – the bureaucrat who once bragged that the “stupidity” of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place – told CNN that the “fix” for Obamacare was to impose a “larger mandate penalty”. CNN’s CAROL COSTELLO: “So let’s talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?” JONATHAN GRUBER: “Look, once again, there’s no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty“… Gruber’s arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. “ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,” points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool “stupid” Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law’s “lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage” in selling it.

As the holiday season approaches, Fox News talk show host Bill O'Reiley will, as usual, warn Americans about the ""secular progressive"" war on Christmas. O'Reiley, on his program ""The O'Reiley Factor, has charged that the secular left wants to ignore traditions of America and build a more inconclusive nation where Judeo-Christian philosophy is tamped down. 
Yesterday on Fox, O' Reilly said that ""We are all aware that NORAD Tracks Santa is an annual Christmas-themed entertainment program, which has existed since 1955,[1] produced under the auspices of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Every year on Christmas Eve, ""NORAD Tracks Santa"" purports to track Santa Claus as he leaves the North Pole and delivers presents to children around the world."" 
""But The Factor has exclusively learned that there is a left-wing conspiracy to stop Norad from tracking Santa.

Since DeVos contends that charter schools and vouchers are a good idea, enacting this policy will likely bring school choice for every child and family in America.
John F. Kirtley, the vice chairman of the foundation issued a statement of congratulations for his colleague’s appointment. “We applaud [Trump] for choosing and placing his trust in Betsy DeVos to serve as the next U.S. Secretary of Education,” wrote Kirtley.
The American Federation for Children is a national advocacy organization that promotes the fact that family choice for the education of children, kindergarten through grade 12, is essential. They support Education Savings Accounts (ESAs), which is a voucher program that allows parents to choose whatever school they deem best for their children, particularly private and home schools. They further advocate the need for school choice and scholarship tax credit programs.

This election has been exhausting for all of us, but can you imagine how Alec Baldwin must feel, having to portray a man like Donald Trump every week? I truly hope he gets an Emmy out of this — it might be the only thing that could make all of this seem worth it to him. And Kate McKinnon deserves one too. The two of them are perhaps the best match-up in the history of SNL’s political satire. 
Saturday’s cold open on SNL began much like they have since Alec Baldwin took on the role of Donald Trump. He and Kate McKinnon, who portrays Hillary Clinton, appeared on Erin Burnett’s (played by Cecily Strong) show Out Front to speak one last time before the election this Tuesday. 
After trading their usual scripted insults, Baldwin had clearly had enough and stopped. 
“I’m sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling this stuff at you like this.” 
Kate agrees, saying she finds this election all so “mean,” Then, while addressing the camera and the SNL audience, Alec Baldwin says: 
“Don’t you all feel gross about all of this?” 
What happens after that is amazing. Watch the full sketch below:

Normal people can’t just make this stuff up…but who said Netanyahu is “normal?” In a story in today’s Israel National News, Netanyahu claims he was forced to abort a planned tactical nuclear attack on Iran. According to a series of sources, a newspaper in Kuwait, a news service in “Bethlehem” and the ever faithful Israel National news, it is all true. Israel’s slated 2014 nuclear attack on Iran, to be launched from Azerbaijan using nuclear weapons landed at Poti, Georgia in 2010, was averted due to threats of US reprisals against Israel. Despite continual denials by Azerbaijan, Israel has maintained, not only nuclear armed F15’s in Azerbaijan but a drone base as well. 
Sources in the Ukraine indicate that combat aircraft from one of Israel’s two covert bases in Western Azerbaijan was in the vicinity of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 when it was shot down last year. 
In a story by Mark Langfan, a convoluted tale involving a discussion with Secretary of State Kerry from either 2013 or 2014, somehow intermingled with statements that may or may not have been made by Carter national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski in 2008, has hit the news prior to Netanyahu’s scheduled address to some members of the US Congress.

23362,CNN Breaking News: Trump Tells Supporters To Vote Multiple Times,"

CNN (also known as the Clinton News Network) has gone out of its way to try to rig the election for Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton this year. It hasn’t even tried to hide its bias in an attempt to destroy Republican nominee Donald Trump’s chances at becoming president.
Over the weekend, CNN tried desperately to find anything it could to distract the American people from the FBI’s announcement that it was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s use of an email server while she was secretary of state.
CNN ran a story on Sunday about a Trump rally in Colorado, only it blatantly lied about what Trump said at the rally in an attempt to smear him, Mediate reported .
The article in question originally ran with the headline “Trump, skeptical of mail-in balloting, encourages voting more than once if necessary.” Here’s a screen grab of the original.
“If you go to university center, they’ll give you a new ballot, they’ll void your old ballot, in some places they do that four or five times, so by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,” Trump said at the rally, according to CNN’s original article.
However there was more to that quote, which CNN decided not to run with.
“If you go to university center, they’ll give you a new ballot, they’ll void your old ballot. They’ll give you a new ballot, and you can go out and make sure it get’s in. Now in some places, they do that four or five times, but we don’t do that. So by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in,” is the full quote of what Trump said.
By selectively editing the quote, CNN made it appear that Trump was encouraging voter fraud.
After publishing the original story, CNN changed the headline, and the content, to actually reflect what Trump actually said. Initially, the network did not indicate it had done so. However, a line was later added at the end of the article to indicate it had been changed.
The new headline can be seen below:

CNN also took down the tweet that had the incorrect headline.
Maybe next time CNN will think twice before publishing such blatant lies. Instead of trying to cover up Clinton’s corruption, maybe the network should just to its job and report on the news.
This is what the media is doing these days, they chop speeches, edit them, falsify them! Let this be a warning to you for any future BS that may come out from the media. No matter how much they hype it. Do NOT believe anything the media tells you!
You know what you have to do, go out and vote for Trump! Avoid electronic voting because the machines are owned by George Soros, a Clinton donor, request paper ballot because they are obligated by the law and if they refuse to give you a paper ballot, make a scene, call the cops on them.

23366,"PayPal Founder Blasts ""Corrupt Media, Intolerant Left"", Defends Trump","

Billionaire venture capitalist and PayPal founder, Peter Thiel spoke at the National Press Club today on his support for Donald Trump.
Most of the media ignored the groundbreaking presser today.
They don’t want Americans to know about this pro-Trump gay conservative from Silicon Valley.
FOX Business Network carried much of the speech live.
Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel took his pro-Trump message to the heart of the media establishment in a major speech at the National Press Club this morning.
“We’re voting for Trump because we judge the leadership of this country to have failed,” Thiel said to an audience of about 150 members of the press.
“The insiders have been getting it wrong for a long time,” he added. Establishment politicians “are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.”
During the Q&A session, the moderator inquired about “social blowback” Thiel has received for supporting Trump and dwelled heavily on Thiel’s funding of the Hulk Hogan case that brought down Gawker.
Thiel justified funding the lawsuit against a Gawker that he described as a “singular, sociopathic bully.” Defending illegal revenge porn under the guise of the First Amendment “is an insult to journalists,” he noted.
That comment aroused a scowl in the reporter sitting next to me, who walked out shortly after.
The room was full of about 150 journalists, mostly from mainstream publications. There was a row of cameras filming the event, but only two reporters appeared to be streaming it live through Periscope and Facebook Live. National Press Club Executive Director William C. McCarren treated several members of the press brusquely as they tried to enter the event.
The event highlighted the growing gulf between the establishment and the rest of the country, the mainstream press versus the independent press, and the truth of what’s seen from direct sources and how mainstream reporters often spin it.
At one point during the speech, Thiel directly pointed out the hoaxing and bias within the media. “The Advocate, a magazine which once praised me as a ‘gay innovator,’ published an article saying that as of now I am, and I quote, ‘not a gay man,’ because I don’t agree with their politics.”
When a high-profile, highly intelligent figure like Thiel supports Trump, who cares about the truth?

23367,The Difference Between Sharting & Charting | GomerBlog,"Tweet 
Why hello boys and girls! Today’s topic, we try to tell the difference between another two often-confused terms: charting and sharting. Let’s go! 
Charting refers to the process by which health care providers replace face-to-face time with face-to-chart time. If you did something, it needs to be charted . If you saw a patient, write a progress note . If you gave a patient a sandwich , write a sandwich note . 
On the other hand, sharting refers to the process by which health care providers replace their underwear and pants because they shat themselves when they thought they were just farting . Or charting for that matter. 
Charting , though painful because it consumes over 99% of the entire workday, is never embarrassing, so in that respect it’s a good thing. This is different from sharting , which is never painful but always embarrassing. Especially if wearing white pants. 
First priority when sharting is to survey the surroundings: is anyone around? If the coast is clear, the second priority is to assess the damage: tire tracks or swamp? In this respect, charting is not as stressful as sharting . 
When you’re charting , all you can think about until you finish writing notes is, “Wow, this really sucks.” When you’re sharting , all you can think about until you change clothes is, “Wow, this really smells” and “Darn it, it’s going down my leg!” Whereas charting makes one pooped, sharting is pooping. 
When someone sees you charting , they sympathize , maybe even empathize : “Gee, I hope that she finishes charting soon.” When someone sees you sharting , they laugh and point and tell others: “HAHAHAHAHA!! WHAT A LOSER!! ONLY LOSERS SHART!” It’s true: only losers shart. 
Sometimes when you’re charting you make a mistake, but it’s easy to addend or even mark in error and start a new note. Not with sharting . Sharting in and of itself is a mistake, a huge mistake, and way harder to erase the evidence of it. In fact, you need to discard your clothes immediately. But can you get to new clothing before someone spots you? For that reason, sharting is always worse than charting . 
Now, do you know the difference between… ",0
23368,В Черном море нашли обломки более 40 затонувших кораблей,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Исследователей из США, Великобритании и Болгарии интересовал вопрос о том, как резкий подъем уровня моря примерно 12 тыс. лет назад повлиял на жизнь причерноморских народов, пишет журнал National Geographic. 
С борта судна Stril Explorer, оснащенного средствами для подводной картографической съемки, они обследовали участок акватории Черного моря площадью около 2 тыс. квадратных километров, используя дистанционно управляемые аппараты с видео- и фотоаппаратурой. 
Во время этого обследования они обнаружили места 41 кораблекрушения. Собранная ими информация дала возможность получить исключительно четкие изображения погибших судов, которые очень хорошо сохранились на глубинах от 150 до 2200 метров. 
""Самая ранняя из находок относится к концу IХ века, когда большая часть этого региона находилась под контролем Византийской империи, - отмечает журнал. - Кроме того, обнаружено много судов Оттоманской империи XVI- XVIII веков, несколько судов ХIХ века. Особое внимание привлекли обломки итальянского судна, относящегося, вероятно, к ХIV веку"". 
Как отметил в этой связи руководитель экспедиции Джон Адамс из Центра морской археологии при университете Саутгемптона, торговые корабли с Апеннинского полуострова были достаточно частыми гостями в Черном море в Средние века. ""Поразительно то, что сейчас можно увидеть обломки судна - современника Марко Поло"", - добавил он. 
Большинство из обнаруженных экспедицией кораблей были торговыми и перевозили вино, зерно, металлы и лес. Все они погибли в результате штормов, а не в результате боевых действий или нападений пиратов. Как отметил журнал, в будущем году подводные археологи продолжат изучение дна Черного моря. 
Затонувшие старинные корабли на дне морей и океанов находят не так уж и часто. Но каждая такая находка - это настоящий клад, нередко - в прямом смысле. Как рассказывала Правда.Ру, в конце прошлого года у берегов Колумбии дайверы обнаружили затонувший корабл ь, в трюмах которого, как предполагают колумбийские власти, могут стоить миллиарды долларов. 
Найденный исследователями испанский галеон ""Сан-Хосе"" был потоплен англичанами в 1708 году. Считается, что на его борту находилась партия изумрудов, а также большое количество золотых и серебряных монет.

23372,Poll Released 36 Years Ago Today Had Reagan Down by 8… He Won in a Landslide,"Reporters Stunned to Learn Trump Fans Lining Up 12 Hours Before Rally Starts 
Reagan won so big that Carter even conceded the election before California was counted. The moral of the story, it ain’t over til it’s over — and it’s definitely not over yet. It wasn’t in 1980 and it isn’t today in 2016. 
The mainstream media wants Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to win, there’s no doubt about it. WikiLeaks released emails from the account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, and one of those emails even discussed the use of “oversampling” to rig the polls . Advertisement - story continues below 
Oversampling is a tactic where more of a certain group is polled — such as more Democrats than Republicans — in an effort to sway the results. 
This isn’t anything new, but the concrete evidence of it out of the horse’s mouth is huge. For the Clinton campaign to admit the use of this biased and dirty tactic in an email is something people should remember every time the media trots out a poll. 
As Ann Coulter noted in her book “ Slander ,” the liberal media has used rigged polls to sway public opinion for years. This election isn’t the first time and, sadly, it won’t be the last. 
The mainstream media is massively biased , and their polls are often rigged. Keep Reagan’s 1980 landslide win in mind over the next two weeks — and ignore the games being played by the media. Advertisement - story continues below",0

I thought I was an Orthodox Jew but he is much more Orthodox than me because every time he talks it’s all about how he could help Jews and protect Jews. And every child he has is looking for someone to marry that’s a Jew. They go to shul [synagogue] even when there’s no reason for it. He creates Jewish holidays that don’t even exist. His    is not only Jewish but he’s Orthodox. And his daughter became even more Orthodox than the husband. So, he can’t even go with them to a restaurant because as soon as they sit down they complain that it is not Kosher enough. “I think he forgot he’s a gentile altogether,” Mason said of Trump. “Pretty soon he’ll be wearing that yalmukah (kippah) every time he goes to the White House. ” The Borscht Belt legend was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM. Listen to the full audio here.  Mason was asked for his thoughts on what Trump should do during his reported upcoming visit to Israel later this month. The trip has not yet been officially announced but multiple news media reports cite anonymous Israeli and U. S. officials saying the purported trip is slated for May 22. “I would like him to declare that nobody should disturb Israel for the next thousand years,” responded Mason. “And I would like him to declare that if anybody makes one bad move against Israel that he would wipe them out in a minute and a half. ” Mason continued on Trump and Israel: He is going to be a fantastic contrast to what we went through with Obama. Obama not only resented Israel. He resented Jews in general. He is the first American president who couldn’t tolerate the thought of Israel’s existence. And every time that [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu came to the White House he wound up sitting on a chair outside of a building or in front of the grass or under a sink. [Obama] couldn’t stand the sight of [Netanyahu] and the thought of him being there. He resented any kind of progress that Israel wanted to make to accomplish anything or any effort to find peace there. If he could start his own war against Israel he would have declared war on Israel himself. He just didn’t have a chance to do it.

23378,Women Petition U.N. Leader to Seek Korean Peace Treaty - The New York Times,"More than 130 female activists from 38 countries pressed the leader of the United Nations on Tuesday to fulfill a goal he declared after assuming the job a decade ago: a permanent peace treaty to end the Korean War. In an open letter to Secretary General Ban   a former foreign minister of South Korea whose tenure will expire at the end of the year, the women implored him to “lead the process of bringing formal closure to the longest standing war before you leave your post at the United Nations. ” The letter was   by Women Cross DMZ, a group that organized a peaceful walk last year across the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, and the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, a prominent antiwar group that is more than 100 years old. Mr. Ban, rumored to be contemplating a run to be president of South Korea after he leaves the United Nations, has often expressed a wish to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Those tensions have escalated under Kim   the North Korean leader, who has conducted missile and nuclear weapons tests in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions that have left the country deeply isolated. Despite hopes that Mr. Ban, 72, might visit North Korea before he leaves the United Nations, he said recently that such a trip was highly unlikely. Mr. Ban, born during the Japanese occupation of the Korean Peninsula, was 9 years old when an armistice halted the Korean War in 1953. The armistice, not a formal peace treaty, has left the war’s principal antagonists in a technical state of war for 63 years. “This war must end,” the women’s letter to Mr. Ban stated. It reminded him of a pledge he made in a 2007 speech: “Beyond a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue with North Korea, we should aim to establish a peace mechanism through transition from armistice to a permanent peace treaty. ” Mindful of Mr. Ban’s possible presidential aspirations, the letter said he should “aim to conclude this peace process” by 2018, the 70th anniversary of the Korean Peninsula’s division into two states. Christine Ahn, the international coordinator of Women Cross DMZ, said in an email that the letter was sent on Tuesday, the last day of the annual General Assembly session in New York, “in the hopes of encouraging Mr. Ban to uphold this promise long after he leaves the U. N. ” The signers of the letter included a number of prominent women in education, the arts and activism on disarmament issues. They included the filmmaker Abigail Disney, the playwright Eve Ensler, the feminist leader Gloria Steinem and the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Leymah Gbowee.",0
23380,Trump Suffers Bizarre Memory Disorder: Says He Always Opposed Obamacare (VIDEO),"Trump Suffers Bizarre Memory Disorder: Says He Always Opposed Obamacare (VIDEO) By Karen Shiebler on October 26, 2016 
Oh, ha,ha,ha! 
That silly old Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is so, so funny! 
He doesn’t seem to remember anything. He doesn’t remember what he has done , or what he has said , or what he believed or didn’t believe in the recent past. 
Now we have another example of Trump insisting that he said what he didn’t say, that he didn’t say what he said, and that he never believed what he said he believed. 
Confused? 
Yup. We are, too. 
Mediate reports that Trump’s memory about Obamacare is very murky, too. The candidate has been hitting the stump hard claiming that he will overturn the “disaster” of Obamacare. 
In fact, Trump has been claiming to anyone who will listen that he has always been against Obama’s health care plan. To listen to him, you would think that the man had taken to the airwaves as soon as the Affordable Care Act was passed, proclaiming that it would be the end of civilization as we know it. 
Except that he didn’t. 
After it was announced the other day that insurance premiums are going to be increasing this year, Trump pumped his fists and congratulated himself with his usual fervor. He crowed to Fox News: “I think it’s a disaster, and I’ve been saying it from the time before they even voted for it. I said this is a plan can’t work, it’s going to be a disaster.” He told Rush Limbaugh that : “Obamacare is a disaster. And you remember, I called that from before it was approved. I said, ‘This can’t work, because it’s just … the plan is no good. The concept is no good.’” 
Once again, though, the truth seems to have nothing in common with Trump’s faulty memory. In reality, back when the law was passed, Trump had not yet declared for the Presidency. He went on the air with Joy Behar on the day in 2010 when the law was passed. She asked him what he thought about the Act, and he replied that he had mixed feelings. 
Trump said that he hated to think about people being unable to get health care, but he worried about the cost to businesses. Then he commented on the President, saying: “It’s a pretty tough thing, but yeah, right now, he’s certainly looking like a hero.” So. Um. Mr. Trump’s memory is pretty damn shaky if you ask me. It seems that he is either trying to desperately to revise reality in order to put himself in a better light, or he is suffering from a very serious memory disorder.

Sessions went on to add it was the intention of the Trump administration to send the message the border was not open. “[C]an you believe that we have had the lowest number of entrances at the border in 17 years? This is the direct result of Donald Trump’s strong, clear leadership. It has an impact. The most important thing for us is to send a message to the world that the border is not open. Please don’t come. You will be apprehended if you do come, and you will be deported promptly. And if you’re a criminal, you’ll be prosecuted. And if you assault our officers, we’re going to come at you with a ton of bricks. This is the kind of message we need to send. It is already being sent. It is having a dramatic effect so far. I knew strong presidential leadership unlike the   we’ve seen in the past would impact the flow, but not as much as we’ve seen already. The numbers are down 70 percent since President Obama left office. It is really a remarkable achievement. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0

A team of scientists studied several thousands of before and after images of the moons surface, with the visual data covering nearly a million square miles. What they found is that lunar cratering appears to occur at a rate more than 100 times faster than the standard impact model has predicted. Could electrical processes on the moon be responsible for the cratering?

23392,Police: Man Charged with Raping 8-Year-Old Said ’Provocative Clothing’ Suggested Consent,"A Florida man accused of raping an    girl after he lured her into his home said her “provocative clothing” signaled consent, police said. [Sydney Allan Markland, 68, was arrested Friday and charged with sexual battery on a victim under 12 years old after police conducted an investigation that lasted several months, WESH reported.  Police said the girl lived in the same neighborhood as Markland and was walking to a friend’s house in July 2016 when he asked her to help carry some fried chicken into his home. The girl told police that she helped Markland because he appeared to be injured. While she was inside the house, Markland allegedly raped the girl and told her not to tell anyone. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the girl told one of her parents, who then called police. Investigators say that Markland’s DNA matched DNA samples taken from the victim’s clothing. Detectives state that Markland told them that his actions are permissible in his culture and that the victim’s “provocative clothing” and “actions” suggested that she consented to “sexual contact,” WKMG reported. “She was wearing provocative clothing,” Markland said, according to the detectives’ report. “Her actions suggested that she was consenting to sexual contact. ” Detectives say Markland admitted to “sexually battering” the child after they ate chicken wings and prayed together. Markland is being held without bail at the Marion County Jail. Investigators say Markland may have sexually assaulted others because he knows a lot of the children in the neighborhood, and neighbors reportedly say they saw children stop by Markland’s home regularly. “Kids will go in there, and he will give them candy and stuff,” said neighbor Steve Sarju. “Not to go inside, he will stay on his porch and say ‘Have a candy. ’”",0
23393,Everyone now officially an artisan,"October 28, 2016 
Following the revelation that printers, blacksmiths, cigar pen makers and even quilt rack makers have joined bakers, butchers and cheese makers in using the term ‘artisan’, experts have ruled that absolutely anyone is free to claim to be one. The only conditions are that they have to be unemployed marketing graduates and are not funneling over a thousand tonnes a day of cement powder and cows’ vaginas into a mixer and hoping for the best. 
‘Artisan is a coffee-focused, fun-loving space that flirts with pushing design boundaries,’ said Jason McKillop, owner of the Artisan Café in Stamford Brook. ‘Our Baristas treat each cup like a fine chef does a meal, taking pride and time to ensure each coffee is flawless. We continuously adjust the grind to allow for changes in the atmosphere – yeah, yeah, all right, it’s a café but we need a reason to charge £4 for a cup of coffee, don’t we?’ 
The trend has been welcomed by easily impressed simpletons with unaccountably well-paid jobs. ‘I like to know that “Fire is at the literal heart of Artisan; handmade, rustic dishes served straight from the flames”,’ said Manchester-based bell end Thomas Lee-Enderby of his favourite new restaurant. ‘That means they are preparing and cooking the food, right? I also like the bar which “serves handcrafted cocktails alongside cherry picked beers, wines and spirits” because I can’t stand cocktails made by robots.’ 
Meanwhile, after learning that a nearby artisan chocolatier ‘metamorphoses the finest cocoa in a myriad of chocolate shapes and flavours to surprise and satisfy all cravings and occasions’, while an artisan supplier of flush-mount wedding albums has made them ‘insanely affordable for everyone and every day’, Keith Rogers from Leamington Spa has copied and pasted from some websites and declared himself to be Britain’s first artisan supplier of spare parts and accessories for photocopiers. 
‘I use parts sourced from lovingly crafted polypropylene of an unmatched quality adhering to a real artisan standard,’ Rogers said. ‘By selecting only the finest toners, dyed to a rich black hue using locally sourced carbon black from South Wales, I am delivering a copier more complex in taste and variety for a more satisfying customer experience. Will that do? Now you can resume photocopying your own arses on it.’ Oxbridge (HT Spartacus)",0
23394,Rating: Moody‘s verbessert Ausblick für Russlands Banken,"bankensektor Der russische Staat werde die Banken weiterhin stützen. Quelle:AP 
Die Ratingagentur Moody’s prognostiziert bessere Gewinnaussichten für russische Banken in diesem Jahr – trotz der Verschlechterung von Aktiva und Zunahme von Problemkrediten. 
Der russische Staat werde die Banken weiterhin stützen, wie aus zahlreichen Erklärungen der Notenbank und der Regierung des Landes hervorgehe, heißt es in der Moody’s-Mitteilung. Dies habe dazu geführt, dass die Agentur das Rating russischen Bankwesens von negativ auf stabil gehoben habe. 
„Die langsame Erholung der Wirtschaft und die makroökonomische Stabilisierung in Russland werden das Arbeitsumfeld für russische Banken tragen“, so Moody’s weiter. 
Laut Stanislaw Kleschtschew, Chef-Analyst bei VTB24, ist die Verbesserung der Finanzlage russischer Banken hauptsächlich auf die Leitzinssenkung von vergangenem September auf 10 Prozent zurückzuführen. 
Anton Strutschenewskij, Chef-Ökonom bei Sberbank CIB, bekräftigt: Die zuversichtlichere Prognose sei begründet, „weil die Rezession der Wirtschaft gestoppt ist und die Unternehmensumsätze heute höher sind als vor zwei Jahren“, sagt er. 
Auch Standard & Poor’s verbesserte ihre Aussichten für Russland: Im September dieses Jahres erhöhte die Agentur das Rating des Landes von negativ auf stabil – wegen gesunkener externer Risiken.

For many Americans, there’s little doubt that Democrats were behind shutting down Julian Assange in a desperate attempt to silence what he knows, but it’s not working. In fact, just a short while after Hillary Clinton’s henchmen cut him off from the rest of the world, it seems that Assange is about to get himself some sweet revenge – and hopefully, the presidential hopeful likes the color orange. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange (left) and Hillary Clinton (right) 
Democrats are using every dirty trick in the book, despite their recent motto being “when they go low, we’ll go high.” In fact, it certainly seems that the only people going low are Hillary Clinton and those fiercely trying to force the American people to let her into the Oval Office. 
Proving just that, it seems that Barack Obama put on the pressure , on behalf of Hillary’s best interest, leading to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange being cut off from communicating with the world. Although the Ecuadorian government severed his Internet access, claiming they didn’t want to influence an election and Democrats just shrugged off the matter, the American people could see through the line of crap we were being fed. 
Unfortunately for Hillary and everyone who has lied and deceived in her name, it looks like her campaign is about to come to a screeching halt as the WikiLeaks founder has just promised to get himself some sweet revenge . Now experiencing just how corrupt the left is, Assange claims that his “next leak will result in the arrest of Hillary Clinton.” 
Let’s just hope Hillary likes the color orange because it looks like she’s about to spend quite a few years wearing a prison jumpsuit. In all, Assange still has over 50,000 emails to release — and those are just the ones belonging to John Podesta.",0

Susan states her husband was a strong force behind the ever-changing world of journalism, and had always been committed to ethical, yet hard-hitting, journalism. She even quoted him, saying, “Good journalism is always political journalism.”

23402,"Chief Justice Roy Moore, the Reincarnation of the Spirit of Our Founders","Print 
You may remember when Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was removed from the bench in 2003 for disobeying an unlawful mandate to remove a Ten Commandments monument in the Alabama Supreme Court building. Ten years later, however, the people of Alabama overwhelmingly voted their heroic defender of liberty back to his position in 2013. This example proves that many American citizens are looking for elected officials who uphold   hold moral conviction! 
Sadly, the Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice has again been unlawfully removed from the bench at the hands of liberal activists on Alabama’s Court of the Judiciary (COJ), due to an administrative order issued by Moore that stated, “Until further decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, the existing orders of the Alabama Supreme Court that Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment or the Alabama Marriage Protection Act remain in full force and effect."" 
Chief Justice Moore remarked, “I have been targeted for my belief in marriage, a belief shared by the majority of Americans. No one can point to any illegal, unlawful or unethical aspect of my four-page Administrative Order. That order was a status report on the case. A justice should not be removed from office because of a political agenda.” 
You see God created marriage - not man, not governments. 
Consider the following analogy. You lease a home in a residential neighborhood for your personal residence. You sign a contract –your vow—and move in to enjoy that new home. Later, you decide you want to open a retail business in that home against the owner’s wishes and against your contract. No matter what kind of attorney arsenal you have, you cannot change the zoning of that residence into a business; it is not permissible in the contract, and you don’t own the home. 
In the same way, marriage belongs to God, and He has given us the benefit of it. For this reason, when you make marriage vows, you are asked to repeat them twice. The first time is a vow to God, who creates the marriage, and the second time is your vow to the other person. 
Our founders have long since passed into the annals of history. Their monuments are lifeless stone and can no longer rectify or redeem the champions of their spiritual cause of liberty. That is our job as Americans. To defend and pray for Chief Justice Roy Moore is our duty. Why? Because as Americans, we believe in the “Laws of Nature and Nature’s God” that were set in motion by our Creator to protect the Rights He has given us.

[“They arrested us and brought us into the Zawia prison. No food. No water. They beat us every day. No doctor, no medicine,” a    Nigerian girl identified as Kamis told the U. N. children’s agency, UNICEF, from an unofficial jail in Libya.  “The results of this rapid assessment demand action. We can’t have a situation where children and women disappear into a hellhole. They are sexually assaulted, abused, exploited and killed,” declared Justin Forsyth, UNICEF deputy executive director. While thousands of African citizen seeking refuge from poverty, violence, and despair make it into Europe, thousands more only make it as far as Libya, where militiamen carry out shocking forms of abuse against them. Some militia groups have established detention centers described as “hellholes” to imprison migrants caught while passing through. In a new report, UNICEF notes: The militias developed their own detention centers because they could profit from migrants who wished to pass through certain areas. Each militia typically operates its own centre, detaining migrants on the perceived grounds that they bring disease, engage in prostitution and are criminals or mercenaries.   …     When asked whether they paid anyone to help them migrate, nearly all the children surveyed indicated they had paid smugglers. Smugglers charged the women and children between US$200 and $1, 200 each for the journey, though it was unclear whether the children had made the payment themselves. According to the U. N. there are at least 34 detention centers across Libya. The Libyan government runs 24 that hold between 4, 000 and 7, 000 detainees. Meanwhile, militias are holding migrants in an unknown number of unofficial detention centers. UNICEF reports: The survey confirmed that sanitation conditions were substandard and the centers were, worryingly overcrowded, increasing the likelihood of the spread of infectious diseases.   …     The   detention centers were no more than forced labour camps, farms, warehouses and makeshift prisons run by armed groups. For the thousands of migrant women and children incarcerated, they were living hellholes where people were held for months at a time without any form of due process, in squalid, cramped conditions. Serious violations, including allegations of violence and brutality, were commonplace. The militiamen often cram as many as 20 migrant prisoners into cells not larger than two square meters.",0
23408,"How Western Media Teleported a Child 'Victim' from Homs to Aleppo (PHOTOS, VIDEO)","How Western Media Teleported a Child 'Victim' from Homs to Aleppo (PHOTOS, VIDEO) 
Western media is capable of amazing feats which defy even the laws of physics Originally appeared at Russian Spring 
The West keeps fighting its informational war on Russia blaming Russian Air Force for bloody crimes in Syrian Arab Republic. To persuade the world community of the fact that Moscow is to blame for catastrophic humanitarian situsation in Syria and not «moderate opposition» fighters turning the country into chaos world media descend into manipulating facts and publishing fakes. 
The easily expected maximum effect has photos and videos showing children suffering from war and bombardments. Western readers keep on commenting such stories and blaiming “Assad’s regime and Putin”, but haven’t the slightest idea that those stories are skillfully made up. 
«Russian Spring» has already covered a story of a girl who had been saved again and again, several times in just one month , and now we are offering a tear-squeezing vide about a girl who was teleported from Homs province to Aleppo by the Western media. 
Child, where are you from? 
On October 10 a footage showing allegedly one of the “bombardment victims» of Syrian Talbiseh in Homs province was published on YouTube channel of local informational resource talbisah. 
And then the taer-sqeeinf video started its walk of fame thriugh media and social media: it was published on AJ+ Facebook page in particular (a Qatar-based telecom giant Al Jazzera) where it was reached by over 10 mln people (as of October 24). 
Al Jazeea accompanied the video with pitiful subttles and corresponding title: «Happy Moday from Syria: this little girl is calling her dad after her house was destroyed by an airstrike». 
BBC dealt with that video shortly and ""relocated"" the girl called Aya (as she introduced herself on the video) from Talbiseh to Aleppo by including a footage called «Aleppo: Where is my dad?» aya_bbc.jpg 
Have a more attentive look on how medical staff working: even if we omit the shooting location fraud look at how strange the doctors behave. Instead of giving the first aid necessary for a kid after (alleged) bomberdment, instaed of cleaning head and face wound to minimize comtamination risk the doctors (or the actros playing doctors) keep walking around the girl wearing a troubled look not to hinder filming the vdeo. 
Quite thick and artificail-looking blood cathes our eye as well as dark-blue bruises under girl’s eyes lookking a lot like make-up. 
The whole video looks like a staged one, the authors and creators have just used a win-win tactics for their short film: a child wounded at war. 
Twitter star 
The journalists kept on using the pretty-looking mode in their propaganda. Som time later the girl was given a poster which read “Don’t bomb me again. It hurts. Aya” and made another tear-sqeezing photo which was then published by some Omar Qayson calling himself war journalists and media activist on his Twitter page . aya_twit.jpg 
It’s laughable but “media activist’s” Twiiter «has only 11 posts open to public and the first of them is a photo of a bird killed by bombardments, the three last are reposts of the aforementioned Aya’s photograph. 
Hashtags he chosen for his photo (Children of Syria and Russian kills us ) confirm the obvious fact: social media accounts like that are created by Western journalists with just one aim — to spread false photo and videos blaimimg Russia for «bloody crimes against Syrian people».",0
23410,Re: DePaul: “Unborn Lives Matter” Posters Are Veiled Bigotry,"Print 
There are times that we are guilty of doing things that are offensive and we are unaware. Not knowing the culture you offend puts you in a position to seem bigoted. But are you responsible for how others perceive your words? Are you accountable to ensure that no one is ever offended by your words and actions? Is that even possible? 
It seems that this is now what is expected of DePaul University students. They are only to express themselves in ways that others will not take offense. 
The Washington Times reports : 
The nation’s largest Catholic university told a group of pro-life students that it could not display posters reading “Unborn Lives Matter,” lest they provoke the Black Lives Matter movement. 
In a letter to the College Republicans, DePaul University president Father Dennis Holtschneider said the posters contained “bigotry” veiled “under the cover of free speech,” the Daily Wire reported. 
“By our nature, we are committed to developing arguments and exploring important issues that can be steeped in controversy and, oftentimes, emotion,” Mr. Holtschneider said in the letter. “Yet there will be times when some forms of speech challenge our grounding in Catholic and Vincentian values. When that happens, you will see us refuse to allow members of our community be subjected to bigotry that occurs under the cover of free speech.” 
So to twist the popular slogan of one group to fit another group is bigoted? Would they feel this way if the sign were different? What if the sign read, “Black Unborn Lives Matter,” would that be bigoted? 
The truth is, the university is beginning to crack down on freedom of speech and expression, if those thoughts and expressions are conservative. More mind control from the left.

The United Nations and Amnesty International have both announced that they are sending officials to investigate allegations of human rights violations at the site of the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. 
According to a UN press release expert Grand Chief Edward John was due to arrive at Standing Rock on Saturday 30th October to gather information on human rights violations RELATED CONTENT UN Panel Warns About Israel & Saudi Arabia’s Human Rights Violations 
Grand Chief Edward John has been an Indigenous expert member of the UNPFII from North America for the past six years. 
As a UN expert, he will be visiting in his official capacity to observe the continued impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) construction such as threats to water, treaty rights and sacred areas. 
He will also collect information and testimonies on the escalating levels of repression, violence and intimidation against tribal members and their supporters by state law enforcement, private security and the National Guard. Roberto Borrero representing the International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) will accompany him as a human rights observer. IITC Board member William Means of the Oglala Lakota Nation is already on site. 
Inquisitr reports: 
Amnesty International announced Friday that they were sending a delegation of human rights observers to monitor the response of law enforcement against DAPL protesters after concerns mounted about increasingly violent actions towards the peaceful protesters. “A Shameful Moment for This Country”: Report Back on Militarized Police Raid of DAPL Resistance Camp https://t.co/grje8XIA3N pic.twitter.com/mzDNDDy7tS

Police have responded to protesters in some instances with pepper spray, bean bags, and other controversial means, and used private security staff with guard dogs in one confrontation with protesters that included women and children. Amnesty International also reports that those recently arrested have reported being strip searched and forced to pay bail for minor offenses.

Amnesty International sent a letter to the Morton County Sheriff’s Department expressing concern about the degree of force used against the protesters and is calling on the Department of Justice to investigate the police practices being used against them. 
“Arrests of protesters, who call themselves water protectors, have increased in recent weeks and law enforcement has employed a more militarized response to protests and encampments near the construction site of the Dakota Access Pipeline.” The international human rights agency sent a delegation of observers to the area in August. They report that they have stayed in contact both with members of the Standing Rock community and those policing the protests since then.

23415,What Happens If Trump LOSES The Election? What This Means For America!,"What Happens If Trump LOSES The Election? What This Means For America! by IWB · October 27, 2016 
Are the elite foreshadowing the future of America?! 
It seems so. 
All throughout the month of October, mainstream media has made cryptic statements, scenarios, and outcomes regarding what America could look like if Donald Trump loses the presidential race. 
In an article from The Boston Globe, one scenario includes a potential American uprising. During the presidential debates and campaigns, Mr. Trump has alleged the election as being “rigged,” in favor of Hillary Clinton. According to a Bloomberg News poll, 56% of Trump backers believe the election will be ‘‘rigged”… even though the “election” is really a SELECTION. 
However, The Washington Times has also questioned the same thing: Will there be some type of uprising, civil unrest, or some other triggered outcome if Donald Trump were to “lose” the elections? 
It’s also very cryptic to note how former Republican Joe Walsh made this interesting Twitter statement as of October 26th, 2016: “If Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket.” 
Then there’s the “Russian threat,” which is constantly making its way into mainstream news. According to Western sources, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is an ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned Americans to “vote trump or face nuclear war” — claiming that the Republican candidate is the only person who can prevent an escalation in tensions between Moscow and Washington. He has also said that: “The only way they can get worse is if a war starts.” 
And while the American government continues to constantly blame Russia for alleged cyberthreats, cyberattacks, and election hacks — we know this is all propaganda in preparation for world war.

23422,Judge throws out felony charges against Standing Rock protesters,"Nathan Wellman | November 17, 2016 
The felony charges facing some of the Dakota Access Pipeline protesters who were arrested during last October’s raid have been dismissed by a local judge. 
The protesters – who prefer to be referred to as water protectors – clashed with police in riot gear who were under orders to clear them out of the way for the controversial pipeline. The water protectors refused, saying they owned the land according to the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 , which gave control of the land to various Native American tribes. (The treaty was quickly broken after its ratification, mostly by the U.S. government, but also by a few rogue tribe members.) 
The confrontation lasted for hours, with police deploying ear-damaging sound cannons against protesters, as well as pepper spray and rubber bullets. Protesters set a few contained fires and a few of them threw objects at police. 
After the confrontation, 147 people were arrested, with 139 of them being charged with a felony count of conspiracy to endanger by fire or explosion and two misdemeanor counts. 
For the felony charge, prosecutors claimed that some form of informal agreement was made by the accused to set fires throughout the day, putting local state officials and the natural surroundings at risk. South Central District Judge Cynthia Feland noted that the affidavit against the protesters did not name who planned this crime, nor how and when the crime was committed, or even when this agreement was made. “As far as the court can tell from the facts alleged in the affidavit, these fires were set sporadically, at different locations, by different individuals, seemingly at random,” Feland said. “The state has not alleged facts sufficient to show an explicit or implicit agreement between the 139 defendants to commit the offense charged.” While the felony charge was thrown out, protesters continue to be charged with misdemeanor counts of engaging in a riot and maintaining a public nuisance. While the ruling is a victory for the Dakota water protecters, Feland did make a point to note that “the court recognizes the extreme stress under which law enforcement officers and the prosecutors bringing these charges have been operating. This order should not be considered a criticism of their efforts or a suggestion the arrest in this matter was not appropriate.”

23426,Hoax Tweet leads to street riots,"Topics: Twitter , Pies Wednesday, 26 October 2016 
Greggs bakery shops in Ashton, Manchester, Salford and Liverpool were targeted by angry mobs yesterday, after a hoax message on Twitter, announced that the company were withdrawing pasties from their product range. 
The Greggs pastie is renowned as the staple diet of the working classes, and its devotees can been seen walking around town centres clutching its famous blue bag with the ubiquitous hot, greasy snack poking out of the top. 
Thousands of the treats are consumed daily, by the lower ends of society, who cannot afford luxury foods such as baked beans or spaghetti hoops, and fears grew that there would be mass cases of starvation as low earners and benefit claimants were priced out of the food chain completely. 
A Red Cross spokesman told us that the situation was so bad, that they were flying back 50,000 corned beef hash and 25,000 sausage and baked bean slices that were on their way to Syrian refugee camps. 
Riot police and fire fighters were deployed in the affected areas, and police told us that by late afternoon the crowds had been dispersed and order had been restored. They did however say that there was still some areas of disorder in Liverpool, but they were hoping to restore order soon, as the police helicopter had circled low over the crowd dropping thousands of job application forms, which seemed to be scattering the rioters away from the trouble spots. 
Late yesterday afternoon the chairman of Greggs, Sir Fred Battenburg, told a hastily gathered press conference that they had been the victims of a malicious hoax, and that the company had no intentions of withdrawing its best selling product. He went on to say that the company did intend to remove an item from their shops next month, namely the fruit scone, as this was not a big seller with mainstream pastie eaters. He appealed for calm in the affected areas, and assured customers that the fire damaged stores would be open for business as soon as possible. 
Last night police reported that groups of angry pensioners and housewives had gathered outside Greggs shops in the stockbroker areas of Hale, Wilmslow, Bowden and Alderly Edge. A spokesman said the protesters were angrily tapping on the shop windows with umbrellas and shoe heels, and shouting ""shame on you""""how dare you"" and ""do you know who I am"" at staff who had locked the doors in panic. 
An elderly woman, believed to be chair of the Dunham Massey Womens Guild, Lady Dorothy Schiffer-Brains, was arrested by police and later charged with 'aggressively prodding a police officer with a rolled up copy of Cheshire Life. 
Lady Schiffer-Brains is due to appear before Knutsford magistrates later today. Make dulcie gabbani's day - give this story five thumbs-up (there's no need to register , the thumbs are just down there!)",0

23428,"King Tut Was Eastern European, According To The DNA Results","posted by Eddie Scientists at Zurich-based DNA genealogy center, iGENEA, have reconstructed the DNA profile of King Tut, his father Akhenaten and grandfather Amenhotep III. Researchers discovered that King Tut belonged to a genetic profile group known as haplogroup R1b1a2. More than 50 per cent of all men in Western Europe belong to this genetic group as do up to 70 per cent of British men. But among modern-day Egyptians, less than 1 per cent of residents belong to this haplogroup, according to scientists. King Tut and Europeans share a common ancestor genetically who lived in the Caucasus region, the blue-eyed race spreading out with agricultural about 9,500 years ago. The geneticists were not sure how Tutankhamun’s paternal lineage came to Egypt from its region of origin, though it is clear that technology such as chariots and domesticated horses was introduced from a foreign source. Along with the discovery, researchers made another announcement this week: they will conduct testing to find which modern-day European is the closest living relative of King Tut. “The offer has only been publicized for three days but we have already seen a lot of interest,” Roman Scholz, lead director at the DNA genealogy center in Zurich, Switzerland.

23434,CNN Host STUNNED By What Paul Ryan Just Said About Post-Election Racist Attacks (VIDEO) – New Century Times,"Share on Facebook 
There’s no doubt about it – the election of Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States has riled up the reality television star’s hateful supporters – hate crimes have dramatically increased across the country. To add to the fear and frustration that many Americans are feeling, the Republican Party doesn’t even have the guts to admit that the divisive rhetoric it has been spewing for decades has contributed to not only Trump’s rise, but the hateful attitudes that helped him get elected. 
This denial and lack of responsibility was on full display on CNN’s State of the Union this morning, when host Jake Tapper interviewed Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. When Tapper cornered Ryan and asked him to speak to the people who are afraid of the violence and hate crimes against minorities and women that have occurred post-election, Ryan said: 
“First of all, I hate it that people feel this way. And second of all, they should not. I think people should be rest assured, America is a pluralistic inclusive country. It is, it has been and it will continue to be. So, I really think people should put their minds at ease.” 
Tapper pressed him, reminding him that this was a serious, nationwide issue. Ryan responded by shocking Tapper and Americans when he denied that the GOP had any role in it, stating that the Trump supporters that were responsible for these awful acts aren’t Republicans. 
“That’s terrible. By the way, that’s not Republicans. We are the party of Lincoln. People who espouse those views, they’re not Republicans. We don’t want them in our party even if they’re thinking about it.” 
For the record, these attackers ARE most certainly conservatives whose main goal is to Make America White Again – there is no getting around this fact. And just when you thought Ryan couldn’t be any more full of sh*t, he said: 
“And I’m confident Donald Trump feels the same way.” 
Is he serious? Ryan and many other prominent Republicans have spent the last several months condemning Trump for his racism and hateful, divisive rhetoric – and even then, they were complete cowards. These GOPers distanced themselves from his actions, but never had enough of a backbone to actually do what was right and vote against him. Their loyalty to their hateful, discriminatory party has always prevented them from doing the right thing, and thanks to them we will now have a racist misogynist leading our country. 
You can watch the interview below: 
For Republican leaders to deny responsibility in what is now happening in our country is repulsive. They created a political climate that allowed Trump to thrive, and they supported a presidential candidate who encouraged the very violence and discrimination that we are now seeing. The GOP will not be forgiven, and they should not be able to pretend they didn’t contribute to this mess.

23435,A Mysterious Noseless Bust at Tufts Gets Back Its Name: John Brown - The New York Times,"The most prominent sculptures at Tufts University, my alma mater just outside Boston, show Jumbo, the storied circus elephant permanently lodged in the college’s mythology. But a fascinating artistic discovery is shedding new light on a lesser known, but perhaps more consequential, piece of the college’s history. MEDFORD, Mass.  —   The marble sculpture was filthy, with no nose and a doodle on its eyeballs. It had been hidden away for decades. Adding insult to injury, no one here at Tufts University seemed to have any idea who the person depicted was. “Unknown Artist (Brown? )” read the inventory after the piece was moved to   storage in 1998. “Bust of a bearded man. ” And there it stayed, until last year, when an intern came across a letter written in 1950 referring to a “marble bust of John Brown,” the abolitionist whose 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry is viewed as a precursor to the Civil War, that had lost its nose “in an accident. ” Laura McDonald, the registrar of art collections, read the letter and felt a jolt of recognition. “I remember thinking to myself, ‘You know, we have a bust that has no nose,’” she said. “I wonder   …     . ” So began the rediscovery of a remarkable piece of antebellum history far from the   line: a tale of a lost piece of art, rife with missed connections, that ended with Mr. Brown getting a new nose. The story begins in 1859, when Mr. Brown was waiting to be hanged in Virginia after his failed attempt to start a slave rebellion by capturing the arsenal at Harpers Ferry. He had become a deeply polarizing figure, respected in the North and reviled in the South as he awaited his execution. Mr. Brown had gotten some financial help from George and Mary Stearns, prominent abolitionists whose estate here in Medford was a stop on the Underground Railroad. They paid a sculptor, Edward Brackett, $120 in gold coins to travel from Boston to Virginia, where he gathered measurements of Mr. Brown’s face for a marble bust. The bust was unveiled on the day the Emancipation Proclamation took effect in 1863, at a party attended by luminaries like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Louisa May Alcott, and it was reproduced in plaster and in photographs. Despite its auspicious beginnings, the bust faded into obscurity. Ownership of it passed to Tufts in 1902, and it was displayed in a library until it went into storage at some point. The sculpture actually says “John Brown” on the back  —   but it was wrapped up alongside a sculpture of Mr. Stearns and put on a storage pallet, and no one, it seems, stood the   piece of marble upright to read the inscription. A plaster copy of the bust can be found at the Athenaeum, a private library in Boston, but no one connected it to the sculpture at Tufts. When the bust was pulled out of storage, though, the plaster copy became quite useful. A   scan was made of the nose on the copy, and then of the broken part of the marble sculpture’s face, allowing conservators to create a plaster replica of what was missing. The replacement nose was then attached, with medical tape used to hold it tightly in place while the adhesive dried. A conservator, Rika Smith McNally, used a tiny paintbrush and sparkly flecks to make it look like marble. Today, the bust, nose and all, can be seen at the Tufts University Art Gallery for the first time since it went into storage decades ago. The final resting place of the original nose and how it was broken, however, remain a mystery.",0

23447,An Appetite for Action on Tax Reform,"An Appetite for Action on Tax Reform An Appetite for Action on Tax Reform By 0 33 
In a few short weeks, this election will be over, and the task of governing will fall on the winning candidate and the reshuffled Congress. At the top of the list of issues to address in the early months of 2017 should be reforming our broken tax code. 
Why should tax reform take center stage among the many issues plaguing the country? 
Because Americans desperately want to see rising inequality addressed. Concern over the issue drove the insurgent Bernie Sanders presidential campaign and is top among issues of importance to Democratic voters. 
Lest one think Sanders’ primary loss gave the green light for inaction on inequality, note that the socialist senator from Vermont is currently the most popular politician in the country. (bright strangely / Flickr) 
The growing divides between the rich and the rest of us rank consistently among the most pressing issues facing all voters, not just Bernie supporters. In short, the public’s appetite for action is high, and the next president as well as Congress would do well to listen to them. 
There are a number of drivers of inequality, but none are so obvious and so fixable as the deeply unfair tax code. 
A review of tax returns by the New York Times last year showed the top one thousandth of 1 percent — the richest of the rich — pay just 17.6 percent of their income in taxes. For context, the top tax rate in the country, intended to tax these very people, is more than double that figure, at 39.6 percent. 
Perhaps the most egregious poster child for the broken tax code is Donald J. Trump. The billionaire appears to pay zero federal income taxes . In other words, the major party presidential candidate has contributed nothing to the development of our roads and bridges, our schools and public parks, or any of the other essential public services that taxpayers make possible. 
But Trump’s far from the only offender. 
Wealthy households and their armies of lawyers and accountants are able to dodge paying their fair share through loopholes they helped put in place. The same goes for the most profitable corporations, many of which have also dropped their federal income tax rate to zero . Plenty of these corporations are exploiting offshore tax shelters to avoid paying over $700 billion in taxes. 
It’s now commonplace for these elites to spend millions to save billions on tax reform. Meanwhile, working and middle class families, who don’t have millions to spend on lobbyists or “creative” accountants, are left to fill the hole. 
The solutions to fix the tax code and thus make a dent in reversing inequality are straightforward. 
Close the expensive loopholes and offshore tax havens that only exist to encourage tax evasion. Update the tax code to ensure those who make their money via investments or inheritance pay taxes on their income the same way people who punch a time clock do. 
Of course, the simplicity of a solution doesn’t imply it’ll be easy. Powerful forces aligned to create the unfair tax code we have now, and they’ll go to great lengths defending it. An equally powerful movement will be required to overcome this, on par with the social movements required for all the major steps forward our country has taken in its history. 
The conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist famously said, “You win the tax issue, you win all the issues.” On this point, he was right.",0

It is all part of an “anti-truancy” initiative called Operation Round Up, in which residents of Jackson County, Florida, are urged to be on the lookout for children not in school and to report them to school officials or to police. 
A truancy report can lead to a home check by sheriff’s deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents, TV station WJHG reported.

What started as a simple act of kindness has since exploded into a movement that some students rely on at a college in Alabama. Justin Franks, a 20-year-old student at Alabama A&M University, first noticed that some students in his dorm building were going to bed hungry. 
“They didn’t have any food,” Franks told ABC News. “The cafeteria here closes pretty early, and a lot of students here don’t have the money to go outside of campus to eat. I wanted to cater to those students.” 
Franks spent $40 of his own money to build up a stock of instant noodles, Capri Suns, and a few household items, such as tissues and bottled waters. He planned to share his stash with those few in need, and decided to share the news of his small stash on Facebook. His post reached over 600 shares, and word spread like wildfire. 
“I didn’t think it would get shared that much, but people really cared about our students and Alabama A&M University,” Franks told WHNT News 19. Credit: Fox 5 
Soon after, donations for the food and basics pantry started rolling in to help fund Franks’ small operation. He has since moved the pantry to an old mail room in his dorm’s building. It’s open from 6pm to 11pm, just after the cafeteria closes and into the evening in case late-night studiers need a pick-me-up. 
The pantry also includes bigger basic items, such as toilet paper, deodorant, and toothpaste, along with the dozens of non-perishable food items. It’s run just like a regular pantry, where students can come in twice a week and take up to three items. Franks is even training someone else to take over so that the pantry can continue long after he graduates. Credit: Justin Franks 
The full-time student who works three part-time jobs takes this job seriously as well, and has already helped over 100 students. He told ABC News, 
“‘Service Is Sovereignty’ is our school’s motto and I want to live up to that. I’m hoping that we can keep expanding the pantry and that it’ll continue for years to come.” 
It might be a small gesture but it’s helping these students in this small way that can help them get through one of the most challenging years of their life.

23457,"Obamacare architect: ‘The law is working as designed,’ just needs ‘a larger mandate penalty’","Print 
On Wednesday’s broadcast of “CNN Newsroom,” MIT Economics Professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber argued that “The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty.” 
Gruber said, “Obamacare’s not imploding. The main goal of Obamacare was two-fold. One was to cover the uninsured, of which we’ve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in american history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurors could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare.” 
When asked about the 22% Obamacare premium increases, Gruber stated, “the 22% increase, let’s remember who that applies to. That applies to a very small fraction of people, who have to buy insurance without the subsidies that are available.”…",0

23460,Russia hands US its behind - Response to John Kirby 17.11.2016 [Video],"
November 20th, 2016 - Fort Russ News - 
Various - Translated by  Inessa Sinchougova 




While US State Department dodging questions into its allegations is nothing new, the spokesperson John Kirby has recently gone the extra mile. Kirby stated that he would not be treating RT as an equal media organisation, to the likes of western mainstream media. Referring to the fact that Russia Today is ""state sponsored"" media, this apparently obliterates his responsibility to provide evidence into allegations of ""Russian bombing of hospitals in Syria.""  
Part of RT funding does come from the government, however this is publicly listed information and not a secret as is often ""exposed"". Who would you rather listen to - state media that is indeed supported by the government that you elected, or corporate interests of the 1%? Furthermore, the Russian Ministry of Defence provides weekly briefings of its own, so Kirby's suggestion to ""ask your own government"" only highlights his seeming obliviousness to pretty much everything. 
Kirby conveniently ""doesn't know"" that ""respectable"" CNN or BBC journalists actively distort the truth to the outlets, while working in Russia. I thought Jennifer Psaaki would be hard to beat, but then this guy happened.... 
Maria Zakharova holds the equivalent position in Russia as John Kirby does in the US and I think it is fair to say she takes the cake.

This is who we are as Americans  —   we take pride in leaving each new generation a better country than the one we inherited. Yet for decades, Washington has refused to make the tough choices. As a result, the American Dream has slipped from the grasp of more and more of our people. This has to change. We need a government that spends on the right things  —   the safety, security, and   of our people  —   and stops the waste and abuse of taxpayer funds, whether in America or in global projects overseas  —   of which, perhaps, there are too many. My administration is laying a new foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American Greatness. The budget we are proposing will reverse economic stagnation and open the path to millions of new jobs for American workers. We will balance the budget without making cuts in Social Security and Medicare. We will achieve our goals by doing exactly what you do in your home: setting priorities, cutting the fat, and growing new opportunities. And the big thing for me is economic growth, which is not possible without safety and security. We will grow our economy it is growing already. It will grow faster than you’ve seen it in decades. That is why our budget reverses years of cuts to our military that have made us less safe in a more dangerous world. We are going to make sure the men and women on the front lines of freedom have the tools they need to keep us safe and totally secure. At home, we are going to give our ICE officers  —   who have done an incredible job  —   and our Border Patrol agents  —   who are amazing people  —   everything they need to end the lawlessness once and for all. It is our moral duty to keep our citizens safe and free, and to protect the right of every American to pursue their dreams. We don’t want   roving our streets, we’re getting rid of them by the thousands, they’re going to be out of here. But I’m proud to tell you that the first budget we are releasing provides a firm new foundation for the safety, and also for jobs and prosperity for all Americans in the years to come.

23465,Clinton on Wikileaks Emails: “Go ahead. Look at them.”,"
“Go ahead. Look at them,” said Hillary Clinton, speaking before a crowd in Cincinnati about FBI Director James Comey’s decision to re-open the investigation into her private email server while investigating the emails from former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, who is suspected of having sexually charged communications with a 15-year-old girl.
“I made a mistake. I’m not making any excuses,” said Clinton.
Attorney General Loretta Lynch has objected to Comey’s decision to notify Congress of the re-opened investigation simply because it could interfere with the election less than a week away. Lynch expressed her objection hours before Comey sent the letter, according to USA Today.
Lynch based her objection on a recommendation in DOJ policy that federal authorities should not take any action that may interfere with an election.
Maybe Clinton feels confident that Lynch will continue to block any criminal prosecution. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

The experts highlighted that China's efforts to penetrate closed cyber space and the US national security agencies is the most serious threat. It is forecasted that the Chinese special services could get access to 5.6m fingerprints, some of which 'could be used to identify undercover U.S. government agents or to create duplicates of biometric data to obtain access to classified areas'. According to estimations of the authors of this report, activity of the Chinese intelligence has increased significantly for the last 15 years and is conducted through various services, including the Ministry of State Security, the People's Liberation Army, and other military organizations.

23475,Lake: ’Permanent State’ Destroyed Mike Flynn ’from the Cloak of Anonymity’ - Breitbart,"Eli Lake writes in Bloomberg View that the leaks leading to the resignation of National Security Advisor Mike Flynn are an alarming, weaponized use of “tightly held government secrets. ” He likens the intelligence community’s actions to that of a police state. [From Bloomberg:  The point here is that for a White House that has such a casual and opportunistic relationship with the truth, it’s strange that Flynn’s “lie” to Pence would get him fired. It doesn’t add up. It’s not even clear that Flynn lied. He says in his resignation letter that he did not deliberately leave out elements of his conversations with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak when he recounted them to Vice President Mike Pence. The New York Times and Washington Post reported that the transcript of the phone call reviewed over the weekend by the White House could be read different ways. One White House official with knowledge of the conversations told me that the Russian ambassador raised the sanctions to Flynn and that Flynn responded that the Trump team would be taking office in a few weeks and would review Russia policy and sanctions. That’s neither illegal nor improper.   …     There is another component to this story as well  —   as Trump himself just tweeted. It’s very rare that reporters are ever told about   communications of U. S. citizens, let alone senior U. S. officials. The last story like this to hit Washington was in 2009 when Jeff Stein, then of CQ, reported on intercepted phone calls between a senior Aipac lobbyist and Jane Harman, who at the time was a Democratic member of Congress. Normally intercepts of U. S. officials and citizens are some of the most tightly held government secrets. This is for good reason. Selectively disclosing details of private conversations monitored by the FBI or NSA gives the permanent state the power to destroy reputations from the cloak of anonymity. This is what police states do. Read the rest of the article here.",0

The Politico/Morning Consult Poll finds that 41 percent of voters think widespread voter fraud could cause the GOP nominee to lose the election. Amid Trump's increased warnings about a ""rigged election,"" 73 percent of Republicans think the election could be stolen from him, compared to 17 percent of Democrats. 
Over the past week, Trump has cast doubt on the American electoral system, saying he believes the results will be ""rigged"" at many polling places. 
""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary — but also at many polling places — SAD,"" Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday. 
Trump has also encouraged supporters to keep an eye on voting locations to prevent fraud, which some say is a ploy to intimidate voters. 
Trump is trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls following sexual assault and harassment allegations from multiple women. 
The Politico/Morning Consult poll showed Clinton leading Trump by 5 points, 46 to 41 percent. 
In a RealClearPolitics polling average, Clinton leads Trump by 5.5 points, 47.7 to 42.2 percent. 
While Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and even Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, have tried to reassure the electorate about the reliability of the election system, the poll released Monday found 60 percent of Americans think it is necessary to question the accuracy of the election results.

23477,Russia Tests Stealth Hypersonic Nuke Capable of Wiping Texas or France,"
Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS-18 ballistic missile on Tuesday. The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead, which would be able to defeat US anti-missile systems.
According to previous reports this nuke is also going to be made STEALTH and impossible to be detected by any current radar systems and it will carry a payload capable of wiping off areas as big as France or US’s Texas state with a single missile.
The test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny, Orenburg region, in the southern Urals, and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in Russia’s Far East.
“The test was a success. The warhead was delivered to Kura field,” the Defense Ministry reported.
Popular defense blog MilitaryRussia.ru says the launch was meant to test Russia’s hypersonic glider warhead, currently known by its developer designation, ‘object 4202’, or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead.
A select few countries are currently developing the technology. The US has the HTV-2, a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt. The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DF-ZF, with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014. India is also studying hypersonic flight technology, but unlike Russia, the US and China, it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warhead.
A hypersonic glider vehicle (HGV) is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space. It gives an HGV-tipped missile greater range and may give anti-missile systems a shorter window to respond to an attack.
More importantly, an HGV can maneuver during the approach to a target at high speed, making interception significantly harder, because it makes guiding an interceptor missile towards the attacking vehicle challenging and potentially impossible with current rocket technology.
Object 4202 is reportedly meant to be used with Russia’s next-gen heavy strategic missile the RS-28 Sarmat. Military experts estimate that the new ICBM, an image of which was first made public this week, may carry up to three HGVs as payload.
A previous possible test of object 4202 was reported in April.

23482,Elijah Magnier On Fake News And Fake Analysts,"November 23, 2016 Elijah Magnier On Fake News And Fake Analysts 
While I am still knocked out somewhat by a nasty influenza let me recommend Elijah Magnier's most recent piece on the ""fake news"" and ""fake analyst"" media: 
Syria and Iraq caught between the “new analysts’ and the politicised media 
Some excerpts: The wars in Syria and Iraq celebrated the unfortunate end of the “free and independent press” and the rise of the “neo-analysts”. They sit in far-off lands, with no ground knowledge of the war, collecting information and analysing the colourful bin of social networking sites. 
They have even the temerity to believe they can dictate to the US administration what measures should be taken, who to support and, as if they had mastered the “art of war”, they even push for a nuclear war with Russia. 
On Syria: According to the US State Department and to the western press, over 90 hospitals were totally destroyed in eastern Aleppo in the last months at the rate of almost one destroyed hospital per day. And every day we hear “the last hospital has been totally destroyed”. The only problem with this figure is the statistic released by the Syrian Ministry of Health stating that “on the entire Syrian territory, there are only 88 hospitals”. ... [W]hen jihadists and rebels start a large scale attack against Syrian Army forces and their allies, the media stand by, waiting for results. If the regime begins a military operation hospitals are destroyed and civilians are killed in the first hour of the battle. Rarely do militants die in mainstream media. 
On Iraq: “Neo-analysts” and journalists focus also on the role of the “Popular Mobilisation Units” (PMU) by giving them different titles, like the “Shiite crowd”, “sectarian crowd” and “Militia crowd” as if its members came from another world. There are more than 60% of Shiites in Iraq and the rest are Sunnis, secular Kurds, Assyrians, Shabak, Sabea and other minorities. From these same Iraqis are formed the Iraqi army units, counter-terrorism, intelligence, special forces, federal police forces, tribes, and Peshmergan as well as the PMU, which has become an integral part of the security apparatus under the leadership of the Commander in Chief of the Iraqi Armed Forces, the Prime Minister. 
Those writing about Iraq disregard the fact that the US Army, before and during its invasion to Iraq, committed the most abominable atrocities in that country, starting with the embargo on Iraq to massacres, torture, rape and human rights abuses during the occupation of the country. 
On the media: The notion of a “free unbiased press” is finished and has been replaced by the will of politicians: investigate journalism was replaced by information or disinformation from social media. 
It was obvious during the US presidential campaign that the “free press” was sharing “statistics” confirming the absence of any prospect of success of Donald Trump with Hillary Clinton as a winner by 98 to 99%. This indicates that the press was following wishful thinking rather than confirming data and facts, just as they have been doing most of the time with the war in Syria and Iraq. 
Elijah has been working as a newspaper journalist for some 30 years. He was war correspondent in the Yugoslavia wars, in Lebanon, in Iraq during the U.S. invasion and in Syria. The above is based on factual knowledge and experience, not on political agendas or paid ""analyst"" propaganda. One hopes that younger journalists will learn from it.   23, 2016 at 01:47 PM | Permalink",0
23485,This Could Be The FUNNIEST Anti-Trump Campaign Ad You’ll Ever See (VIDEO),"This Could Be The FUNNIEST Anti-Trump Campaign Ad You’ll Ever See (VIDEO) By Paddy Maclachlan on October 27, 2016 Subscribe 
The famously thin-skinned Republican candidate Donald Trump will be feeling even more sensitive if he sees this hilarious ad that pokes fun at him. It takes its rightful place among the very wittiest political campaign ads. 
Produced in Denmark for the country’s Socialist People’s Party ( SF ), the bus-side ad is aimed at American expats, urging them to vote in the upcoming election. It’s fairly obvious who they want those people to vote for. 
Like most of the best ads, it’s as clever as it is simple. 
It shows Trump’s unforgettably distinctive quiff and forehead but, just below it, a pair of big, googly eyes have been attached to the wheels. As the bus moves, Donald’s eyes roll. 
Talking to a local broadcaster, the SF leader Pia Olsen said : “It is meant to be a bit funny. One can’t be in doubt that it was done tongue in cheek. We want to tell American citizens: Remember to vote, it has consequences.” 
As the election draws near, both parties can be expected to increase their efforts to attract votes from the large number of U.S. citizens abroad, which amount to as many as 8.7 million. 
Turnout among this sector is traditionally low, but it has also been proven that their input can be absolutely crucial. 
Al Gore would have won the 2000 election by 202 votes, if the 2,490 overseas ballots had been counted in time. 
Let’s hope Americans in Denmark – and everywhere else overseas – see the serious side as well as the funny side, and make sure to get their vote in. 
Talking of clever ads, here’s one for Audi , which was deliberately planned to air during the Trump-Clinton presidential debates. It’s beautifully shot and directed, but it’s the line at the very end that makes it especially relevant.

Minutes before singer Sevyn Streeter was supposed to perform the national anthem at the Philadelphia 76ers game Wednesday night, she was told by the organization there was a change of plans. 
Streeter took to social media to express her frustration behind the 76ers' decision to cancel her performance, which was prompted by the statement on her clothing: 
“I'm at the 76ers game singing the National Anthem and the organization is telling me I can't because I'm wearing a 'We Matter' jersey.” Was suppose to sing the anthem at @sixers & @okcthunder game but mins b4 @sixers said I couldn't because I was wearing a ""We Matter"" jersey pic.twitter.com/wjoJN3rq0r — Sevyn (@sevyn) October 27, 2016 
In an interview with the Associated Press , Streeter said she was never told there was a certain wardrobe to adhere to: 
“I'd say two minutes before we were about to walk out...the organization told me that I could not wear my shirt while singing the national anthem at their game. I was never given any kind of dress code. I was never asked beforehand to show my wardrobe.” 
The 76ers issued the following statement , essentially saying that they understand the fact Streeter can wear her “Black Lives Matter”-related jersey, just not in their house: 
“The Philadelphia 76ers organization encourages meaningful actions to drive social change. We use our games to bring people together, to build trust and to strengthen our communities. As we move from symbolic gestures to action, we will continue to leverage our platform to positively impact our community.” 
Americans were quick to voice their support for the 76ers' decision: @KyleNeubeck @sevyn - People were there to watch the game, not you and your ""protest"". Just sing the song and walk off the court. — Vince Rosetta (@VinceRosetta) October 27, 2016 @sevyn @Sixers @okcthunder They made the right decision. Fans aren't interested in your invented crisis. — Phillip McGuire (@PhillipCMcGuire) October 27, 2016 @marclamonthill @sevyn Seriously what? A professional organization doesn't want to risk the person singing anthem turning it into a fiasco? 
But others felt the 76ers violated her First Amendment rights by not allowing her to perform: I don't understand what's happening to the First Amendment. @allanjohnson14 @sevyn @Sixers @okcthunder — Nancy Sinatra (@NancySinatra) October 27, 2016 @MTTHWBRK @sevyn @Sixers @okcthunder So she can't wear what she wants? That's a right we have in this country isn't it or is that against the law ???? — Honestly, Truly (@_RavenCamille) October 27, 2016 
And demanded answers: so... @Sixers wont let @sevyn perform the national anthem because she has a ""We Matter"" shirt on? ???? answers are needed ???? — Nellium (@_cornbread_) October 27, 2016 
76ers dancer Jemila Worley ended up singing the national anthem instead and, apparently, did an outstanding job. 76ers guard Gerald Henderson told ESPN he was a bit confused when he first saw her step on the court, but Worley “killed it.” 
Henderson added his two cents about the singer switch up, too: 
“There's a lot going on man. People care about these things that are happening, as well as they should. And they are going to express themselves in different ways...People are trying to make statements, I guess.”

23498,James Cameron Slams Trump’s Administration: ‘These People Are Insane’,"Film director and climate change activist James Cameron says President Donald Trump has filled his cabinet with crazy people. [“[Trump] nominated a guy to run the EPA [Scott Pruitt] who has eight lawsuits against the EPA, and refuses to recuse himself from those lawsuits! It’s basically the   world right now, and the kind of dialogue coming out of these guys sounds like George Orwell,” Cameron told The Daily Beast.  “Alternate facts? There’s no such thing as an alternate fact! These people are insane,” Cameron said. Cameron said President Trump is going to undo all the work that was done to help avoid a   disaster that could put the planet in peril. “Years ago, we sort of spotted the iceberg ahead of us and we called out the order to turn, and we’ve been slowly, slowly, slowly trying to turn this   ship to not hit the iceberg, and then Trump grabbed the tiller and just plunged it right back at the center of the iceberg,” Cameron said. He added: So am I worried? Of course. I’m like anyone of good conscience and reasonable intelligence. I think we’re the biggest freakin’ idiot civilization in history right now, and they’ll probably be talking about us 4, 000 years from now scratching their heads —  like they talk about Atlantis. “Who are those guys? What did they do to piss off the gods so much that they’re buried under a hundred feet of mud right now?” The Titanic director says he has “been in the writing cave for the last two years,” working on scripts for the sequels to his 2009 global blockbuster Avatar. But it’s not as if the “ ” believer put aside his political activism entirely during the last couple years. Indeed, for example, Cameron debuted a documentary warning of the dangers of climate change at the Democratic National Convention in July. The   video, which featured dramatic music, extreme weather, and natural disasters, championed Hillary Clinton as the only presidential candidate capable of saving the planet from mankind. A few months later, Cameron was among the   filmmakers behind an   video that aired in swing states on behalf of a   super PAC just weeks before Election Day. Now, following President Trump’s first week in office, Cameron said he is keeping his “head down” and “doing the stuff that [he] thought [he] would be doing if Hillary was elected. ” “I’m making my Avatar films, I’m doing my climate work, I’m doing my sustainable agriculture work. You can only do what you can do,” he said. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson.",0
23499,Stolen ’Work Will Set You Free’ Gate Returned to Dachau,"DACHAU (GERMANY) (AFP)  —   An iron gate with the infamous slogan “Arbeit macht frei” (“Work will set you free”) stolen from the former Nazi concentration camp of Dachau in Germany two years ago, was returned to the site Wednesday. [The theft of the   ( ) gate was reported in November 2014, sparking uproar, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel calling the crime “appalling”.  It was recovered outside Bergen in southwestern Norway last December following an anonymous  . At a ceremony marking the return of the gate, the president of the International Dachau Committee,   Thomas, urged investigators to press on with the probe into the theft. He said he was “deeply shocked by the desecration of the site dedicated to the memory of all the victims of the camp, and to the respect for the 41, 000 detainees who died” there. He said the theft had aimed to “remove a trace, a symbol of all that is represented by the inscription ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ on this gate of Dachau camp that some 210, 000 detainees walked through from 1933 to 1945,” he said. The gate was taken on a Saturday night between the rounds of security guards watching the site. Police at the time said they were investigating whether   had committed the crime and offered a   ($11, 000) reward for information that could solve the case. No arrests have been made so far. The Dachau camp near Munich opened in 1933, less than two months after Adolf Hitler became chancellor. More than 200, 000 political prisoners, Jews and others were incarcerated there by the Nazis and 41, 000 died before US troops liberated it on April 29, 1945. Today some 800, 000 visitors from around the world visit the camp each year. Last Sunday, US Vice President Mike Pence paid a sombre visit to the camp along with his wife and daughter. Another sign with the same inscription at the former Nazi death camp of Auschwitz was stolen in 2009. The mastermind of that theft, Swedish   Anders Hoegstroem, was caught and jailed for two and a half years. The metal sign was eventually recovered, cut up into three pieces. A replica was displayed above the entrance until the original was restored in 2011.",0
23501,Maryland Lawmakers Want More Minorities to Sell Medicinal Pot - Breitbart,"The Maryland House of Delegates passed legislation on Tuesday that would allow the state to issue five more licenses above what current law allows for growing and processing medicinal marijuana, specifically designed to make pot providers more diverse. [“The bill, which was passed on a   vote, is aimed at boosting   business participation in the state’s developing industry after a disparity study,” the Associated Press reported. “The vote sends the measure to the Senate, which is considering a separate bill. ”  Del. Cheryl Glenn, a Democrat, chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and sponsor of the House bill, was critical of a state commission’s picking finalists for 30 licenses  —   15 for growing and 15 for processing  —   last year that “lack minority ownership. ” “Passing this bill will show the country that this is not an issue that we’re going lock African Americans and other minorities from participating in this business venture,” Glenn said on the House floor before the vote. “Less than one percent of the licenses held in the entire country are held by African Americans and other minorities. ” AP noted that no final decisions have been made on any licenses and that the state commission also has named finalists for 102 marijuana dispensaries. Maryland lawmakers passed legislation to allow medical marijuana production in 2013, but limited it to academic medical centers and none came forward, according to AP. Earlier this year the cannabis industry research and lobbying group, Washington   New Frontier Data, used data from the Barack Obama Labor Department to claim legal medicinal and recreational pot would create 300, 000 jobs over the next three years. The NFD report said the industry’s biggest growth would come from legalized adult recreational marijuana use in states like New York, Illinois, and Maryland.",0
23502,National Geographic Film Crew Accused of Baiting Sharks in Southern California - Breitbart,"Maritime authorities intervened to stop a National Geographic crew from baiting sharks off the coast of Long Beach in the midst of a local panic about great white sharks appearing near the shore, according to a local news report. [The Orange County Register reported Wednesday that “officials suspect that some media outlets aren’t satisfied with footage of naturally occurring shark sightings. ” It elaborated:  Long Beach lifeguard officials say they strongly suspect film crews are throwing fish or bait in the water near shore to attract sharks, also known as “chumming. ” “We’ve gotten some reports from citizens who have seen recreational boats out chumming,” Gonzalo Medina, Marine Safety chief, said. “Some fishing boats too. They’re trying to get video footage of the sharks. Some film crews are reportedly chumming within 100 yards of the shore. One official told the Register that authorities had stopped a National Geographic film crew: “We had a crew from National Geographic.   …     We talked with them, and they were very receptive. Ultimately, they used rubber fish attached to a line that they could pull back in. ” The crew was not issued a citation, the Register reports. In late April, a woman was attacked and severely injured by a great white shark while swimming at San Onofre State Beach in Orange County. Since then, great white sharks have been spotted near the shore in Orange County and in Long Beach. Though it is not rare to see juvenile great whites in Southern California waters, it is unusual to see mature sharks, especially near the shore. The news reports have frightened many swimmers and surfers as the summer season begins. Now, it seems, media companies may be chumming the waters to create the very news they hope to report. Joel B.

In response, a statement released by the country’s Maritime Safety Administration indicates that Beijing will conduct military drills near the Paracels throughout the day on Thursday, according to the Japan Times . 
The US and its Pacific allies have objected to the construction of the islands, claiming it’s an attempt by Beijing to establish an air defense zone. China has denied these allegations and maintains that it has the right to build within its own territory and that the islands will use primarily for humanitarian purposes.

23517,BUSTED: Trump’s Campaign Chief Behind FBI’s Review Of Clinton Foundation,"It’s becoming more and more clear that not only do we have to contend with electoral interference from foreign government, but from within as well. FBI Director James Comey’s decision to reignite the controversy witch-hunt directed at Hillary Clinton and her private email server was an appalling show of partisan scheming by the FBI, and it’s becoming clear that the entire agency is working to undermine the Democratic nominee in clear violation of the Hatch Act. 
The New York Times has revealed that the FBI’s investigation of the Clinton Foundation was based on the rantings of a wingnut conspiracy theorist who wrote the an anti-Clinton propaganda tract. 
“…had not developed much evidence and was based mostly on information that had surfaced in news stories and the book ‘Clinton Cash,’ according to several law enforcement officials briefed on the case.” 
Clinton Cash, written by Peter Schweizer, has been best described as : 
“a trainwreck of sloppy research and shoddy reporting that contains over twenty errors, fabrications, and distortions. Schweizer pushes conspiracies “based on little evidence” that are “inconsistent with the facts” and “false”; takes quotes “badly out of context”; excludes exculpatory information that undermines his claims; and falls for a fake press release.” 
Schweizer rubs shoulders with other prominent wingnuts like Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck, another cog in the conservative agitation-propaganda machine. 
He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, an agitprop think tank run by – wait for it – ex-Breitbart CEO and current Trump campaign chair Steve Bannon. 
This morning, it was revealed that Donald Trump donated $1 million dollars to a Marine Corps veterans association run by the ex-assistant FBI director James Kallstrom. 
This afternoon, an FBI official spoke to the Guardian and said Clinton is “the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,” and that “the reason why they’re leaking is they’re pro-Trump.” It is clear that there are a great many forces at work behind the scenes trying to destroy the United States as we know it – and Trump is the one with the nerve to claim “rigged election!” Related Items:",0

In an audio message a written letter of appreciation to the Times Group, Dr. Singh wrote that he has never enjoyed a television debate this much. “May you be seized of the matter that I thoroughly enjoy the absolutely soothing, calming silence of the new Newshour. Until last week, when I wanted to sleep at night, I used to re-watch my own speeches earlier on the economy etc but for the past few days, every night at 9 pm, I turn the channel on and thanks to the pin-drop silence and sheer pointlessness of it all, I manage to doze off in not more than 10 minutes.

Even the most angry, irascible people in our course cool down and sleep like smiling babies on watching the program.

23522,Sad Hillary Clinton Finally Concedes To Trump Publicly,"Hillary Clinton publicly conceded the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump Wednesday after a surprise defeat overnight. Her concession speech was largely well received, even by her critics. 
Via Yournewswire 

She did not lash out or challenge the result. Excerpts of her concession speech Wednesday in New York. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I’m sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.
I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love and about building an America that’s hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted.
We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America, and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.
Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power, and we don’t just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things: the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too, and we must defend them.
And let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation not just every four years, but all the time. So let’s do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear: making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top; protecting our country and protecting our planet; and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams….
Now, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.
And to all the little girls who are watching this: Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.

23523,Collusion Between Facebook and Hillary’s Campaign Revealed in Clinton Emails,"Posted on October 29, 2016 by Michael DePinto 
Who would have thought right? Hillary’s campaign establishing what appears to be some very close ties with the largest social media company ( Facebook ) on the Internet, right in the midst of her presidential campaign? It’s not enough that Hillary has Google hiding various stories from Clinton search queries, but it looks like she had to go and get Facebook on board to help her cheat as well. But should Trump supporters take any issue with that? 
Sure, there’s been issues in the past with Facebook banning conservatives for merely looking at their monitors the wrong way, but all that changed this week right? If you recall, earlier this week we learned that despite donating huge amounts of money to Hillary’s campaign, allegedly Mark Zuckerberg betrayed Hillary Clinton, and actually jumped on board the Trump Train … or is there more to this? In the video below I dig a bit deeper into both these stories… 
Emails Show Connection Between Facebook Executive, Clinton Campaign 
… kept the interactions with Clinton private … 
A new WikiLeaks email dump shows Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg eager and willing to be involved in helping Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. 
Sandberg’s role in helping the research-driven Clinton campaign was revealed in a WikiLeaks email from Clinton aide Cheryl Mills. 
“I have arranged for Sheryl Sandberg and her researcher to be available on 5 March at 10 am to step through the research on gender and leadership by women,” Mills wrote in a February 2015 email. 
Two months after that meeting, Sandberg offered to do more for the campaign in response to an email from campaign chairman John Podesta expressing sympathy for the death of her husband. 
“I still want HRC to win badly ,” Sandberg wrote in May 2015. “I am still here to help as I can. She came over and was magical with my kids.” 
Facebook has said that Sandberg was acting in a private capacity in sharing research with the Clinton campaign. Sandberg kept the interactions with Clinton private, and did not formally, publicly endorse Clinton until early 2016. 
However, she kept in touch with the campaign. In August 2015, she emailed Podesta offering to put him in touch with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , a staunch opponent of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump . 
“Mark is meeting with people to learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action and it’s hard to imagine someone better placed or more experienced than you to help him,” she wrote. 
“He’s begun to think about whether/how he might want to shape advocacy efforts to support his philanthropic priorities and is particularly interested in meeting people who could help him understand how to move the needle on the specific public policy issues he cares most about,” she added. 
“He wants to meet folks who can inform his understanding about effective political operations to advance public policy goals on social oriented objectives (like immigration, education or basic scientific research),” she wrote. 
The WikiLeaks emails from Podesta’s account imply a meeting was arranged later that month. 
SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS ARE ACTUALLY GOVERNMENT CREATIONS: 
If you doubt that the CIA made Google, and Google made the NSA, but you don’t read the following: save your worthless drivel for someone who cares. If you don’t have the facts presented, how can you presume to dispute then? Conversely, if you dispute the facts presented with evidence stacked higher than Mt. Everest, by all means… let’s hear it, but support your opinions with FACTS, not platitudes.",0
23524,Ballot ‘Typo’ Leaves Hillary’s Name With The Word “Liar” In It,"The county is calling it an accident, but many are not convinced that it was. Credit: UK Progressive 
In what some are calling a “hilliarious” typo, Hillary Clinton’s name was misspelled to represent what many people think of her as: a liar. Though it has been waved off as an accident, the ballot spelled her name “Hilliary” Clinton and some are upset by the handling of this situation in Lonoke County, Arkansas. 
Jerry Shepard, the Republican chairman of the Lonoke County Election Commission, has said that they were not made aware of the typo until voting began. As a Republican, there would be an incentive to put in this last comical comment about Clinton’s lack of trustworthiness, but even the Democratic chairman for the county’s commission has said that there was no intention to defame her name. Credit: NBC News 
Many are not convinced, as the ballots are checked thoroughly and repeatedly for typos, misprints, and incorrect information before being sent out by mail and to polling places. The misspelling of a major presidential candidate’s name would not easily make it through unnoticed. 
Though Arkansas is largely Republican, there are still Democratic voters in the state who were upset with this alleged typo. One disgruntled voter in Lonoke County took to Facebook to express their experience with trying to report the mistake: 
“I would like to believe that they did not do this on purpose because I think it was just a spelling error. However, I did contact the clerk’s office and told them of this error and they told me that they are blowing it off because they don’t expect people in Lonoke county to vote for Hillary Clinton. 
“Whoever I spoke to they were rude and they just laughed off my complaint so I decided to call the Arkansas Secretary of State’s office. They took my complaint and forwarded me to the Arkansas Election Commission, where I filed an official complaint on the Lonoke County Clerk’s office.” 
Spelling Hillary’s name wrong does not affect citizens’ ability to vote for her, but it’s the lack of care that has people questioning whether this was really a mistake. If something similar had been done to Donald Trump’s name, his supporters would be outraged and attribute it to Clinton’s rigging of the election. 
The fact that people aren’t more upset at this typo might be evidence of her reputation as a liar in a number of situations.

23526,Report: Refusal by Mass. Police to Honor Immigration Detainers Increasing,"The instances of law enforcement officials ignoring federal immigration detainers that would keep criminal illegal immigrants in custody is on the rise in Massachusetts. [In a bombshell report by the Boston Herald, a review of the statistics reveals the increasing instances where local police in the   simply defy the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency’s detainers for illegal immigrants has vastly increased through the over the past few years.  The data, obtained from ICE by the Herald, shows the Boston ICE office, which covers all of New England, saw 59 of its requests to hold arrested immigrants denied last year. That’s up from 56 in 2015 and just 18 in 2014. Meanwhile, the denial rate of ICE detainers nationally has plummeted, from 10, 701 in 2014 and 8, 546 in 2015 to 2, 008 last year. In 2016, the Herald revealed in a report that Massachusetts had deported the least number of illegal immigrants out of every state in the US, with just 26. 9 percent of illegal immigrants being deported. Compare that percentage with the national average of illegal immigrants who are deported out of the country, 46. 4 percent. The Herald says the denial to detain illegal immigrants until ICE can take custody has partly been due to the growing number of regions in the state that call themselves ‘sanctuary cities’ and shield illegal immigrants from federal immigration law. The increase in   ICE denials coincides with the enactment of sanctuary policies in many cities that shield noncriminal immigrants from deportation, as well as state court decisions deeming that suspects cannot be held without bail just because ICE has issued a civil detainer request for them. But, not every law enforcement agency in Massachusetts is   with the   immigration trend. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said that by local authorities ignoring detainers on illegal immigrants from ICE, they are breaking the   tradition of cooperation between local and federal officials. “It would completely go against the grain of what I believe we ought to be doing,” Hodgson told the Herald. “Which is supporting one another with resources, fulfilling the request when another agency identifies that this person is of concern based on what they see. ” Hodgson has most recently said he would help build a border wall, which   Donald Trump has promised to begin building after his inauguration, using inmates from his county’s jail, as Breitbart News reported. The sanctuary city game and local authorities’ refusal to work with federal immigration agencies could soon be coming to an end with Trump’s oath of office just around the corner. Trump has repeatedly said that under his administration, sanctuary cities will be stripped of federal funding if they continue to ignore federal immigration law.

23528,Refugees scooped out of Lake Erie,"Topics: Donald Trump , Canada , Walls Monday, 14 November 2016 
Canadian border control boats rescued almost 800 US Americans yesterday seeking to escape the USA in dinghis across Lake Erie. All were wearing T-shirts declaring 'We love maple syrup' and were humming tunes by Justin Bieber and Katie Moore. They were returned to their port of departure in Vermilion, Ohio and initially catered for in a local sports hall. 
Hundreds of vessels have been spotted on the Great Lakes of Huron, Ontario, Superior and Erie since the election of Donal Trump last week. US state officials confirmed that Trump is considering building a wall along the border with Canada to keep his countrymen in. 
Applications for courses in Inuinnaqtun, the indigenous language of the Inuit, have been flooding in to adult education colleges on the USA side. Many are hoping this will enhance their chances of being accepted within Canadian territory. French is also a favorite (English too, incidentally), though President Trudeau of Canada voiced concern about developments. 
""We are a peaceful nation, but also a thoughtful one. An influx of US Americans will of course bring about a collapse in our overall IQ levels, and our average weight figures will inevitably rocket. But we intend to be a haven for all who are suffering and are heavy-laden..."" 
""Those bear-hugging, Eskimo-phobic geeks wanting to quit can go"", scowled Trump in his inimitable diplomatic tone. ""Once the wall's up....and they'll pay for it you bet they will.... they'll think twice. And I'm goona put mines in the Lakes...Now that really will be eerie....get it?.."" Make T.

23531,Donald Trump May Have Broken The Law To Avoid Paying Federal Income Taxes,"By Sean Colarossi on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 9:52 pm Trump used a “tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.” Share on Twitter Print This Post 
While Donald Trump has repeatedly said he took advantage of loopholes that allowed him to legally pay nothing in federal income taxes for decades, the New York Times reported on Monday that Trump may have actually crossed a legal boundary to avoid paying his fair share. 
According to the Times, the Republican nominee used a “tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.” 
The report: 
Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump’s tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. “Whatever loophole existed was not ‘exploited’ here, but stretched beyond any recognition,” said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s. 
Moreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other people’s money — in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City. 
The reason that Trump bent over backward – and potentially broke laws – to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to “stave off financial ruin.” 
This is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his “successful” business background. 
Yet, he calls himself the “king of debt.” His businesses have declared bankruptcy six times. He has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes. He lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business. Reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to Russia. 
All of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background. 
Even as all of this information is out there, American voters still know very little about Donald Trump’s finances because he has refused to be transparent about them. 
And consider this: What Trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting. If it weren’t, he would have already released them. 
The latest New York Times story is just the latest installment of Trump’s shady business background. The media should spend the remaining week of this campaign demanding more answers from a man who wants to be in charge of the country’s pocketbook.",0
23533,Guardian Publishes Anonymous Source Claim that Brexit Leader Farage is ’Person of Interest’ to FBI-Russia Investigation - Breitbart,"The       British newspaper the Guardian has published anonymous source claims that Brexit leader Nigel Farage is a “person of interest” in an FBI investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. [Despite stating in their fourth paragraph that the former UKIP chief Nigel Farage “has not been accused of wrongdoing and is not a suspect or a target of the U. S. investigation” authors Stephanie Kirchgaessner, Nick Hopkins, and Luke Harding composed 2000 words claiming “sources” told them about the FBI’s interest in Mr. Farage.  Not naming sources, or even who or where they work, the Guardian reports the British MEP is a “person of interest” to the FBI  —   if only because he has met several members of the President’s administration and sought to interview Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in his capacity as an LBC radio presenter. The Guardian quotes anonymous informants  —   though it is not clear if there is more than one  —   as embellishing these links to present Farage as a   figure, describing how, “If you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange and Trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage. “He’s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There’s a lot of attention being paid to him. ” Responding in a statement seen by Breitbart London, the veteran Brexit campaigner said it took him “a long time to finish reading” the article because he was “laughing so much”. “This is fake news,” he said. “This hysterical attempt to associate me with the Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and the election of President Trump. “For the record I have never been to Russia, I’ve had no business dealings with Russia in my previous life and I have appeared approximately three times on RT in the last 18 months. “I consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia. ” Farage also reiterated that his “meeting with Julian Assange was organised for me by LBC Radio with a view to conducting an interview. ” In response to the Guardian article, it has taken me a long time to finish reading because I am laughing so much at this fake news.  —   Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 1, 2017, ",0
23534,Girl Horrified At What She Watches Boyfriend Do After He Left FaceTime On,"Share This Baylee Luciani (left), Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime (right) 
The closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend, who’s attending college in Austin, was through video online chat. The couple had regular “dates” this way to bridge the 200-mile distance between them. However, the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified. 
Baylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend, Yale Gerstein, who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening. This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19-year-old girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on. 
According to KRON , Baylee was mid-conversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed, where the computer was, to see who was at his door. He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yale’s face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek. The intruders didn’t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Baylee’s face, seen in the corner, was watching everything, terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her, as she watched him fight for his life. 
Admitting that she first thought it was a joke, seconds later, she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad, who was at home with her in Dallas, into the room. “I was scared, because they were saying I’m going to blow your head off, I’m going to kill you,” Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. “I’m like wow… seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about,” she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror 
With a clear view of at least one intruder’s face, Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since, seconds later, the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yale’s music equipment. Although the boyfriend’s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them, he said that the thieves took something from him that can’t be replaced. 
“I had just finished my first album as a solo artist,” Yale said. “That’s all lost,” since they took the recordings on the equipment, which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. It’s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives, which is what happened in this case. Although it was difficult to watch, Baylee, being there through technology, was an instrumental part in protecting Yale, who hopefully learned that he better take advantage of Texas’ great gun laws and arm himself with more than just a computer.",0

23540,Obama Considers ‘Proportional’ Response to Russian Hacking in U.S. Election - The New York Times,"GREENSBORO, N. C.  —   President Obama is weighing a “proportional” response to Russia’s efforts to interfere with this fall’s election campaign through hacking, the White House announced Tuesday. “The president has talked before about the significant capabilities that the U. S. government has to both defend our systems in the United States but also carry out offensive operations in other countries,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters traveling with Mr. Obama on Air Force One to Greensboro, where he was holding a town   meeting with students and campaigning for Hillary Clinton. “There are a range of responses that are available to the president, and he will consider a response that is proportional,” Mr. Earnest said. Whatever the president opts to do would probably not be announced in advance and may never be acknowledged or disclosed if it is carried out, Mr. Earnest said. On Friday, the Obama administration publicly acknowledged for the first time that it believed that the Russian government was responsible for stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee and a range of other institutions and prominent individuals, most recently Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. The emails were posted on the   WikiLeaks site and two newer sites, DCLeaks. com and Guccifer 2. 0. “Only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities,” said a statement from the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. and the Department of Homeland Security. The statement did not name President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but that appeared to be the intention. Emails from the Democratic National Committee appeared to show party officials conspiring to sabotage the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, leading to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairwoman and the departure of several staff members from the organization. Much of the Russian efforts in the election appear directed at undermining the campaigns of Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, has called Mr. Putin a better leader than Mr. Obama and suggested a more collaborative relationship between the United States and Russia. The Russian efforts have become a talking point in the campaign. In Sunday’s debate, Mrs. Clinton called Russia’s interference in the campaign unprecedented. “And believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected,” she said. “They’re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. ” In the debate on Sept. 26, Mr. Trump said the identity of the hackers was unknown and “could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, O. K. ” On Sunday night, he again suggested that Russia might not be to blame for the email releases and said that “they blame Russia because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia. ” “I know nothing about Russia. I know  —   I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia,” Mr. Trump continued. “I don’t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. ”",0
23541,The Water in Your Glass Might Be Older Than the Sun - The New York Times," Every Friday, we’ll offer a Trilobite talking point to help you bring a bit more science to your weekend conversations. Earth is old. The sun is old. But do you know what may be even older than both? Water. It’s a mystery how the world became awash in it. But one prevailing theory says that water originated on our planet from ice specks floating in a cosmic cloud before our sun was set ablaze, more than 4. 6 billion years ago. As much as half of all the water on Earth may have come from that interstellar gas according to astrophysicists’ calculations. That means the same liquid we drink and that fills the oceans may be millions of years older than the solar system itself. The thinking goes that some of the ancient ice survived the solar system’s chaotic creation and came to Earth. To demonstrate that, researchers analyzed water molecules in oceans for indicators of their ancient past. The clue comes in the form of something known as “heavy water. ” Water, as you know, is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. But some water molecules contain hydrogen’s chunky twin, deuterium. (It contains a neutron in its nucleus, whereas regular hydrogen does not.)   water is found on other planets and moons, even here on Earth, but researchers are not sure where it came from. One idea is that much of the heavy water formed in the interstellar cloud and then traveled across the solar system. Using a computer model, the scientists showed in a 2014 paper that the     ice molecules could have survived the sun’s violent radiation blasts, and gone on to bathe a forming Earth and its cousins. They concluded that remnants of that ancient ice remain scattered across the solar system: on the moon, in comets, at Mercury’s poles, in the remains of Mars’ melts, on Jupiter’s moon Europa  —   and even in your water bottle. Now that’s something to raise your glass to. Previous Trilobite talking points: Plants will remember if you mess with them enough and yes, you are at the center of the universe.",0
23546,"‘Brexit’ Prompts Many British C.E.O.s to Consider Relocating, Survey Finds - The New York Times","LONDON  —   A majority of British chief executives are considering moving their headquarters or some of their operations outside Britain as a result of the country’s decision to leave the European Union, according to a new survey by the accounting firm KPMG.   of British chief executives surveyed said they had considered relocating part or all of their businesses following the June 23 referendum, which has come to be known as Brexit. “In our own work, we have seen international clients who had been considering basing European headquarters in the U. K. opt for Ireland instead. Our latest analysis shows that this effect could be exaggerated by U. K. companies moving,” Simon Collins, the chairman of KPMG’s British operations and a senior partner at the firm, said in a statement. “We hear it time and time again that business needs certainty,” Mr. Collins added. “Policy makers should be really concerned about a leaching of British businesses abroad and should engage with businesses early to understand what assurances they can offer and closely monitor any shifts overseas. ” To be sure, few chief executives have made concrete moves to relocate their businesses. In fact, more than   of the leaders surveyed remain confident about the future growth prospects of Britain over the next three years. But more than half of those surveyed believe that Britain’s ability to effectively conduct business will be hindered once the nation leaves the bloc. The vast majority of those surveyed voted to remain in the European Union, KPMG said. One hundred chief executives in manufacturing, retail, telecommunications and other sectors in Britain were interviewed for the KPMG survey. They all run companies with annual revenue from 100 million pounds, or about $130 million, to more than £1 billion. The new survey data came as the pound fell to a   low against the dollar and other major currencies on Friday over concerns that Britain might leave the European Union at a swifter pace than expected. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, told Sky News that Britain could start the process to leave the bloc early next year and sever its ties with the European Union in less than two years. The survey results also came against the backdrop of    economic data in Britain in recent weeks. The Bank of England held interest rates steady this month, but indicated it could further cut rates if Britain’s economic outlook weakens. In August, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0. 25 percent  —   the lowest level in its   history  —   and expanded other measures to bolster Britain’s economy over concern that the leave vote could hinder growth. According to the minutes of its most recent meeting, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee acknowledged that Britain’s economy was growing at a slightly faster pace than originally expected after the referendum and that it now expected “less of a slowing” in gross domestic product growth in the second half of the year. With that said, the committee said it still believed “the contours of the economic outlook following the E. U. referendum had not changed” and a further cut in rates to just above zero is possible if the economic outlook is “judged to be broadly consistent” with its forecast in August. The central bank is expected to provide its next round of forecasts for inflation and other economic indicators in November.",0
23548,Dakota Pipeline Protests Are Working! One Bank May Pull Funding of Pipeline Build,"Dakota Pipeline Protests Are Working! One Bank May Pull Funding of Pipeline Build 
While all eyes have been on the recent election results, protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline achieved a quiet victory. One bank may be pulling its investments in the project, leaving the Dakota Access Pipeline with very little money to continue its build. 

DNB, Norway’s largest bank, has reportedly loaned $350 million to Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) for the construction of the pipeline.The bank is worried that Indigenous rights are being overlooked by Energy Transfer Partners. 

DNB states that it will take initiative and use its position to try to find a constructive solution to the conflict. If the bank finds that these initiatives do not give appeasing answers or results, DNB will consider ending its involvement in financing the project. 

Violence by police against protesters drove the bank to review its investment in the controversial pipeline. 

As knowledge about what is going on in North Dakota reaches international countries, corporations are forced to question their own involvement in the pipeline build. 

Standing Rock Sioux Tribe members, Indigenous peoples from First Nations around the planet, activists, and even well-known reporters and move stars are all speaking out against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Protesters have occupied several camps along the Missouri River near Cannon Ball, and North Dakota. 

The protests have a history of police violence against peaceful protesters. ETP hired private security mercenaries who were untrained. These employees unleashed vicious dogs on crowds of unarmed protesters and at least 6 were mauled. 

Since then, militarized police with tanks have replaced mercenaries. Activists have been pepper-sprayed, maced, beaten, shot with bean bag projectiles and rubber bullets, tasered, blasted by LRAD and sound cannons, and have been strip-searched, detained in dog kennels, had their arms marked with numbers, and more. 

Police violence and tactics have been so bad that even representatives from the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues have been amassing testimony from witnesses and victims about excessive force, unlawful arrests, and mistreatment in jail. 

Amnesty International USA brought human rights observers to monitor the situation. 

ETP has brazenly ignored requests by President Obama and several federal officials for ETP to halt construction until a tribal lawsuit and permit reviews conclude. 

During the chaos of Election Day, ETP announced it will be moving forward with drilling to begin installation of the pipeline beneath Lake Oahe in only two weeks, hinting that it would do so with or without appropriate permits. 

DNB views these acts as unacceptable and will likely revoke its financial support if ETP continues to ignore Indigenous requests. 

If DNB withdraws its financial support, the bold move could inspire other major investors to follow suit, especially if the public continues to apply pressure.

23549,Trump controlled by Mossad,"By wmw_admin on October 30, 2016 By Timothy Fitzpatrick — The Fitzpatrick Informer Oct 29, 2016 Anno Domini Donald Trump and Mossad asset Ghislaine Maxwell out on the town in New York City in 1997. Click to enlarge Part I Any inquisitive person should be asking themself why a seemingly anti-establishment candidate like Donald Trump has been allowed to get as far as he has in the U.S. presidential race for election November 8. The simplest answer is that he isn’t anti-establishment and is only fronting a very convincing facade for public consumption. The family-made rich man has been strategically propped up as the all-accommodating GOP extremist opponent of candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, herself part of the very same establishment and even personal friend to Trump—at least prior to the race. The two candidates come from the same organized criminal syndicate that leads back to Israel, its murderous Mossad terrorist organization, and the Lansky international crime syndicate. Furthermore, as we shall see, Trump is nothing more than a puppet of Mossad and is likely under their control through opportunism and, darker yet, blackmail. What Trump and his cronies all share in common is sexual compromise and their loyalty to the international Judeo-masonic power structure. Sexual blackmail and Illuminism Jeffrey Epstein and alleged child sex procurer Ghislaine Maxwell Perhaps the most powerful form of blackmail is that which involves sexual matters, and so it is that throughout human history, many men of power have been brought down upon revelation of some sexual scandal. It was through this channel that Adam Weishaupt’s illuminism (blackmail) was so successful in his time through to today (Weishaupt stole the Catholic sacrament of confession and used for his own personal gain—so that he could gain knowledge of people’s sins in order to use it against them). Since then, it has proven to be the most useful form of blackmail employed, especially in the political world. Every person in a position of power should be suspected of being controlled through this form of blackmail, since the Judeo-masonic cryptocracy controls virtually every aspect of organized government, the press, and the financial system, to name a few. You may have heard of the bizarre sexual initiation of Yale University’s Skull and Bones secret society, where the would-be bonesman reveals his sexual secrets to his fellow initiates and initiators. [ i ] From the very start of their societal ascent, you could say, a bonesman is blackmailed and falls under control of the society. Former Israeli Mossad case officer Victor Ostrovsky revealed in his first tell-all book about the Mossad: “… there are three major “hooks” for recruiting people: money; emotion, be it revenge or ideology; and sex.” [ ii ] This scenario is played out in virtually every sphere of influence at one degree (pun intended) or another. As it happens, both presidential candidates are connected to sexual scandals, the likes of which we shall explore in Trump’s life.

[11/3/16] Music producer and singer Pharrell Williams bashed Donald Trump at an industry conference on Tuesday and said his defeat in the upcoming presidential election would be “easy” if every woman in America voted to elect Hillary Clinton. 
“If all the women in this nation decided to vote and support the first female candidate, there’d be nothing to worry about,” Williams said in an interview at Variety ‘s Inclusion summit at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills. “It’s that easy.” 
“Has she been dishonest about things? Sure. Have you?” Williams said of Clinton, before insisting that “she don’t lie no more than any other politician does.” 
The Happy singer endorsed Clinton in March 2014, telling GQ magazine: “We’re about to have a female president. Hillary’s gonna win.” 
Asked about increasing polarization during the presidential campaign, the Grammy-winner paused and then pleaded with women to “save the nation” by not electing another “destructive” male president. 
“That silence in this room right now is often what I feel when you see some of the things that are being said, not just about my culture, but about women,” Williams said . “I’m praying that women come together and save this nation. You think about the destructive things that have come from mankind, it’s mostly men.” Post navigation",0
23553,Правозащитные организации игнорируют существование Мьянмы | Новое восточное обозрение,"Регион: Юго-Восточная Азия В своей новой статье постоянный обозреватель НВО Тони Карталучи отмечает, что обласканный Вашингтоном диктатор Мьянмы Аун Сан Су Чжи заняла пост «главного советника» страны, которую контролируемая ею партия придумала для того, чтобы обойти существующую в стране конституцию. По факту, Су Чжи стала единовластным правителем страны, несмотря на тот факт, что никто её на этот пост не избирал. Автор отмечает, что Канада признала Аун Сан Су Чжи в качестве «де-факто лидера страны», назвав главный закон Мьянмы, запрещающий самопровозглашённому диктатору занять пост президента, «странным правилом». При этом в Мьянме участились судебные разбирательства над оппозиционными журналистами, которые посмели выразить свое недовольство действиями «главного советника» в Facebook. Такие прозападные правозащитные организации, как Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch и Reporters Without Borders просто-напросто игнорируют все, что происходит в Мьянме, поскольку интерес Вашингтона к демократии и правам человека пропадает сразу же после того, как посаженное им на власть правительство открывает рынки того или иного суверенного государства для разграбления западными корпорациями.

India has decided to add some more strength in its Russian made military helicopters Mi-17V5. 
“Ministry of Defence intends to procure and install approximately 200 sets of Electronic Warfare Suite comprising Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) and Counter Measure Dispensing System (CMDS) on Mi-17V5 helicopters,” reads a request for information issued by the Indian government. 
The system will provide self-protection to the helicopter against radar controlled weapons and IR seeking missiles by employing different counter measures such as chaffs, flares and directed infra-red. The Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) is intended to provide the capability of detecting, identifying warning and prioritizing air to air and ground to air threat missiles to the pilot. Fifteen Mi-17V5 helicopters would also be integrated with Laser Warning Receiver (LWR) and Directed Infrared Counter Measures.

India also wants to secure its helicopters against radar controlled weapons and IR seeking missiles. For this Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) has design and developed the Counter Measure Dispensing System that will be integrated on to the platform. 
India plans to buy additional helicopters from Russia out of which more than a dozen will be made available to the BSF. India had already approved the purchase of 48 more Mi-17V-5 medium lift helicopters. Delivery of 151 Mi-17V-5 helicopters was made in February this year.

23557,Trump fans rally in Jerusalem,"Print On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel’s best friend if elected. Wearing “Make America Great Again” baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn’t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. “Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that’s what I like,” David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. “He’s not a saint, but look at his achievements.

23558,Silver Signals The Flight To Real Safety Is On Again – Fund Manager,"Tweet Home » Silver » Silver News » Silver Signals The Flight To Real Safety Is On Again – Fund Manager 
The movement back into non-fiat assets is starting again – anything connected to debt, like housing, is a de facto fiat asset. The best indicator of this is not gold, but silver: 

From PM Fund Manager Dave Kranzler : 
Gold is powering higher because the dollar is dropping. The dollar index is down 1.7% in the last 3 1/2 trading sessions. It’s down 2.3% vs the euro in the last 5 1/2 days, down 2.1% vs the yen in the last 3 days and down nearly 2% vs. the Swissie since Sunday night. 
This is NOT about the political chaos connected to the U.S. election. That’s a sideshow distraction to the real problems going on behind the scene. 
The U.S. economy is starting to collapse. This is becoming glaringly evident from most of the data, notwithstanding the highly manipulated economic reports like auto sales. 
The movement back into non-fiat assets is starting again – anything connected to debt, like housing, is a de facto fiat asset. The best indicator of this is not gold, but silver. Silver was correlating with SPX for most of October, when the investment “thesis” was “a strengthening economy is good for industrial metals.” 
The graph below illustrates this. It shows silver’s movement vs. the SPX for the last 3 months: 
Silver correlated almost perfectly with the movement of the SPX for most of October (shaded area on the graph). But silver has moved up while the SPX has been selling off (including today, Nov 2nd) the past 4 trading sessions. This signals a switch from silver performing as an “industrial” metal to silver functioning as a “monetary” metal. 
Certainly based on the gold-silver ratio, silver is extraordinarily cheap to gold and thus represents a prototypical “value” trade as the markets begin to accept and reflect economic reality and reject the politically-charge propaganda about a “healthy” economy coming from the Fed, the White House and the Democratic candidates.

There was a little bridge over a muddy area on a trail by the Cuyahoga river, and for some reason my girlfriend and I decided to take the muddy path instead of the bridge. Well, she slipped and fell, so I helped her up and we made our way back to the bridge to go across the sane way, when we saw a sleeve stapled to the outside of the wooden handrail with a DVD in it labeled simply with ""infowars.com Jesse Ventura 9/11"", and I grabbed it because... well, why not? Popped it in at her house and watched it, it was an episode or two from Jesse Ventura's show Conspiracy Theory, one about FEMA camps, one about 9/11, and then some reletively short clip of Alex Jones yelling at me, and ending with an audio clip of some guy preaching about the end times coming soon and needing to get right with Jesus or something. I dunno, I didn't listen much to him because I don't care a thing for religion. Anyhow, that's at least what opened my mind, so to speak, to this world of conspiracy.

Sessions III (R. .) to the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday told Breitbart News he was thrilled to stand by his friend. The senator watched as   Donald J. Trump’s attorney general nominee handled himself with poise and intelligence during the day’s confirmation hearing. [“It was a great honor,” said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R. .) who was joined by Sen. Susan Collins (R. ) for the ceremonial introduction to a committee of which Sessions is actually a sitting member.  “I believe Senator Sessions’ nomination by   Trump was very wise,” he said. “Sessions brings integrity and purpose to this job. He has been on the committee for 20 years, he’s been the attorney general for the state of Alabama, he’s been a U. S. Attorney —  he’s a conservative with a lot of purpose and that’s important. ” Shelby said it was difficult to watch Senate Democrats breach the comity that governs personal relationships in the Senate by attacking Sessions as a racist, a liar and someone who would not enforce laws he disagrees with. “I believe he’s going to be confirmed, but some Democrats were grilling him too much —  being not real nice to him,” he said. “But, they are playing raw liberal politics,” he said. “I understand what they’re doing. They’ve got all these people they’re bringing   are Democratic constituents to work the hard left against a good nominee. ” “But, they didn’t lay a glove on him,” Shelby said. “They know down deep —  most of them —  that he is qualified for the job and he will do a good job,” the senator said. “He’s got character above everything and they need that above everything at the Justice Department. ”",0
23564,’New York Post’ Sports Reporter Sues Paper After Fired for Anti-Trump Tweets - Breitbart,"A sports reporter fired by the New York Post is now suing the paper for firing him without cause, a report says. [Sports writer Bart Hubbuch reported on his Twitter account that the paper fired him for his   tweets. Hubbuch complained in his announcement that he posted his tweets on his own time.  An important status update: pic. twitter.   —   Bart Hubbuch (@BartHubbuch) January 31, 2017,  The writer referred to a series of tweets in which he called the election of Donald Trump a “national tragedy,” and compared the election to the terror attacks on   and the Japanese attack on U. S. forces at Pearl Harbor causing the U. S. to enter WWII. At the time, the Post explained that Hubbuch engaged in “unprofessional conduct. ” “We expect our reporters to interact with the public, including on social media, in a professional manner. Unfortunately, Mr. Hubbuch has engaged in a pattern of unprofessional conduct and exhibited serious lack of judgment, including most recently showing disrespect for the victims of Pearl Harbor and ” the paper’s statement read according to NBC Sports. Now Hubbuch insists in his filing that the Post violated New York labor laws. The fired writer’s attorney said the paper violated New York Labor Law Section   which makes it “unlawful for any employer . . . to discharge from employment . . . an individual . . . because of . . . an individual’s legal recreational activities outside work hours, off of the employer’s premises and without use of the employer’s equipment or other property,” NBC reported. Hubbuch again notes that he posted his tweets on his own time, from his private computer, and did not use company time or resources to attack Trump. The lawsuit also pointedly notes that the New York Post constantly engages in “tabloid style” sensationalism and his tweets are mild by comparison. “In keeping with its tabloid style, the Post has sensationalized the actual or perceived the fault of democratically elected leaders by running covers showing them dressed up like tyrants responsible for murder, torture and repression,” Hubbuch’s filing says. Hubbuch also claims he was told he would not be fired if he apologized for the tweets, which he did, but was fired anyway. He also charges that his employer fired him to curry favor with Donald Trump. The argument comes down to whether the paper had the right to fire him for things he did on his own time. Hubbuch demands a monetary award for damages, as well as reinstatement to his job. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
23566,Trump: McCain ‘Losing So Long He Doesn’t Know How to Win’,"President Donald Trump fought back against Sen. John McCain after the veteran senator criticized his decision to launch a military mission in Yemen. [“Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The White House deemed the mission a success, but Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens was killed. McCain, however, appeared vexed by the raid’s conclusion, describing it as a “failure” due to the loss of life in the mission and the enemy’s awareness of the attack. Trump ridiculed McCain for getting the country in numerous conflicts around the world. “He’s been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in  —   bogged down in conflict all over the place,” Trump added. Trump said that the Navy SEAL who was slain in the mission was a “hero” and reminded McCain that Secretary of Defense General James Mattis described the   mission in Yemen as a success, not a failure. “Time for the U. S. to get smart and start winning again!” Trump concluded. On Wednesday, press secretary Sean Spicer called for McCain to apologize for his statement, asserting the senator did “disservice” to the slain Navy SEAL’s sacrifice. “I think anybody who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and [does] disservice to the life of Chief Owens,” Spicer said during the White House press briefing. In response, McCain cited his military service and his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, suggesting that Spicer had little room to criticize him on matters of war.",0
23568,Clemson University Student's Welcome: 'Ben Shapiro Is A Pig' | Daily Wire,"Clemson University Student's Welcome: 'Ben Shapiro Is A Pig' By: Hank Berrien November 1, 2016 
Apparently word has been passed to leftists that Daily Wire Editor-In Chief Ben Shapiro will be speaking at Clemson University tonight. ""Ben Shapiro Is A Pig"" was chalked in a Clemson classroom this morning. Looks like the SJWs are very excited to hear @benshapiro tonight! pic.twitter.com/hkd3YgIwMn — Caleb Ecarma (@calebecarma) November 1, 2016 
There has been no explanation as to who decorated the chalkboard, nor whether the culprit wanted to issue a more eloquent denunciation of Shapiro but was hindered by the limits of his/her vocabulary, thus being restricted to words of three letters or less. 
Shapiro’s usual denunciation of political correctness is likely the reason for the gratuitous insult; in October 2015, Clemson was plagued by PC when a few students protested Clemson Dining’s ""Maximum Mexican"" night, tweeting their displeasure with such a ""#CUlturallyInsensitive"" event. Clemson senior Austin Pendergist told Campus Reform the post-event uproar was “ridiculous … This is something that Clemson Dining has done for years without any sort of backlash. People love the cultural nights in the dining halls. What's next? Are they going to take away all potato based food as to not offend students from Irish decent? Remove the stir fry station so Asian-American students don't feel as if they are being misrepresented? When does it end?” 
But the administration wound up apologizing for the event; Dr. Doug Hallenbeck, Clemson University’s Senior Associate Vice President of Student Affairs, said the event displayed a “flattened cultural view of Mexican culture … It is the mission of University Housing & Dining to create supportive and challenging environments that enrich and nourish lives. We failed to live out our mission yesterday, and we sincerely apologize,” adding that the university “will continue to work closely with [its] food service provider to create dining programs that align with Clemson University’s core values.” 
The administration also apologized on the Clemson Dining Services Facebook and Twitter pages. 
Pendergist said the event had only featured “a couple balloons, sombreros, and some tacos,” adding, “For as long as I've been here, and probably for much longer, Clemson dining has put on certain culinary theme nights, where they decorate the dining halls and serve whatever kind of food. They have Italian night, Mexican night, seafood night, midnight breakfast, all kinds of events.”

23582,Germany Moves to Ban Cultivation of GM Crops Under EU Opt-Out Law,"The Netherlands 
Poland 
Germany’s GM ban is significant considering that biotech industry representatives have been trying to keep their stranglehold on the genetically modified crop market in the country. 
The news will likely not be taken well by DuPont Pioneer and Dow Chemical, who have been waiting for an EU executive permit for GMO cultivation in Germany and other EU countries for nearly 15 years. 
Likewise, Monsanto has criticized other member states for using their ‘opt-out’ vote to ban GMOs from their countries, stating that their decisions “contradict science.” 
It was just over six years ago that another EU country, Hungary, strongly enforced their GM ban by destroying 1,000 acres of GM maize that had been found growing illegally. The Hungarians were the very first to take a forceful position in the European Union in relation to the use of transgenic seeds. 
Germany’s GMO ban is doubly important due to the planned merger between the Germany-based Bayer, and U.S.-based Monsanto. With ChemChina-Syngenta and DuPont-Dow Chemical forming their own multi-billion-dollar mergers, consumers and farmers still have a way to refuse genetically modified crops as they are increasingly incorporated into international treaties and trade agreements. 
As agricultural companies continue to consolidate , becoming larger and larger entities with greater capacity to lobby governments in their favor of monopolizing seed markets, the German opt-out sends a clear message to the makers of these seeds. They can grow bloated and powerful but in the end, the people will decide what they eat.

23585,Voter Fraud Worries Overshadow Dallas County Elections,"Two weeks before the start of early voting and less than one month from a May 6 election, allegations of forged   ballots targeting the elderly overshadow the Dallas County elections. [One Dallas pastor, James Armstrong, expressed concerns that elderly residents are being targeted in a possible   voter scheme after some of his church members said they received ballots, only they never applied for them.  “It’s just a travesty that we are dealing with this,” Armstrong told NBC DFW. “Seniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of. ” Armstrong, the senior pastor of the west Dallas Community Fellowship Church, said at least 10 church members, all senior citizen voters, filed complaints with the Dallas County Elections office after receiving these unsolicited   ballots, according to The Dallas Morning News. The pastor is not the only one to question purported irregularities.     West Dallas resident Alice Washington still votes in person but she says she got a   ballot for the May 6 election. Barbara Roberson, her niece, contacted the Dallas County Elections office, requesting to see a copy of the application. “I said, ‘Would you please send me a copy of that application because I’d like to see her signature,” Roberson told WFAA. The election’s office mailed Washington her supposed application but upon receipt she said it was not her signature. In fact, the family asserts Washington never saw or signed the documents. “Someone forged her signature,” said Roberson. Registered voters can only vote by mail in Dallas County if they personally apply for a   ballot. The elections office does not send out applications or ballots without a specific request from a voter, according to office’s website, which cites specific eligibility requirements including the applicant’s signature. Dallas County Elections administrator Toni   said her office received 36 complaints over the suspect   ballots, so far, according to WFAA.   indicated her team is working with the District Attorney’s Office to review all of the complaints and substantiating documentation so they can determine how to move forward. Dallas City Council District 6, the region allegedly in question, covers a wide area of northwest Dallas and extends to the communities surrounding Dallas Love Field Airport. In a heated District 6 race, five challengers currently seek to unseat current Mayor   Monica Alonzo in the upcoming Dallas County elections. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings backs Alonzo. Election integrity advocates have argued that absentee ballot problems can sometimes be rooted in poor maintenance of the underlying voter records. The Public Interest Legal Foundation noted in response to the Dallas episode that Texas should consider tightening procedures for requesting absentee ballots. “As long as you have a name and address of another voter, you’re good to go   …     You don’t even need to give a birth date,” a group spokesperson told Lifezette. Analysts say that requiring absentee ballot applications to include driver’s license or other   identification numbers could cut down impersonation attempts like claimed by the Washington family. Last November, emotions ran high over the national election and similar concerns over voter fraud emerged in West Dallas after 15 senior citizen voters were turned away from the polls. They were told they could not vote in person because they submitted   ballots, according to the Dallas newspaper. In late October, a state investigation kicked off over   ballot irregularities in neighboring Tarrant County. Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.",0
23586,"Saudi Warplanes Repeatedly Bomb Yemen Prison, Killing 60","Officials Say Attack In Keeping With Targeting Procedures   
Mostly destroyed and no longer usable, the prison in the Yemeni city of Hodeidah held 84 inmates until Saturday, when Saudi Arabian warplanes repeatedly bombed it, killing at least 60 of the people within and wounding dozens of others. 
The exact number of prisoners killed compared to guards is unknown, though prisoners are said to be the vast majority. The prison was leveled in the attack, according to witnesses, and rescue workers are still looking through the rubble, with others believed trapped within. 
Three airstrikes were targeted against the prison, with the first hitting it directly, bringing down the roof, and the follow-up attacks targeting the gates and the administration buildings. The Saudi coalition insisted the attacks were in keeping with targeting procedures, noting the prison was known to have Houthi security forces within. 
It is unclear who the prisoners generally were at the prison, but deliberately attacking a prison will doubtless add to concerns about Saudi Arabia’s standards for airstrikes against Yemen, which have killed massive numbers of civilians over the past 19 months.  ",0

It is simply called Repelente Gel, and it is produced by and for the Brazilian Army. A military lab makes it, so good luck getting your hands on it. The occasional civilian who has managed to find it has often ended up swearing by it. I know. I am one of them. I encountered this repellent in Haiti while on assignment for The New York Times in 2010, covering the cholera epidemic and a presidential election. Brazilian soldiers were a large part of the United Nations peacekeeping force helping to police Haiti. One afternoon, I rode along with them on a patrol. As I got on a truck, a smiling soldier handed me a tube of his repellent and in English said, “For you, for the mosquitoes. ” I was intrigued at what a soldier from an Amazonian country would use. The stuff I had always picked up at the drugstore had never seemed to be quite enough. So I slathered it on. No allergic reaction, good. Better yet, even hours later, no mosquitoes  —   at least noticeably fewer. No buzzing in my ears. No patchwork of bites. I strained to conserve this miracle gel for the remaining days of that trip and subsequent ones, despairing when it ran out. (Hey, guys, how about another  ?) I was not alone. Simon Romero, my colleague in The Times’s Rio de Janeiro bureau, swears by the stuff, too, having used it on trips with the military into the Amazon jungle. So what’s the secret? And more important, where can you get it? Well, the Brazilian Army prefers to keep its product for soldiers and is circumspect about saying exactly what makes it so effective. The main ingredient listed is diethyltoluamide, commonly known as DEET, which scientists say is among the most effective chemicals against mosquitoes. It is found in mosquito repellents available the world over, but the army’s public relations office did not answer questions about how much DEET was in it (other than to say the amount was “similar” to that found in commercially available products) or whether it contained other antimosquito ingredients. (It did say the repellent worked on “a broad spectrum of insects. ”) The office said the repellent had been developed over the course of 20 years and “was tested in the laboratory and the field by the land forces across the whole country. ” The office added, “It showed excellent results in areas of major insect pest infestation, such as Amazon, Pantanal, Angola and Haiti. ” There is no “plan for external commercialization,” the statement said. Word is getting around, though, about how good it is. The Brazilian Health Ministry wanted the gel, too. In December, the ministry asked the army for it, to give to pregnant women as part of   measures, but negotiations apparently stalled. The army had expressed concern, according to news reports, that its lab could not produce the repellent on the scale that the health ministry wanted. “The army and all the country’s laboratories which we have consulted are not prepared to produce the volume of repellent we need immediately,” the health minister, Marcelo Castro, said in January. There is some hope for Olympic visitors. To protect the Games, Brazilian officials have said, they have deployed more than 85, 000 soldiers and police officers to Rio de Janeiro. You never know what a friendly soldier might share.",0

23594,Reduce Nurse Burnout by Treating Nurses as Well as We Treat Patients,"Prev post Page 1 of 4 Next 
Nurses are among the most underappreciated professionals in the world. They care for us from the time we enter the hospital to the time we leave. They care for our loved ones during the most difficult and terrifying times of our lives. To put it simply, they save lives. 
Not only that; they save multiple lives every day. Because we are so troubled by whatever issues has brought us to the hospital, we rarely think of the nearly incomprehensible amount of stress that is put upon the person caring for us. This is understandable. When we are in the hospital, we are usually at our very worst and not in the mood to care for the troubles of others. 
Assuming the reader is not a nurse, put yourself in that position for a moment. Every day, the healthy, safety and livelihood of multiple individuals are in your hands. You may be overworked and heavily burdened, but you do not have the benefit of going on “cruise control” like many other professionals do some days. Any mistakes could cause serious consequences. Theresa Brown , a columnist for the The New York Times and registered nurse for over five years, may have said it best, “It’s not like being a waiter, where you have too many tables, which is stressful, but no one’s going to die if they don’t get their entree in time.” 
This why it is not difficult to understand how many of America’s nurses are getting burned out. In fact, a recent survey of forty different hospital units found that over one third of nurses reported that they intend to leave their position within the next year. This is a startling concept to imagine one third of the world’s nurses quitting. In the study, they cited two main reasons for this: emotional exhaustion and lack of personal accomplishment. 
One could see how they could feel emotionally exhausted, but to think that the people who dedicate their lives caring for the sick do not feel accomplished or appreciated enough? That shows that the problem may not be with the nurses, but for those around them. 
So, how do we fix this? Nurse burnout is a common problem, and there are multiple ideas and schools of thought as to how we should deal with it. However, to develop a proper solution, we must first fully understand the problem and its root causes. Although we do not profess to offer one grand solution that can solve nurse burn out, we do hope to examine the problem and hopefully provide some understanding.

23599,Calling Trump Moscow’s favorite is nonsense created by media – Putin,"Calling Trump Moscow’s favorite is nonsense created by media – Putin Calling Trump Moscow’s favorite is nonsense created by media – Putin By 0 71 
The idea that Russia has a favorite in the US election was deliberately created by the media, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, adding that Moscow is “largely unconcerned” about the outcome of the vote and is ready to work with any future president. 
“The image [that Russia supports a candidate in the US presidential election] was created by the media,” Putin said at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi on Thursday, adding that it was done deliberately and on purpose. 
Read more 
“This idea was planted into the US public consciousness… with only one goal… to protect the interests of the Democratic candidate in her competition with the candidate of the Republicans, in this case – with Mr. Trump,” the Russian president stressed. 
The US media “first portrayed Russia as an enemy and then said that Trump is our [Russia’s] favorite,” Putin said, denouncing these tactics as “absolute nonsense.” “This is complete and utter rubbish, and it is just a method of internal political struggle, as well as a way of manipulating the public consciousness ahead of the US presidential elections,” he added. 
He went on to say that Russia is not interested in a victory of any particular candidate and is ready to cooperate with any of them. “Generally speaking, we are more or less unconcerned about it,” the Russian leader said. 
At the same time, he stressed that Russia welcomes words and intentions concerning normalization of relations between the US and Russia, “whoever expresses them.” He also said that it is “hard” to work with the current US administration as it does not fulfill its obligations under any agreements, adding that Russia is ready to start working with a new US president. Trump’s extravagant behavior is thought-out political strategy 
Donald Trump “has chosen his own method to get through to voters’ hearts,” Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, adding that the Republican candidate must have a reason behind his extravagant behavior. 
Read more 
“He [Trump] just represents ordinary people and portrays himself as an ordinary guy, who criticizes those who have been in power for decades,” Putin said, adding that only voting will show if this strategy is effective. 
At the same time, Putin stressed once again that Moscow will work with every US president who is chosen by the US people and is willing to cooperate with Russia. 
Earlier, Putin also dismissed all accusations concerning Moscow’s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections, saying that the ‘Russian card’ was used during the election campaign to distract voters from the real internal problems of the US. 
He also sharply criticized the US and the EU for attempts to portray Moscow as an enemy and stressed that “Russia is not going to attack anybody.” 
Putin and Russia have often been mentioned during the US presidential race. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has not only accused Donald Trump of being actively supported by Moscow, but also claimed that WikiLeaks, which repeatedly released documents hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Convention, of working for the Kremlin.

23602,Trump Touts Marine Le Pen As ’Strongest’ Candidate in French Presidential Race,"In a new interview U. S. President Donald Trump has said that while he does not formally endorse   migration French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, she is the “strongest” on borders and security, ahead of Sunday’s first round of voting in France. [The U. S. President said that he believed the terror attack that killed one police officer and injured two others on Thursday would likely help Ms. Le Pen, who has promised to restore order in France during her campaign. Speaking to the Associated Press Friday Mr Trump said Le Pen was, “strongest on borders, and she’s the strongest on what’s been going on in France. ”  Trump tweeted in reaction to the Paris shooting: “Another terrorist attack in Paris. The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election!” Many interpreted the tweet as an implicit endorsement of the Front National leader, though Trump has had no personal contact with Le Pen or has sought to formally endorse her. The closest the two have come to meeting occurred earlier this year when Le Pen made an impromptu appearance at Trump tower in New York City before the presidential inauguration in January. Ms. Le Pen claimed that she was meeting associates in New York who had chosen the venue and had no plans or intentions of meeting with the President. Many have compared Ms. Le Pen and her campaign to that of President Trump with U. S. broadcaster CNN saying that the parallels between the French election and the U. S. presidential election last year were “scary. ” According to CNN, the polling currently shows the Front National chief closely behind front runner Emmanuel Macron, who recently promoted his telephone conversation with former U. S. President Barack Obama  —   another U. S. President involving himself in the French election without an official endorsement. Much like Trump, Marine Le Pen has vowed to combat radical Islamic terrorism and has said she will have a much tougher border policy, getting France out of the   Schengen agreement. Le Pen has also said she would look to hold a referendum on French membership of the European Union and advocates an exit or “Frexit” from the bloc. Ms. Le Pen has also praised Trump and in a speech in February said that his election and Brexit were, “in tune with the great planetary movement which consists of the awakening of the peoples [and] the return of national frontiers and national pride. ” Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart. com ",0

He stressed that people have to have enough respect to take time and get to know the man. He spoke to the people who persist in saying “Donald Trump” as a way to ignore the office that Trump won on November 8, saying, “Call him what he is —  he is the President of the United States. ” Malone added, “And I tell everyone out there that wants to protest and do all that, other countries are laughing.

23609,Chuck Schumer: ’America Cannot Afford a Twitter Presidency’,"Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) used his first speech as Senate Minority Leader to attack   Donald Trump’s use of Twitter  —   repeating a theme that Democrats and the media used often during the 2016 presidential campaign, to no real effect. [Schumer’s speech, which was hailed by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer for its toughness, laid out an opposition agenda that included holding Trump accountable for promises to change Washington. And Schumer warned Trump that Twitter would not suffice:  So, Mr. President, the issues facing this country are many. We have a lot of work to do  —   creating jobs, raising incomes, making college and health care affordable, rebuilding our infrastructure, making trade laws work for the American worker, keeping Americans safe from threats of violence and terrorism, taking care of our vets. Now, each one takes serious thought and action. These issues are too important for mere words, our challenges too entrenched for mere tweeting. Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency. We have real challenges and we have real needs to get things done. Many Americans are afraid, Mr.   that instead of rolling up your sleeves and forging serious policies, for you, Twitter suffices. There’s nothing wrong with using Twitter to speak to the American people. It’s a good use of modern media. But these issues are complex and demand both careful consideration and action. We cannot tweet them away. Later, Schumer added: “America doesn’t conduct foreign policy by Tweet. ” However, the Obama administration frequently has used Twitter to conduct foreign policy. For example, under Obama, the  State Department used a Twitter account, “Think Again Turn Away,” to counter propaganda from the   Islamic State. The Obama administration also used Twitter hashtag campaigns, such as “#UnitedforUkraine” and “#BringBackOurGirls,” to confront various foreign policy crises.

23611,Palestinian Negotiator Warns Trump: Moving Embassy Will End Peace Process - Breitbart,"TEL AVIV  —   Moving the U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would end the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat warned on Saturday. [“We believe that moving the U. S. embassy to Jerusalem would mean the end of the peace process,” said Erekat, who is also   of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) during a World Economic Forum meeting at the Dead Sea in Jordan on Saturday.  Erekat’s warning is the latest of a series of similar declarations from Arab and Muslim leaders. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is slated to meet with Trump in Bethlehem on Tuesday, said in January that if Trump moves the embassy, it will “destroy the peace process. ” Abbas’ senior aide and the PA’s supreme Sharia judge Mahmoud   stated that an embassy transfer would be a “declaration of war. ” And earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Erdogan said it would be “extremely  ” for Trump to move the embassy. Erekat said a Palestinian state without eastern Jerusalem as its capital would have “no meaning. ” He also expressed his hope that “President Trump would give us a chance. ” “He said   …     he will not impose solutions on us or on the Israelis,” Erekat said. “(But) the fact that he is going to move the embassy is imposition, is dictation. ” Erekat also met with opposition member Tzipi Livni (Zionist Union)  —   his counterpart in   negotiations  —   and the two expressed their hope that Trump would be successful in his efforts to jumpstart the moribund peace process. The new U. S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, welcomed the notion of an embassy relocation but said the decision was ultimately Trump’s. The president’s   visit to Israel will coincide with Jerusalem Day, marking the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem since the 1967 defensive war and speculation has been rife that the president will use the opportunity to announce an embassy relocation. However, on Wednesday a senior administration official told the Times of Israel that the decision “wouldn’t be immediate” and “a final decision hadn’t been made. ” Earlier in the day, a White House official told Bloomberg that considering the upcoming attempts to restart the peace talks, moving the embassy would be  . “We don’t think it would be wise to do it at this time,” he said. “We’ve been very clear what our position is and what we would like to see done, but we’re not looking to provoke anyone when everyone’s playing really nice. ” A waiver for the congressional mandate on an embassy transfer has been signed every six months by consecutive U. S. presidents since 1995. The next date for that waiver is June 1.",0
23612,Huntington Beach Goes to War Against Threat to Force District System - Breitbart,"The City of Huntington Beach, California has vowed to fight an effort by   attorney Kevin Shenkman to force it to abandon an   system of voting in favor of a district system. [Shenkman has waged a campaign against dozens of cities in Southern California for the past several years, using a law called the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) to challenge   election systems as racist. Most cities have capitulated in recent years.  The CVRA allows plaintiffs to “prove” that white voters vote as a racial bloc to exclude minority candidates simply by claiming that a minority candidate might have won but for the fact of being outvoted by the racial majority. The burden of proof is very low. In addition, the law allows successful plaintiffs to recover costs from the cities they sue, if they win  —   but cities are not allowed to recover their own legal costs from plaintiffs if they prevail in court. In 2012, the City of Palmdale, in Los Angeles County, fought Shenkman in court, and ultimately was forced to pay $4. 5 million in a settlement. That experience has been enough to scare many other municipalities away from a fight. But Huntington Beach, located in Orange County, has become the second city in recent months to fight Shankman. The other is liberal Santa Monica, which Shankman alleges has a voting system that discriminates against Latinos, even though the current mayor is Hispanic. The Orange County Register reports: “We are prepared to vigorously defend any lawsuit,” City Attorney Michael Gates wrote in a May 18 response to the letter’s claim the city’s elections were “racially polarizing, resulting in minority vote dilution. ”   …     Gates refuted the notion that the city’s elections create a “racially polarized” process. Gates noted Thursday he had received unanimous backing from the mayor and City Council in closed session and was prepared to defend the city on an array of fronts, ranging from the city’s demographic diversity to the constitutionality of the voting act as applied to Huntington Beach.   …     Beyond factual disagreements, Gates said “there are also legal arguments where we believe the (voting rights act) has vulnerabilities, and past cases have even discussed that. ” The CVRA was once declared unconstitutional by a state court, but that decision was overturned on appeal. Since then, the Supreme Court has invalidated part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on the grounds that evidence of racial discrimination must be shown in order to justify federal “preclearance” of voting changes in certain states.

The parade organizers, the Allied War Veterans Council of South Boston, voted unanimously late Friday to reverse their decision made on Tuesday to exclude the group, OutVets, which had marched in the event the past two years. OutVets had been given two reasons for being excluded  —   its application was late and the rainbow in the group’s logo, worn on jackets, was in violation of the parade’s code of conduct. But after the organizers voted 9 to 4 to exclude OutVets, council members came under increasing pressure to reconsider. Top politicians in the state, including the governor, Charlie Baker, and the mayor of Boston, Martin J. Walsh, announced they would skip the parade. The reversal came during a meeting arranged by Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, and other elected officials at the V. F. W. Post 561 in South Boston. After the meeting, members of the Allied War Veterans Council said the change was the right decision. “They volunteered like everyone else did, and they will be treated with respect and dignity at this parade,” Edward Flynn, a member of the council, told    in Boston. The organizers voted 11 to 0 to make OutVets a permanent participant and will not require the group to resubmit an application for this year’s parade. Dee Dee Edmondson, a lawyer for OutVets, said the group was stunned by the turn of events. “Everything that we wanted to have happened has happened,” she said. “It’s history in making. ” OutVets will also be the lead group in the parade, she said.",0

The inspired use of a variety of sets at differing levels and positions in the theatre in Acklam Village brings the audience right in to the heart of the drama and to the edge of their seats. The analogues nature of the occupation of Ithaka, at the heart of the play, to the story of Palestinians is clear throughout the play yet not overwrought. 
I have been a supporter of the Palestinian cause since I became politically aware in my mid-teens. This political awakening took place during the post 9-11 atmosphere in the west. As US troops draped the star spangled banner upon and tore down Saddam’s statue in Firdos Square in Baghdad, the Second Intifada raged across the Palestinian territories and Israel. As Bob Dylan once sung, we live in a political world. As I have learnt more about the history and present occupation of Palestinian land, I have always felt that the drive to free the Palestinians of their daily humiliation at the hands of the Israeli state should be led by Palestinians. 
Productions such as ‘When Nobody Returns’ provide agency to Palestinians, those Palestinians who still grind out an existence on the West Bank and Gaza and those in exile, to tell their fundamental story of loss, betrayal, despair and ultimately strength. You can see and feel this strength in the performances of the actors. Iman Aoun, who plays Penelope Odysseus’s wife, exudes the granite and dignified exterior of a war widow who refuses to be beaten by the occupier. 
If you are a supporter of Palestinian human rights and enjoy theatre of the highest quality I encourage you to plan a visit to see ‘When Nobody Returns’ and the prequel ‘This Flesh is Mine’ (drawn from Homer’s The Iliad).",0

23624,"Ethiopian Runner Won’t Return Home, but Doesn’t Know Where to Go - The New York Times","NAIROBI, Kenya  —   The Ethiopian marathoner who flashed an antigovernment gesture as he crossed the finish line in second place at the Rio Olympics will not go home. The runner, Feyisa Lilesa, will not fly back to Ethiopia on Tuesday with the rest of his team, his agent said, choosing instead to remain in Brazil with his immigration status unclear. “He didn’t plan at all for this,” said Mr. Lilesa’s agent, Federico Rosa, speaking by telephone from Brescia, Italy. ”He doesn’t want to go to Ethiopia, he wants to go to another country. The U. S. would be very good but right now we just don’t know where he’s going to go. He was very happy after winning but also a bit confused. ” By raising his arms and crossing them in an X in front of his face as he crossed the finish line Sunday, Mr. Lilesa, 26, has crossed the Ethiopian government, one of the most repressive in Africa. His gesture, which he repeated during an award ceremony on Sunday after the race, was the most visible in a growing wave of protests in recent months against Ethiopia’s government. This unusual burst of protests has erupted across Ethiopia, especially in Oromia, the region from which Mr. Lilesa hails, and where the gesture of raised arms crossed in front of one’s face has become a sign of defiance. Tens of thousands of protesters have been jailed and hundreds have been killed, according to Human Rights Watch. Mr. Lilesa said in interviews after his race that he believed that if he were to return home, he, too, would be punished. The Ethiopian government has said he has nothing to worry about and that he would be treated like a hero upon his return. Mr. Rosa said that Mr. Lilesa was a serious young man who “doesn’t like to play games. ” Some sports analysts have speculated that Mr. Lilesa, who finished the Olympic marathon in 2:09:54, and has one of the 50 fastest times in history, might chose to run for another country, such as Bahrain or Qatar. The Gulf states have wooed  many other   athletes with promises of large pay days if they win international competitions. Mr. Rosa said that Mr. Lilesa, who won the Tokyo marathon this year and has a contract with Nike, did not make his protest in an effort to cash in. “He didn’t plan at all to go to another country,” Mr. Rosa said. “I don’t know even when he decided to do this. He didn’t say anything to me about it. I was surprised. And you don’t do something like this for money. He did this to defend his country. ” In an interview with journalists Sunday in Rio after his race, Mr. Lilesa said he did not discuss his protest beforehand with his agent, coaches, teammates or his family. His wife and two children remain in Ethiopia. If Mr. Lilesa wants to apply for asylum in the United States, it would be difficult to do that while in Brazil. He might first have to get asylum in Brazil and then apply to the American authorities for   humanitarian parole. Under that program, which is used sparingly, often for people in danger, Mr. Lilesa would be allowed to travel to the United States and stay temporarily. Once on American soil, he could apply for political asylum. Mr. Lilesa has became a sensation on social media. As of Tuesday night, nearly $100, 000 had been raised for him via a crowdsourcing website. “We assure you all the money collected will go to support this   hero,” the site said.",0
23627,A Republican Senator Just Told His Fans To Put A “Bulls-Eye” On Hillary’s Face,"Comments 
North Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr was recorded not-so-subtly wishing that gun owners might shoot Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a despicable new tape that emerged on CNN. 
Burr is the Republican Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a high title which seems inappropriate for a man of such small mind as to muse of the death of an American presidential candidate in a public place during a general election. CNN reports that : 
The North Carolina Republican, locked in a tight race for reelection [against Democrat Deborah Ross], quipped that as he walked into a gun shop “nothing made me feel better” than seeing a magazine about rifles “with a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.” Sen. Richard Burr privately mused over the weekend that gun owners may want to put a “bullseye” on Hillary Clinton, according to audio obtained by CNN. 
“I was a little bit shocked at that — it didn’t have a bullseye on it,” he said Saturday to GOP volunteers, prompting laughter from the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. “But on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there’s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.” 
The comments resemble similar ones made by Donald Trump in August when the GOP nominee said “Second Amendment people” could take matters into their own hands if Clinton became president. 
Senator Burr also mentioned how proud he was to have crippled the effectiveness of the Supreme Court by delaying President Obama’s appointment of Merrick Garland which itself has set a record for longest time after such an appointment without a hearing. 
In the same talk, Burr bragged that he’d support keeping the court in a state of permanent dysfunction by refusing any of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s judicial appointments, including to the Supreme Court. 
It’s fast becoming apparent that Republicans merely used that piece of double-talk as the start of an existential attack on American-style democracy, which requires a reasonable opposition to cooperate and compromise in decisions for a functioning government for the betterment of the people. 
Double talk from Republican Congressmen of this type has become all too commonplace, but with Senator Burr’s lies to North Carolina voters, it’s so bold that he even gave opposite quotations to local reporters versus those inside the beltway and thought he could get away with it. 
Burr both publicly distanced himself from Trump and at the very same time doubled down on supporting Trump after his tapes emerged revealing the Republican nominee’s serial predilection for sex assault. 
Now that Richard Burr’s deplorable tape has emerged, the Republican Senator is facing calls to resign his position in the Senate altogether. 
Unlike Trump, the North Carolina Republican has already issued an apology, but it remains to be seen whether that will have any saving grace for the vulnerable Republican, who is locked in a death heat with Democrat challenger Deborah Ross . 
It is absolutely unacceptable that an elected member of the United States Senate would even make jokes about the political assassination of one of our nation’s most dedicated public servants",0

23633,White Suspect in Black Man’s Killing Is Indicted on Terror Charges - The New York Times,"A white Army veteran from Baltimore, who the police said traveled to New York to kill black men, was indicted on Monday on rare state charges of murder as terrorism. A grand jury voted to upgrade existing charges against James Harris Jackson, 28, who the police say confessed to plunging a sword into Timothy Caughman, 66, on March 20 in Chelsea. The killing sent shockwaves throughout New York at a time when there is widespread concern in the city and around the country over rising hate crimes. The grand jury voted to charge Mr. Jackson with murder as an act of terror in the   and   Joan   an assistant district attorney, said during a brief appearance in Criminal Court in Manhattan. Judge Tamiko A. Amaker ordered Mr. Jackson, who was also charged with   murder as a hate crime and misdemeanor weapons possession, to return to jail until his arraignment on April 13 in State Supreme Court. Mr. Jackson cocked his head back and stared at the ceiling as he stood in handcuffs and a khaki prison jumpsuit next to his defense lawyer, Sam Talkin. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison without a chance of parole. Mr. Talkin declined to comment on the grand jury charges. Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, said Mr. Jackson prowled Midtown for days in search of victims for his “campaign of terrorism. ” “Last week, with total presence of mind, he acted on his plan, randomly selecting a beloved New Yorker solely on the basis of his skin color, and stabbing him repeatedly and publicly on a Midtown street corner,” Mr. Vance said. “James Jackson wanted to kill black men, planned to kill black men, and then did kill a black man. ” The police and prosecutors say the killing stemmed from a hatred of black men “mixing” with white women. It echoed the 2015 killings of nine   churchgoers in South Carolina by an avowed white supremacist, who was sentenced to death. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo both condemned the attack on Mr. Caughman, with the mayor calling it a racist act of domestic terrorism. Mr. Caughman, an ebullient man who described himself on Twitter as a can and bottle recycler, was rummaging through the trash on 9th Avenue near the corner of 36th Street around 11:15 p. m. on March 20 when Mr. Jackson pounced on him from behind and plunged the   blade into his chest, according to the police. “What are you doing?” a woman told the police she heard Mr. Caughman say, according to a police complaint filed in court. As his assailant fled, Mr. Caughman staggered the short distance to the Midtown South police station on West 35th Street, where officers summoned an ambulance, the police said. He died at Bellevue Hospital.   hours later, Mr. Jackson walked into the police substation in Times Square and told officers to arrest him, the police said. He told investigators that he dropped the sword in a garbage can in Washington Square Park, where it was later recovered. Carl Nimmons, 66, and his wife, Portia Clark, 64, both longtime friends of Mr. Caughman, sat   at the hearing on Monday. Mr. Nimmons, who said he had known Mr. Caughman for more than 55 years, fought tears describing what it was like to see Mr. Jackson in court. “It hurt to see that man like that, doing that to someone I grew up with,” he said. “I didn’t know I was going to react like that until I seen him. I just want to see justice done, for him to get what he need to get. ”",0
23635,Bus drivers no longer in charge of quantitative easing,"November 17, 2016 
Global financial markets were in turmoil today after a Leeds bus driver announced that ‘I’m not the f*@king Bank of England, mate’, after a passenger tried to pay for a £2.80 fare with a ten pound note. The surprise revelation triggered an immediate worldwide crash, as speculators and investors reacted to the shock news that the bus driving community was not responsible for maintaining the monetary and financial stability of the nation, as had been previously thought. 
‘This news has sent a tremor through the banking system, as bus drivers have been the custodians of British currency since 1634,’ noted financial historian Michael Porteous. ‘It should have actually been 1631, but Frank was three minutes late leaving the Kirkstall Road depot this afternoon due to roadworks on the A65’. 
‘Drivers are given updates every minute from the major global stock exchanges, relayed to them on tiny screens attached to their rear view mirror’, continued Porteous. ‘This allows them to make split-second adjustments, releasing particular coins into general circulation from those little trigger dispensers if more liquidity is required, or retaining them to meet government monetary targets. More bloody retention than releasing, you say? I couldn’t comment.’ 
Up until recently drivers were trained up to ask belligerently ‘Have you NOT got anything less?’ when any note was offered as payment, before throwing a fistful of low-denomination copper at passengers. They were also mandated to regularly drive past bus-stops full of pensioners on rainy Fridays between 9-11am, if inflation targets had been overshot. ‘Their role in ensuring the financial system runs smoothly shouldn’t be under-estimated,’ concluded Porteous. ‘That’s why your bus driver never even acknowledges you when you get on and looks fixedly into the middle-distance – they’re making complex split-second asset purchase calculations. Alternatively, it may be because they despise you, with that pathetic excuse of a hail that you do, arm half bent and shaking, every sodding day, before getting on and trying to pay with a bloody twenty for your pathetic one-mile journey. For Christ’s sake, can’t you look for some pound coins before you leave, you selfish, middle class tw@t.’ Share this story...

23638,South China Sea Row: China 'Prepared' For War Readies First Aircraft Carrier For Deployment,"Comment 
Amid the seemingly friendlier atmosphere in the South China Sea, China was reportedly in a ‘ready for combat’ position as it prepares to position its first aircraft carrier in the region. 
While some claimant countries in the highly disputed maritime zone, such as the Philippines, have shifted their foreign policies and began dealing with China bilaterally, tension in the region is far from over. Asserts Position In The Region 
As reported by the state-run news website the Global Times , China is battle ready and is prepared for any possibilities or conflict that may arise in the region. The aircraft carrier, Liaoning, is the first of its kind in the Chinese Navy. 
Also Read: South China Sea Row – What Will Happen Now As Donald Trump Enters The Picture? 
The 60,000-ton Liaoning sports a launch pad that is much wider than a typical football field. This aircraft launcher also features high-tech military capabilities that China can use in performing its patrols and surveillance in the region. 
But Li Dongyou, a Chinese political commissar who was aboard the Liaoning, said the showing off of the aircraft carrier was not intended to ignite tension in the region. Always War Ready 
“As a military force, we are always prepared for war and our combat capacity also needs to be tested by war. At this moment, we are doing our best to promote our strength and use it to prevent war, and are prepared for actual combat at any time,” Dongyou was also quoted saying by the Global Times .

23642,Nickelodeon Wades Into Princess Politics - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   Now it’s war: Nickelodeon, once again winning the children’s ratings race against Disney Channel, has decided to throw its weight behind . .. a princess. Nickelodeon has always had its share of magical kingdoms, but this   cable network has tended to leave the princess business to Disney. (And what a business it is, generating an estimated $5. 5 billion a year in merchandise revenue alone.) But here comes “Nella the Princess Knight,” which Nickelodeon will introduce on Monday in a programming block for preschoolers. The   Princess Police, mostly academics who use Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and their slender ilk to make  points about their negative impact on young girls, have been a perennial thorn in Disney’s side, even as the company has introduced black and Latina royals, along with a preschool one, “Sofia the First. ” Will Nickelodeon now find itself in a similar position? Maybe not. The   Nella pushes boundaries, at least for television aimed at    in the areas of race and gender. She is biracial, with a black father and a white mother, a decision informed by Nickelodeon research indicating that most children under 12 will be nonwhite by 2020 and that already 17 percent are biracial. The character also mashes together traditional boy and girl gender norms. Nella may ride a unicorn with a pink mane (à la My Little Pony) but she does it while brandishing a sword and wearing knight gear, a bit like a preschool version of Brienne of Tarth from “Game of Thrones. ” She is a girlie girl but does traditional boy activities (battling a dragon) and does not spend the majority of her time in a ball gown. Nickelodeon’s princess may strike some adults as subversive, particularly given the surge of conservatism that helped push Donald J. Trump into office. But children see   families and the blurring of gender lines as normal, said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon’s longtime chief. “Adults might say, ‘Oh, look  —   she’s biracial,’ but our viewers just say, ‘That looks like my friend,’” she said. “An older generation was taught tolerance, and this audience is demanding difference,” said Ms. Zarghami. She led Nickelodeon to ratings strength in 2016 among total viewers and children ages 2 to 11, even as competitors like Disney Channel and Cartoon Network recorded sharp    drops. (According to Nielsen, Disney still has a big lead among viewers 6 to 14.) She added, “This series seems to be taking on a life of its own, which is incredibly exciting. ”",0
23643,Election Eve Poll in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District: Republican Handel Leads by 2 - Breitbart,"Republican Karen Handel leads Democrat Jon Ossoff by two points in the final poll of Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District special election released by the Trafalgar Group late Monday afternoon. [Polling places open less than 24 hours from now for the June 20 runoff to replace Rep. Tom Price ( ) now the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The survey of 1, 100 respondents has a margin of error of 2. 9 percent, and was conducted over two days between June 17th (Saturday) and June 18th (Sunday). “This 6th District survey breaks down the voter’s preference in the 2017 special election runoff. The Trafalgar Group (TFG) recognized for having the best polling in the 2016 battleground states and Electoral College projection, conducted the poll from June 17th through June 18th,” according to the polling firm’s release: The voters were asked their preferred candidate in the Congressional District 6 race. The results were: 50. 46% Handel48. 59% Ossoff0. 95% Undecided, The Trafalgar Group noted that “[t]he results for those who claimed to have already voted “early” are as follows: 51. 32% Ossoff, 48. 68% Handel. ” “The Handel momentum we saw last week continues and has been intensified as Handel consolidates Republican leaning voters,” Robert Cahaly of the Trafalgar Group said of the latest poll. He went on to say: There is no doubt in my mind that the shooting at the GOP Congressional Baseball practice has had an impact, but I don’t see that it is the impact that most pundits expect. This tragedy and the attempt to place the blame on   rhetoric has actually served to motivate frustrated Republicans who were considering sitting the election out or voting for Ossoff. The shift we see toward Handel in the closing days of this race is a bit of GOP homecoming. These disenchanted Republicans are beginning to put their concerns aside and see this election as a choice —  a choice between the Party and leaders they’re disappointed in and a Democrat Party and leaders that trouble them even more. Two polls released on Friday by   Savvy and   Communications showed the race in a statistical tie. Ossoff had a 1. 7 percent lead in the    Communications poll and less than one percent lead in the   Savvy poll. Since the margin of error for the Trafalgar Group poll released on Monday is 2. 9 percent, the two percent Handel advantage is also within the margin of error. The Trafalgar Group is primarily used by Republican candidates. It has a strong recent track record, as it notes in its release: The Trafalgar Group is widely recognized as the best polling firm of the 2016 election cycle, correctly forecasting the results in key battleground and other states (PA, FL, NC, MI, OH, CO, GA) and exactly predicting the Trump electoral college margin of victory ( ). The results and information of their polls have been featured in thousands of U. S. and global news stories, television networks, and   polling web sites like Real Clear Politics.

23644,Sen. David Perdue Takes to Senate Floor to Defend AG Jeff Sessions: ’He Is a Man of Integrity’ - Breitbart,"The only Fortune 500 CEO serving in Congress rose to support Attorney General Jeff Sessions less than six hours after Sen. Charles Schumer (D. . Y.) the leader of the Senate Democrats, called upon Sessions to resign because he met with the Russian ambassador in 2016 as a senator. [“I rise today to speak in defense of a dear colleague of ours, who is now the Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said Sen. David Perdue (R. .) who like Sessions was a campaign surrogate for President Donald Trump.  “He is my friend, and more importantly, he is a former colleague of this very body,” he said. “He’s a man of integrity. He is a man of principle. I trust him and I take him at his word,” the senator said. Perdue said that Sessions has repeatedly pledged that he would recuse himself from any investigations into Russian meddling in the American political process during the 2016 election cycle. The attacks on Sessions surprised Perdue, he said. “I’ve never witnessed anything quite like this in my brief time in the United States Senate,” he said. “The last two years have been very interesting, but never have I seen the hypocrisy that we see going on around this one issue. It is increasingly clear that the Minority Party is singularly focused on sabotaging this new administration at every turn. ” Perdue said it should be remembered that Senate Democrats have used every possible delaying tactic or procedure to hamper the president from building his team. “Our President today, as we stand here in this well, cannot have a staff meeting because he doesn’t have all of his Cabinet members in place. ” Without mentioning her name, Perdue pointed out that Sen. Claire McCaskill (D. .) Tweeted that she never met with the Russians, only to have her own Twitter feed contradict her. Claire McCaskill says she’s had “no call or meeting   ambassador. Ever. ” But she tweeted about two. It’s easy to forget. pic. twitter.   —   Charles C. W.

Perdue said the Democrats are desperate to spin up scandals, while Republicans are working to reverse the damage done to America and the world by President Barack Obama and his policies. That does not mean that the Russians are not a concern, he said. The Russians have invaded their neighbors, threatened our friends, and destabilized regions, such as the Middle East, he said. “Until there is a definite proof that Russians changed a single vote from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump, I will be focused on one thing, and that is doing exactly what the American people sent us up here to do —  and I encourage my colleagues to do the same —  and that is not to engage in political theater for the sake of partisan politics, but working together to get America back to work,” he said.

23656,Uber Seeks to Prevent Use of Greyball to Thwart Regulators - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   The   service Uber said on Wednesday that it would prohibit employees from using a program called Greyball to thwart regulators. Uber’s new policy pertaining to the use of Greyball, a tool the company developed to show individual riders different versions of its app, comes in the aftermath of a New York Times article that outlined how the company had used the tool to identify and avoid local regulators who were investigating the service. The article, which cited four former and current Uber employees, said the company had used Greyball to thwart authorities in various cities in the United States and other countries. In a statement on Wednesday, Joe Sullivan, Uber’s chief security officer, said the company was conducting a review of how the technology had been used. “We are expressly prohibiting its use to target action by local regulators going forward,” Mr. Sullivan said. “Given the way our systems are configured, it will take some time to ensure this prohibition is fully enforced. ” A company spokesman, asked why Uber could not fully enforce the prohibition immediately, declined to elaborate further. Uber said that a number of organizations had inquired about the program and that the company planned to respond once it finished its review. Last week, Marietje Schaake, a member of the European Parliament for the Dutch Democratic Party in the Netherlands, wrote to the European Commission asking if it planned to investigate the company’s use of Greyball. In addition, officials in Portland, Ore. called for an investigation into Uber’s use of Greyball there. In 2014, Uber started offering its     service in Portland without getting permission. The city later declared it illegal. Law enforcement officers posed as riders during their investigation of the service but were unable to catch Uber drivers in the act. It appeared as though Uber was using Greyball to avoid the officers. In one instance, a code enforcement officer in Portland who opened the Uber app would see representations of cars on the app’s map. But the cars themselves never materialized. And the cars they were able to hail would cancel the ride before they arrived. The revelation about Uber’s use of Greyball added to the company’s recent stream of bad news. In January, Uber contended with a #deleteUber campaign by riders who thought the company was trying to take advantage of a taxi strike at Kennedy International Airport in New York. (Local taxi drivers were protesting President Trump’s immigration ban.) Last month, Uber faced increasing criticism of its workplace culture and was embroiled in a lawsuit over its   cars. And last week, the company dealt with concerns regarding the temperament of its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, after a video of him berating an Uber driver became public. The company did not say, however, that it planned to prohibit the use of Greyball in all instances. Uber said it used the technology for many purposes, including the testing of new features by employees, marketing promotions, and the deterring of riders using the app in violation of its terms of services. Greyball came out of an Uber program called VTOS, short for “violation of terms of service,” which the company says it created in part to identify people it thought were using its service improperly. The program began as early as 2014 and remains in use, mostly outside the United States. Uber’s legal team approved the use of Greyball. Uber employees said the practices and tools came about partly because of a need to protect drivers who had been the target of violence in a number of countries. In France, India and Kenya, for instance, taxi companies and workers attacked new Uber drivers.",0

23669,Report: More Americans Between 18 and 34 Live with Parents Than Spouse - Breitbart,"More Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 live with their parents than with a spouse, according to a new study. [In 1975, 31. 9 million young people lived with a spouse, compared to just 19. 9 million in 2016, while the number of young people staying with their parents has risen from 14. 7 million to 22. 9 million, according to the U. S. Census Bureau.  Despite this vast difference, the number of young unmarried partners living together has risen from around 700, 000 to over 9. 2 million, while the number of young people living alone has also gone up from 5 percent to 8 percent. “What does it mean to be a young adult? In prior generations, young adults were expected to have finished school, found a job, and set up their own household during their 20s —  most often with their spouse and with a child soon to follow,” explained the Census Bureau study. “Today’s young adults take longer to experience these milestones. ” “What was once ubiquitous during their 20s is now not commonplace until their 30s. Some demographers believe the delays represent a new period of the life course between childhood and adulthood, a period of ’emerging adulthood’ when young people experience traditional events at different times and in a different order than their parents did,” they continued. “What is clear is that today’s young adults look different from prior generations in almost every regard: how much education they have, their work experiences, when they start a family, and even who they live with while growing up. ” The report also added, “More young men are falling to the bottom of the income ladder,” pointing out that “In 1975, only 25 percent of men, aged 25 to 34, had incomes of less than $30, 000 per year. ” “By 2016, that share rose to 41 percent of young men (incomes for both years are in 2015 dollars),” they continued. “There are now more young women than young men with a college degree, whereas in 1975 educational attainment among young men outpaced that of women. ” The majority of states with the highest number of young people staying with their parents were predominantly coastal. New Jersey took the top position with 46. 9 percent of   to    staying at home, followed by Connecticut (41. 6 percent) New York (40. 6 percent) Maryland (38. 5 percent) Florida (38. 3 percent) and California (38. 1 percent). At the bottom with the least amount of young people living with their parents was North Dakota with 14. 1 percent, following by South Dakota (19. 9 percent) Wyoming (20. 9 percent) Nebraska (22. 7 percent) Iowa (22. 8 percent) Montana (24. 1 percent) and Colorado (24. 6 percent).

23671,"Umfrage: CETA würde enorm an Zustimmung gewinnen, wenn EU kanadische Cannabis-Standards übernehmen müsste","  Umfrage: CETA würde enorm an Zustimmung gewinnen, wenn EU kanadische Cannabis-Standards übernehmen müsste Brüssel (dpo) - Das könnte die Wende im Streit um CETA bedeuten: Einer neuen Umfrage zufolge würde die Zustimmung der EU-Bevölkerung für das Freihandelsabkommen mit einem Schlag auf bisher unerreichte Werte steigen, wenn der Vertrag die Europäische Union dazu zwingen würde, beim Umgang mit Cannabis kanadische Standards zu übernehmen. Denn was viele CETA-Kritiker hierzulande nicht bedenken: Die kanadische Regierung unter Premierminister Justin Trudeau bereitet zurzeit eine vollkommene Freigabe von Marihuana und anderen berauschenden Hanfprodukten vor . Schon jetzt wird der Besitz und Konsum dieser Rauschmittel in der Praxis nicht verfolgt. Kommt das ""Gebt das Hanf frei!""-Handelsabkommen? Sollte CETA zur Folge haben, dass auch die EU Cannabis legalisieren müsste, wäre plötzlich ein Großteil der europäischen Bevölkerung für das Zustandekommen des Abkommens. ""Rund 78 Prozent aller Europäer würden dann dafür plädieren, CETA unter dieser Voraussetzung so schnell wie möglich zu unterzeichnen"", sagte Dr. Martin Heumann von der Universität Wien, der die Umfrage unter mehr als 12.000 EU-Bürgern koordinierte. ""Und zwar am besten noch diese Woche, bevor die letzten Brösel aufgebraucht sind und sie sich um völlig überteuerten Nachschub auf dem Schwarzmarkt kümmern müssen."" Einzige Ausnahme: Während die Zustimmung für CETA unter dieser Voraussetzung überall sonst sprunghaft anstieg, ließ sich bei Umfrageteilnehmern aus den Niederlanden kein messbarer Unterschied feststellen. Ersten Schätzungen zufolge dürfte das Handelsvolumen an Cannabisprodukten zwischen der EU und Kanada innerhalb kürzester Zeit um etwa 21.000.000.000 Prozent steigen (aktuell: 50 Euro monatlich, weil Sandro Keller aus Dörmagen sein Haschisch aus unerfindlichen Gründen aus Quebec bezieht) belaufen. Derzeit werde geprüft, wieviel Gramm Marihuana auf ein Containerschiff dieser Klasse passen: Letztlich hätte eine Legalisierung wohl auch für Brüssel entscheidende Vorteile. Heumann: ""Sobald die neue Drogenpolitik greift, werden die Bürger auch die negativen Folgen von CETA zufrieden grinsend ertragen. Das kann jedem EU-Politiker nur genehm sein!"" pfg, ssi, dan; Foto [M]: Shutterstock Artikel teilen:",0
